However, we have found that natural infection with XBB subvariants, including XBB.1.5, does not efficiently induce humoral immunity against the infecting XBB subvariants. These observations raise the possibility that the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine may not be able to efficiently induce humoral immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including a variety of XBB subvariants (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1 and HK.3) as well as BA.2.86. To address this possibility, we collected two types of sera from individuals vaccinated with the XBB.1.5 vaccine; those who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who had been infected with XBB subvariants prior to XBB.1.5 vaccination. We collected sera before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination, and then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses.\nThermal and pigment characterization of environmental fungi in the urban heat island of Baltimore City\nAuthors: Smith, D. F. Q.; Faiez, T. S.; Bencomo, A.; Casadevall, A.\nScore: 39.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566554\nOne of the major barriers of fungal infections of mammals is the inability to grow and/or survive at mammalian body temperature, typically around 37{degrees}C. This has provided mammals an advantage over fungi. However, environmental fungi may soon adapt to persist at higher temperatures, consistent with mammalian body temperature, due to thermal selection pressures imposed by climate change, global warming, and increased frequency of extreme heat events. Consequently, there is a need for more updated information about the thermal tolerance range of fungi near humans, such as in urban areas. The heat island effect suggests that cities are up to 8{degrees}C warmer than their suburban counterparts because of increased heat production, asphalt coatings and reduced greenspace among other factors, and it is more common in lower income and marginalized urban communities. Thus, urban centers are at increased risk for the emergence of heat tolerant fungi. In this study, we developed a methodology to collect and archive fungal isolates from sidewalk and soil samples in both warmer and cooler neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland. We demonstrate a novel methodology for fungal sample collection from sidewalks, employing the use of standardized and commercially available taffy. Analysis of fungal isolates collected from warmer neighborhoods revealed greater thermal tolerance and lower pigmentation, suggesting local adaptation to heat. Lower pigmentation in hotter areas is consistent with the notion that fungi use pigmentation to help regulate their temperature. Further, we identified the robust presence of the polyextremotolerant fungus Aureobasidium pullalans from the warmest neighborhood in Baltimore, further showing that the extreme conditions of cities can drive proliferation of extremotolerant fungi. This study develops new techniques for environmental fungal collection and provides insight on the fungal census in an urban setting that can inform future work to study how urban environments may drive stress/thermotolerance in fungi, which could alter fungal interactions with humans and impact human health.\nHigh defense system expression broadens protection range at the cost of increased autoimmunity\nAuthors: Aframian, N.; Omer-Bendori, S.; Hen, T.; Guler, P.; Eldar, A.\nScore: 30.9, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569366\nThe evolutionary arms race between bacteria and their phage viruses has given rise to elaborate anti-phage defense mechanisms. Major advances have been made in revealing the molecular details underlying diverse defense systems, but general principles and constraints are largely unknown. Defense systems are often tested against a diverse set of phages, revealing widely varying protection ranges. While these disparities are usually attributed to differences in mechanism, here we show that increasing expression of defense systems can greatly enhance their protection range. This holds true for disparate mechanisms, and is achieved by circumventing phage strategies for overcoming bacterial defense. However, increased defense system expression comes with a heavy cost of autoimmunity. Therefore, the expression level of defense systems controls a tradeoff between protection range on the one hand and autoimmunity on the other. We discuss how this tradeoff may drive the regulation of defense systems expression and the acquisition of multiple systems within the same genome.\nInteractions between the gut microbiome, dietary restriction, and aging in genetically diverse mice\nAuthors: Litichevskiy, L.; Considine, M.; Gill, J.; Shandar, V.; Cox, T. O.; Descamps, H. C.; Wright, K. M.; Amses, K. R.; Dohnalova, L.; Liou, M. J.; Tetlak, M.; Galindo-Fiallos, M. R.; Wong, A. C.; Lundgren, P.; Kim, J.; Uhr, G. T.; Rahman, R.

S.; Li, H.; Barnett, I.; Davenport, E. R.; Broman, K. W.; Cohen, R. L.; Botstein, D.; Freund, A.; Di Francesco, A.; Churchill, G. A.; Li, M.; Thaiss, C. A.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568137\nThe intestinal microbiome changes with age, but the causes and consequences of microbiome aging remain unclear. Furthermore, the gut microbiome has been proposed to mediate the benefit of lifespan- extending interventions such as dietary restriction, but this hypothesis warrants further exploration. Here, by analyzing 2997 metagenomes collected longitudinally from 913 deeply phenotyped, genetically diverse mice, we provide new insights into the interplay between the microbiome, aging, dietary restriction, host genetics, and a wide range of health parameters. First, we find that microbiome uniqueness increases with age across datasets and species. Moreover, age-associated changes are better explained by cumulative exposure to stochastic events (neutral theory) than by the influence of an aging host (selection theory). Second, we unexpectedly find that the majority of microbiome features are significantly heritable and that the amount of variation explained by host genetics is as large as that of aging and dietary restriction. Third, we find that the intensity of dietary restriction parallels the extent of microbiome changes and that dietary restriction does not rejuvenate the microbiome. Lastly, we find that the microbiome is significantly associated with multiple health parameters -- including body composition, immune parameters, and frailty -- but not with lifespan. In summary, this large and multifaceted study sheds light on the factors influencing the microbiome and aspects of host physiology modulated by the microbiome.\nDNA methylation by CcrM contributes to genome maintenance in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens plant pathogen\nAuthors: Martin, S.; Fournes, F.; Ambrosini, G.; Iseli, C.; BOJKOWSKA, K.; Marquis, J.; Guex, N.; Collier, J.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569018\nThe cell cycle-regulated DNA methyltransferase CcrM is conserved in most Alphaproteobacteria, but its role in bacteria with complex or multicentric genomes remains unexplored. Here, we compare the methylome, the transcriptome and the phenotypes of wild-type and CcrM-depleted Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells with a dicentric genome with two essential replication origins. We find that DNA methylation has a pleiotropic impact on motility, biofilm formation and viability. Remarkably, CcrM promotes the expression of the repABCCh2 operon, encoding proteins required for replication initiation/partitioning at ori2, and inhibits gcrA, encoding a conserved global cell cycle regulator. Imaging ori1 and ori2 in live cells, we show that replication from ori2 is often delayed in cells with a hypo-methylated genome, while ori2 over-initiates in cells with a hyper-methylated genome. We thus propose that methylation by CcrM stimulates RepABC-dependent chromosomal origins, uncovering a novel and original connection between CcrM-dependent DNA methylation and genome maintenance in an Alphaproteobacterial pathogen.\nConvergent evolution in toxin detection and resistance provides evidence for conserved bacterial-fungal interactions\nAuthors: Dolan, S. K.; Duong, A. T.; Whiteley, M.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568923\nMicrobes rarely exist in isolation, and instead form complex polymicrobial communities. As a result, microbes have developed intricate offensive and defensive strategies that enhance their fitness in these complex communities. Thus, identifying and understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling polymicrobial interactions is critical for understanding the function of microbial communities. In this study, we show that the Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which frequently causes infection alongside a plethora of other microbes including fungi, encodes a genetic network which can detect, and defend against gliotoxin, a potent, disulfide-containing antimicrobial produced by the ubiquitous filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. We show that gliotoxin exposure disrupts P. aeruginosa zinc homeostasis, leading to transcriptional activation of a gene encoding a previously uncharacterized dithiol oxidase (DnoP), which detoxifies gliotoxin and structurally related toxins. While the enzymatic activity of DnoP is identical to that used by A. fumigatus to protect itself against gliotoxin, DnoP shares little homology to the A. fumigatus gliotoxin resistance protein. Thus, DnoP and its transcriptional induction by low zinc represent an example of both convergent evolution of toxin defense and environmental cue sensing across kingdoms. Collectively, these data support disulfide-containing natural products as mediators of inter-kingdom interactions and provide evidence that P. aeruginosa has evolved to survive exposure to these molecules in the natural environment. Significance statementBacteria and fungi frequently exist as complex, polymicrobial communities during infection. Reconstructing ecological structure in the laboratory is challenging and, consequently, the precise molecular mechanisms which underpin microbial interactions remain elusive. Using a pre-clinical model that mimics the cystic fibrosis lung, we discovered that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects and defends against a disulfide-containing toxin produced by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. In an example of both convergent evolution of toxin defense and environmental cue sensing across kingdoms, we discovered that these organisms use the same cue to produce/sense this toxin, and the same enzymatic mechanism to protect against toxicity. This discovery of convergent evolution provides strong evidence for P. aeruginosa exposure to microbially-produced disulfide-containing toxins in natural environments.\nDistinct dynamics and proximity networks of hub proteins at the prey-invading cell pole in a predatory bacterium\nAuthors: Remy, O.; Santin, Y. G.; Jonckheere, V.; Tesseur, C.; Kaljevic, J.; Van Damme, P.; Laloux, G.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569176\nIn bacteria, cell poles function as subcellular compartments where proteins localize during specific lifecycle stages, orchestrated by polar \"hub\" proteins. Whereas most described bacteria inherit an \"old\" pole from the mother cell and a \"new\" pole from cell division, polarizing cells at birth, non-binary division poses challenges for establishing cell polarity, particularly for daughter cells inheriting only new poles. We investigated polarity dynamics in the obligate predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, proliferating through filamentous growth followed by non-binary division within prey bacteria. Monitoring the subcellular localization of two proteins known as polar hubs in other species, RomR and DivIVA, revealed RomR as an early polarity marker in B. bacteriovorus. RomR already marks the future anterior poles of the progeny during the predators growth phase, in a define time window closely following the onset of divisome assembly and the end of chromosome segregation. In contrast to RomRs stable unipolar localization in the progeny, DivIVA exhibits a dynamic pole-to-pole localization. This behaviour changes shortly before division of the elongated predator cell, where DivIVA accumulates at all septa and both poles. In vivo protein interaction networks for DivIVA and RomR, mapped through endogenous miniTurbo-based proximity labeling, further underscore their distinct roles in cell polarization and the importance of the anterior \"invasive\" cell pole in prey-predator interactions. Our work emphasizes the strict spatiotemporal coordination of cellular processes underlying B. bacteriovorus proliferation, offering insights into the subcellular organization of bacteria with filamentous growth and non-binary division.\nEmergence and spread of feline infectious peritonitis due to a highly pathogenic canine/feline recombinant coronavirus\nAuthors: Atippa, C.; Warr, A. S.; Epaminondas, D.; O'Shea, M.; Fletcher, S. L.; Malbon, A.; Lyraki, M.; Hammond, R.; Hardas, A.; Zanti, A.; Loukaidou, S.; Gentil, M.; Gunn-Moore, D.; Mazeri, S.; Tait-Burkard, C.\nScore: 244.0, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566182\nCross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1-3. Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed and demonstrated4-7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The recombination, spanning spike, shows 97% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus CB/05. Infection is spreading fast and infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears rapid and likely non-reliant on biotype switch12. High sequence identity of isolates from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A deletion and several amino acid changes in spike, particularly the receptor binding domain, compared to other FCoV-2s, indicate changes to receptor binding and likely cell tropism.\nDetection and spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus H5N1 in the Antarctic Region\nAuthors: Bennison, A.; Byrne, A. M.; Reid, S. M.; Lynton-Jenkins, J. G.; Mollett, B.; De Sliva, D.; Peers-Dent, J.; Finlayson, K. E.; Hall, R.; Blockley, F.; Blyth, M.; Falchieri, M.; Fowler, Z.; Fitzcharles, E.; Brown, I. H.; James, J.; Banyard, A. C.\nScore: 34.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568045\nThe Antarctic is the only major geographical region in which high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) has never previously been detected. The current panzootic of H5N1 HPAIV has decimated wild bird populations across Europe, North America and South America. Here we report on the emergence of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands respectively. We initially detected H5N1 HPAIV in samples collected from brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia on 8th October 2023. Since this detection, increased mortalities were observed in brown skuas, kelp gulls, elephant seals and fur seal at multiple sites across South Georgia. We confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in multiple brown skuas and kelp gulls across four different sampling locations in South Georgia. Simultaneously, we also confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in a southern fulmar in the Falkland Islands. Genetic assessment of the virus indicates spread from South America, likely through movement of migratory birds. Here we describe the emergence, species impact and genetic composition of the virus and propose both introductory routes and potential long-term impact on avian and mammalian species across the Antarctic region.\nFunctional and antigenic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike fusion peptide by deep mutational scanning\nAuthors: Lei, R.; Qing, E.; Odle, A.; Yuan, M.; Tan, T. J. C.; So, N.; Ouyang, W. O.; Wilson, I. A.; Gallagher, T.; Perlman, S.; Wu, N. C.; Wong, L. Y. R.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569051\nThe fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is functionally important for membrane fusion during virus entry and is part of a broadly neutralizing epitope. However, sequence determinants at the fusion peptide and its adjacent regions for pathogenicity and antigenicity remain elusive. In this study, we performed a series of deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on an S2 region spanning the fusion peptide of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines and in the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. We identified mutations at residue 813 of the spike protein that reduced TMPRSS2-mediated entry with decreased virulence. In addition, we showed that an F823Y mutation, present in bat betacoronavirus HKU9 spike protein, confers resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and also highlight a potential challenge in developing broadly protective S2-based coronavirus vaccines.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To control infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine has been available since September 2023. However, we have found that natural infection with XBB subvariants, including XBB.1.5, does not efficiently induce humoral immunity against the infecting XBB subvariants. These observations raise the possibility that the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine may not be able to efficiently induce humoral immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including a variety of XBB subvariants (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1 and HK.3) as well as BA.2.86. To address this possibility, we collected two types of sera from individuals vaccinated with the XBB.1.5 vaccine; those who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who had been infected with XBB subvariants prior to XBB.1.5 vaccination. We collected sera before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination, and then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the major barriers of fungal infections of mammals is the inability to grow and/or survive at mammalian body temperature, typically around 37{degrees}C. This has provided mammals an advantage over fungi. However, environmental fungi may soon adapt to persist at higher temperatures, consistent with mammalian body temperature, due to thermal selection pressures imposed by climate change, global warming, and increased frequency of extreme heat events. Consequently, there is a need for more updated information about the thermal tolerance range of fungi near humans, such as in urban areas. The heat island effect suggests that cities are up to 8{degrees}C warmer than their suburban counterparts because of increased heat production, asphalt coatings and reduced greenspace among other factors, and it is more common in lower income and marginalized urban communities. Thus, urban centers are at increased risk for the emergence of heat tolerant fungi. In this study, we developed a methodology to collect and archive fungal isolates from sidewalk and soil samples in both warmer and cooler neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland. We demonstrate a novel methodology for fungal sample collection from sidewalks, employing the use of standardized and commercially available taffy. Analysis of fungal isolates collected from warmer neighborhoods revealed greater thermal tolerance and lower pigmentation, suggesting local adaptation to heat. Lower pigmentation in hotter areas is consistent with the notion that fungi use pigmentation to help regulate their temperature. Further, we identified the robust presence of the polyextremotolerant fungus Aureobasidium pullalans from the warmest neighborhood in Baltimore, further showing that the extreme conditions of cities can drive proliferation of extremotolerant fungi. This study develops new techniques for environmental fungal collection and provides insight on the fungal census in an urban setting that can inform future work to study how urban environments may drive stress/thermotolerance in fungi, which could alter fungal interactions with humans and impact human health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evolutionary arms race between bacteria and their phage viruses has given rise to elaborate anti-phage defense mechanisms. Major advances have been made in revealing the molecular details underlying diverse defense systems, but general principles and constraints are largely unknown. Defense systems are often tested against a diverse set of phages, revealing widely varying protection ranges. While these disparities are usually attributed to differences in mechanism, here we show that increasing expression of defense systems can greatly enhance their protection range. This holds true for disparate mechanisms, and is achieved by circumventing phage strategies for overcoming bacterial defense. However, increased defense system expression comes with a heavy cost of autoimmunity. Therefore, the expression level of defense systems controls a tradeoff between protection range on the one hand and autoimmunity on the other. We discuss how this tradeoff may drive the regulation of defense systems expression and the acquisition of multiple systems within the same genome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intestinal microbiome changes with age, but the causes and consequences of microbiome aging remain unclear. Furthermore, the gut microbiome has been proposed to mediate the benefit of lifespan- extending interventions such as dietary restriction, but this hypothesis warrants further exploration. Here, by analyzing 2997 metagenomes collected longitudinally from 913 deeply phenotyped, genetically diverse mice, we provide new insights into the interplay between the microbiome, aging, dietary restriction, host genetics, and a wide range of health parameters. First, we find that microbiome uniqueness increases with age across datasets and species. Moreover, age-associated changes are better explained by cumulative exposure to stochastic events (neutral theory) than by the influence of an aging host (selection theory). Second, we unexpectedly find that the majority of microbiome features are significantly heritable and that the amount of variation explained by host genetics is as large as that of aging and dietary restriction. Third, we find that the intensity of dietary restriction parallels the extent of microbiome changes and that dietary restriction does not rejuvenate the microbiome. Lastly, we find that the microbiome is significantly associated with multiple health parameters -- including body composition, immune parameters, and frailty -- but not with lifespan. In summary, this large and multifaceted study sheds light on the factors influencing the microbiome and aspects of host physiology modulated by the microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cell cycle-regulated DNA methyltransferase CcrM is conserved in most Alphaproteobacteria, but its role in bacteria with complex or multicentric genomes remains unexplored. Here, we compare the methylome, the transcriptome and the phenotypes of wild-type and CcrM-depleted Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells with a dicentric genome with two essential replication origins. We find that DNA methylation has a pleiotropic impact on motility, biofilm formation and viability. Remarkably, CcrM promotes the expression of the repABCCh2 operon, encoding proteins required for replication initiation/partitioning at ori2, and inhibits gcrA, encoding a conserved global cell cycle regulator. Imaging ori1 and ori2 in live cells, we show that replication from ori2 is often delayed in cells with a hypo-methylated genome, while ori2 over-initiates in cells with a hyper-methylated genome. We thus propose that methylation by CcrM stimulates RepABC-dependent chromosomal origins, uncovering a novel and original connection between CcrM-dependent DNA methylation and genome maintenance in an Alphaproteobacterial pathogen.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbes rarely exist in isolation, and instead form complex polymicrobial communities. As a result, microbes have developed intricate offensive and defensive strategies that enhance their fitness in these complex communities. Thus, identifying and understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling polymicrobial interactions is critical for understanding the function of microbial communities. In this study, we show that the Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which frequently causes infection alongside a plethora of other microbes including fungi, encodes a genetic network which can detect, and defend against gliotoxin, a potent, disulfide-containing antimicrobial produced by the ubiquitous filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. We show that gliotoxin exposure disrupts P. aeruginosa zinc homeostasis, leading to transcriptional activation of a gene encoding a previously uncharacterized dithiol oxidase (DnoP), which detoxifies gliotoxin and structurally related toxins. While the enzymatic activity of DnoP is identical to that used by A. fumigatus to protect itself against gliotoxin, DnoP shares little homology to the A. fumigatus gliotoxin resistance protein. Thus, DnoP and its transcriptional induction by low zinc represent an example of both convergent evolution of toxin defense and environmental cue sensing across kingdoms. Collectively, these data support disulfide-containing natural products as mediators of inter-kingdom interactions and provide evidence that P. aeruginosa has evolved to survive exposure to these molecules in the natural environment.

Significance statementBacteria and fungi frequently exist as complex, polymicrobial communities during infection. Reconstructing ecological structure in the laboratory is challenging and, consequently, the precise molecular mechanisms which underpin microbial interactions remain elusive. Using a pre-clinical model that mimics the cystic fibrosis lung, we discovered that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects and defends against a disulfide-containing toxin produced by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. In an example of both convergent evolution of toxin defense and environmental cue sensing across kingdoms, we discovered that these organisms use the same cue to produce/sense this toxin, and the same enzymatic mechanism to protect against toxicity. This discovery of convergent evolution provides strong evidence for P. aeruginosa exposure to microbially-produced disulfide-containing toxins in natural environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In bacteria, cell poles function as subcellular compartments where proteins localize during specific lifecycle stages, orchestrated by polar &#34;hub&#34; proteins. Whereas most described bacteria inherit an &#34;old&#34; pole from the mother cell and a &#34;new&#34; pole from cell division, polarizing cells at birth, non-binary division poses challenges for establishing cell polarity, particularly for daughter cells inheriting only new poles. We investigated polarity dynamics in the obligate predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, proliferating through filamentous growth followed by non-binary division within prey bacteria. Monitoring the subcellular localization of two proteins known as polar hubs in other species, RomR and DivIVA, revealed RomR as an early polarity marker in B. bacteriovorus. RomR already marks the future anterior poles of the progeny during the predators growth phase, in a define time window closely following the onset of divisome assembly and the end of chromosome segregation. In contrast to RomRs stable unipolar localization in the progeny, DivIVA exhibits a dynamic pole-to-pole localization. This behaviour changes shortly before division of the elongated predator cell, where DivIVA accumulates at all septa and both poles. In vivo protein interaction networks for DivIVA and RomR, mapped through endogenous miniTurbo-based proximity labeling, further underscore their distinct roles in cell polarization and the importance of the anterior &#34;invasive&#34; cell pole in prey-predator interactions. Our work emphasizes the strict spatiotemporal coordination of cellular processes underlying B. bacteriovorus proliferation, offering insights into the subcellular organization of bacteria with filamentous growth and non-binary division.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1-3. Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed and demonstrated4-7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The recombination, spanning spike, shows 97% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus CB/05. Infection is spreading fast and infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears rapid and likely non-reliant on biotype switch12. High sequence identity of isolates from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A deletion and several amino acid changes in spike, particularly the receptor binding domain, compared to other FCoV-2s, indicate changes to receptor binding and likely cell tropism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Antarctic is the only major geographical region in which high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) has never previously been detected. The current panzootic of H5N1 HPAIV has decimated wild bird populations across Europe, North America and South America. Here we report on the emergence of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands respectively. We initially detected H5N1 HPAIV in samples collected from brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia on 8th October 2023. Since this detection, increased mortalities were observed in brown skuas, kelp gulls, elephant seals and fur seal at multiple sites across South Georgia. We confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in multiple brown skuas and kelp gulls across four different sampling locations in South Georgia. Simultaneously, we also confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in a southern fulmar in the Falkland Islands. Genetic assessment of the virus indicates spread from South America, likely through movement of migratory birds. Here we describe the emergence, species impact and genetic composition of the virus and propose both introductory routes and potential long-term impact on avian and mammalian species across the Antarctic region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is functionally important for membrane fusion during virus entry and is part of a broadly neutralizing epitope. However, sequence determinants at the fusion peptide and its adjacent regions for pathogenicity and antigenicity remain elusive. In this study, we performed a series of deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on an S2 region spanning the fusion peptide of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines and in the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. We identified mutations at residue 813 of the spike protein that reduced TMPRSS2-mediated entry with decreased virulence. In addition, we showed that an F823Y mutation, present in bat betacoronavirus HKU9 spike protein, confers resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and also highlight a potential challenge in developing broadly protective S2-based coronavirus vaccines.</p>
