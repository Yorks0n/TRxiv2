While other genomics fields have used large, pre-compiled compendia to extract systematic insights requiring otherwise impractical sample sizes, there has been no comparable resource for the 16S rRNA sequencing data commonly used to quantify microbiome composition. To help close this gap, we have assembled a set of 168,484 publicly available human gut microbiome samples, processed with a single pipeline and combined into the largest unified microbiome dataset to date. We use this resource, which is freely available at microbiomap.org, to shed light on global variation in the human gut microbiome. We find that Firmicutes, particularly Bacilli and Clostridia, are almost universally present in the human gut. At the same time, the relative abundance of the 65 most common microbial genera differ between at least two world regions. We also show that gut microbiomes in undersampled world regions, such as Central and Southern Asia, differ significantly from the more thoroughly characterized microbiomes of Europe and Northern America. Moreover, humans in these overlooked regions likely harbor hundreds of taxa that have not yet been discovered due to this undersampling, highlighting the need for diversity in microbiome studies. We anticipate that this new compendium can serve the community and enable advanced applied and methodological research.\nEscherichia coli plasmidome maps the game of clones\nAuthors: Arredondo-Alonso, S.; Pontinen, A. K.; Gama, J.; Gladstone, R. A.; Harms, K.; Tonkin-Hill, G.; Thorpe, H. A.; Simonsen, G. S.; Samuelsen, O.; Johnsen, P. J.; Corander, J.\nScore: 43.4, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562336\nEscherichia coli is a major human pathogen and the most widely studied microbe in history, but its extrachromosomal elements known as plasmids remain poorly delineated. Here we used long-read technology to high-resolution sequence the entire plasmidome and the corresponding host chromosomes from a longitudinal survey covering two decades and over 2,000 E. coli isolates. Separation of chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA enabled us to reconstruct co-evolutionary trajectories of host lineages and their plasmids on a population-wide scale, demonstrating that plasmid evolution is markedly constrained contrary to the established dogma. We find that some plasmids have persisted in lineages for centuries, and provide a high-resolution map of recent vertical and horizontal evolutionary events in plasmids with key antibiotic resistance, competition and virulence determinants. We present genomic evidence of both chromosomal and plasmid-driven success strategies that represent convergent phenotypic evolution in distant lineages, and use in vitro experiments to verify the importance of bacteriocin-producing plasmids for clone success. Our study has general implications for understanding plasmid biology and bacterial evolutionary strategies, and informing development of future interventions against pathogens.\nGenetically refactored Agrobacterium-mediated transformation\nAuthors: Thompson, M.; Kirkpatrick, L. D.; Geiselman, G. M.; Waldburger, L. M.; Pearson, A. N.; Szarzanowicz, M.; Vuu, K. M.; Markel, K.; Hummel, N. F.; Suazo, D. D.; Tahmin, C.; Cui, R.; Liu, S.; Cevallos, J.; Pannu, H.; Liu, D.; Gin, J. W.; Chen, Y.; Petzold, C. J.; Gladden, J.; Keasling, J. D.; Chang, J. H.; Weisberg, A. J.; Shih, P. M.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.561914\nMembers of Agrobacterium are costly plant pathogens while also essential tools for plant transformation. Though Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) has been heavily studied, its polygenic nature and its complex transcriptional regulation make identifying the genetic basis of transformational efficiency difficult through traditional genetic and bioinformatic approaches. Here we use a bottom-up synthetic approach to systematically refactor the tumor-inducing plasmid, wherein the majority of AMT machine components are encoded, into a minimal set of genes capable of plant and fungal transformation that is both controllable and orthogonal to its environment. We demonstrate that engineered vectors can be transferred to new heterologous bacteria, enabling them to transform plants. Our reductionist approach demonstrates how bottom-up engineering can be used to dissect and elucidate the genetic underpinnings of complex biological traits, and may lead to the development of strains of bacteria more capable of transforming recalcitrant plant species of societal importance.\nLong-term dynamics of the 'Serratia marcescens complex' in the hospital-built environment\nAuthors: Aracil-Gisbert, S.; Fernandez-de-Bobadilla, M. D.; Guerra-Pinto, N.; Serrano-Calleja, S.; Perez-Cobas, A. E.; Soriano, C.; De Pablo, R.; Lanza, V. F.; Perez-Viso, B.; Reuter, S.; Hasman, H.; Canton, R.; Baquero, F.; Coque, T. M.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562376\nSerratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen historically associated with abrupt, unpredictable, and severe outbreaks in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and, more recently, with the spread of acquired genes encoding carbapenem resistance. However, the population biology and ecology of S. marcescens in the hospital ecosystem is still poorly understood. Here, we combine epidemiological information of 1417 Serratia isolates collected from the sinks of a large ICU ward that underwent significant demographic and operational changes (2019-2020) and 99 non-redundant outbreak/non-outbreak isolates from the same hospital (2003-2019), with genomic data of 165 isolates. We first report hospital sinks as reservoirs of heterogeneous and coexistent populations of the S. marcescens complex (SMC). A novel SMC clade congruent with the recently described Serratia nevei species is predominant, exhibiting chromosomal AmpC {beta}-lactamase with an unusual basal expression in contrast to one of the major features of S. marcescens. Persistent Serratia sink strains are identical to those involved in clonal and polyclonal outbreaks of VIM-1 and OXA-48 producers since at least 2017. The 'source-sink' dynamics of SMC populations able to acquire the highly conserved plasmids such as IncL carrying blaVIM-1 or blaOXA-48 offer novel insights that might improve interventions to control outbreaks and treat Serratia infections in high-risk hospital areas.\nTransertion and cell geometry organize the Escherichia coli nucleoid during rapid growth\nAuthors: Spahn, C.; Middlemiss, S.; Gomez-de-Mariscal, E.; Henriques, R.; Bode, H. B.; Holden, S.; Heilemann, M.\nScore: 25.2, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562172\nUsing 3D single-molecule localization microscopy and live-cell imaging, we show that the Escherichia coli nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-associated configuration during rapid growth. To study the influence of different biosynthetic processes on nucleoid morphology and positioning, we recorded multi-colour super-resolution images during drug treatment. After developing analysis routines for confocal and super-resolution images, we captured highly resolved snapshots which revealed the complete loss of the membrane-bound state of the nucleoid within 10 minutes of halting transcription and translation. This indicates an active role of transertion (coupled transcription, translation and membrane insertion) in nucleoid organization. In contrast, cell wall synthesis inhibition only affects nucleoid organization during morphological changes. Further, we provide evidence that the E. coli nucleoid spatially correlates with MreB in unperturbed E. coli cells, while this correlation diminishes in cells with changed cell geometry or upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Replication inhibition experiments, as well as multi-drug treatments highlight the role of entropic effects and transcription in nucleoid condensation and positioning. In summary, we provide experimental evidence for transertion as a principal organiser of the bacterial nucleoid, and show that an altered metabolic state and antibiotic treatment both lead to major changes in the degree of transertion and overall spatial organization of the nucleoid. Our high-resolution characterization reveals dynamics of antibiotic action and provides tools to quantify bacterial chromosome organization. This does not provide valuable insights into the role of transertion, but can also be applied to study other cell-biological processes.\nWidespread prevalence of a post-translational modification in activation of an essential bacterial DNA damage response\nAuthors: Kamat, A.; Tran, N.; Sharda, M.; Sontakke, N.; Le, T. B.; Badrinarayanan, A.\nScore: 25.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561495\nDNA methylation plays central roles in diverse cellular processes, ranging from error-correction during replication to regulation of bacterial defense mechanisms. Nevertheless, certain aberrant methylation modifications can have lethal consequences. The mechanisms by which bacteria detect and respond to such damage remain incompletely understood. Here, we discover a highly conserved but previously uncharacterized transcription factor (Cada2), which orchestrates a methylation-dependent adaptive response in Caulobacter. This response operates independently of the SOS response, governs the expression of genes crucial for direct repair, and is essential for surviving methylation-induced damage. Our molecular investigation of Cada2 reveals a cysteine methylation-dependent post-translational modification and mode of action distinct from its E. coli counterpart, a trait conserved across all bacteria harboring a Cada2-like homolog instead. Extending across the bacterial kingdom, our findings support the notion of divergence and co-evolution of adaptive response transcription factors and their corresponding sequence-specific DNA motifs. Despite this diversity, the ubiquitous prevalence of adaptive response regulators underscores the significance of a transcriptional switch, mediated by methylation post-translational modification, in driving a specific and essential bacterial DNA damage response.\nCultivating efficiency: High-throughput growth analysis of anaerobic bacteria in compact microplate readers.\nAuthors: Snoeyenbos-West, O. L. O.; Guerrero, C. R.; Valencia, M.; Carini, P.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561742\nAnaerobic microbes play crucial roles in environmental processes, industry, and human health. Traditional methods for monitoring the growth of anaerobes, including plate counts or subsampling broth cultures for optical density measurements, are time and resource intensive. The advent of microplate readers revolutionized bacterial growth studies by enabling high-throughput and real-time monitoring of microbial growth kinetics but their use in anaerobic microbiology has remained limited. Here, we present a workflow for using small-footprint microplate readers and the Growthcurver R package to analyze the kinetic growth metrics of anaerobic bacteria. We benchmarked the small-footprint Cerillo Stratus microplate reader against a BioTek Synergy HTX microplate reader in aerobic conditions using Escherichia coli DSM 28618 cultures. The growth rates and carrying capacities obtained from the two readers were statistically indistinguishable. However, the area under the logistic curve was significantly higher in cultures monitored by the Stratus reader. We used the Stratus to quantify the growth responses of anaerobically grown E. coli and Clostridium bolteae DSM 29485 to different doses of the toxin sodium arsenite. The growth of E. coli and C. bolteae was sensitive to arsenite doses of 1.3 M and 0.4 M, respectively. Complete inhibition of growth was achieved at 38 M arsenite for C. bolteae, and 338 M in E. coli. These results show that the Stratus performs similarly to a leading brand of microplate reader and can be reliably used in anaerobic conditions. We discuss the advantages of the small format microplate readers and our experiences with the Stratus. Importance statementWe present a workflow that facilitates the production and analysis of growth curves for anaerobic microbes using small-footprint microplate readers and an R script. This workflow is a cost and space-effective solution to most high-throughput solutions for collecting growth data from anaerobic microbes. This technology can be used for applications in which high-throughput would advance discovery, including microbial isolation, bioprospecting, co-culturing, host-microbe interactions, and drug/toxin-microbial interactions.\nA comparison of short-read, HiFi long-read, and hybrid strategies for genome-resolved metagenomics\nAuthors: Eisenhofer, R.; Nesme, J.; Santos-Bay, L.; Koziol, A.; Sorensen, S. J.; Alberdi, A.; Aizpurua, O.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560907\nShotgun metagenomics enables the reconstruction of complex microbial communities at a high level of detail. Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 faecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read + 20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics, but instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies, and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes. The most optimal strategy is study-specific, and depends on how researchers assess the tradeoff between the quantity and quality of recovered genomes. ImportanceOur understanding of microbial communities is limited by the technologies we employ. Here, we test several different DNA sequencing techniques to better understand the pros and cons of each. Long read DNA sequencing allowed for the reconstruction of higher quality and even complete microbial genomes, however, the cost was greater than commonly used short-read DNA sequencing. We suggest researchers consider the trade-offs between each method and decide based on the goals of their research question/s.\nAminoglycoside heteroresistance in Enterobacter cloacae is driven by the cell envelope stress response.\nAuthors: Choi, A. J.; Bennison, D. J.; Kulkarni, E.; Sun, H.; Li, H.; Bradshaw, J.; Yeap, H. W.; Lim, N.; Mishra, V.; Crespo-Puig, A.; Davies, F.; Sriskandan, S.; Shenoy, A. R.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561937\nEnterobacter cloacae is a Gram-negative nosocomial pathogen of the ESKAPE priority group with increasing multi-drug resistance via the acquisition of resistance plasmids. However, E. cloacae can also display phenotypic antimicrobial resistance, such as heteroresistance or persistence. Here we report that E. cloacae ATCC 13047 and six strains isolated from patients with blood infections display heteroresistance or persistence to aminoglycosides. E. cloacae heteroresistance is transient, accompanied with formation of \"petite\" colonies and increased MIC against gentamicin and other aminoglycosides used in the clinic, but not other antibiotic classes. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing of heteroresistant bacteria, which revealed global gene-expression changes and a signature of the CpxRA cell envelope stress response. Deletion of the cpxRA two-component system abrogated aminoglycoside heteroresistance and petite colony formation, pointing to its indispensable role in phenotypic resistance. The introduction of a constitutively active allele of cpxA led to high aminoglycoside MICs, consistent with cell envelope stress driving these behaviours in E. cloacae. Cell envelope stress can be caused by environmental cues, including heavy metals. Indeed, bacterial exposure to copper increased gentamicin MIC in the wild type, but not the {Delta}cpxRA mutant. Moreover, copper exposure also elevated the gentamicin MICs of bloodstream isolates, suggesting that CpxRA- and copper-dependent aminoglycoside resistance is broadly conserved in E. cloacae strains. Altogether, we establish that E. cloacae relies on transcriptional reprogramming via the envelope stress response pathway for transient resistance to a major class of frontline antibiotic.\nAustralian terrestrial environments harbour extensive RNA virus diversity\nAuthors: Sadiq, S.; Harvey, E.; Mifsud, J. C.; Minasny, B.; McBratney, A. B.; Pozza, L. E.; Mahar, J. E.; Holmes, E. C.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561620\nAustralia is home to a diverse range of unique native fauna and flora. To address whether Australian ecosystems also harbour unique viruses, we performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of 16 farmland and sediment samples taken from the east and west coasts of Australia. We identified 2,562 putatively novel viruses across 15 orders, the vast majority of which belonged to the microbe-associated phylum Lenarviricota. In many orders, the novel viruses identified here comprised entirely new clades, such as the Nodamuvirales and Ghabrivirales. Novel viruses also fell between established genera or families, such as in the Cystoviridae and Picornavirales, while highly divergent lineages were identified in the Martellivirales and Ghabrivirales. Viral abundance and alpha diversity were influenced by sampling site, soil type and land use, but not by depth from the surface. In sum, Australian soils and sediments are home to remarkable viral diversity, reflecting the biodiversity of local fauna and flora.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the factors that shape variation in the human microbiome is a major goal of research in biology. While other genomics fields have used large, pre-compiled compendia to extract systematic insights requiring otherwise impractical sample sizes, there has been no comparable resource for the 16S rRNA sequencing data commonly used to quantify microbiome composition. To help close this gap, we have assembled a set of 168,484 publicly available human gut microbiome samples, processed with a single pipeline and combined into the largest unified microbiome dataset to date. We use this resource, which is freely available at microbiomap.org, to shed light on global variation in the human gut microbiome. We find that Firmicutes, particularly Bacilli and Clostridia, are almost universally present in the human gut. At the same time, the relative abundance of the 65 most common microbial genera differ between at least two world regions. We also show that gut microbiomes in undersampled world regions, such as Central and Southern Asia, differ significantly from the more thoroughly characterized microbiomes of Europe and Northern America. Moreover, humans in these overlooked regions likely harbor hundreds of taxa that have not yet been discovered due to this undersampling, highlighting the need for diversity in microbiome studies. We anticipate that this new compendium can serve the community and enable advanced applied and methodological research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Escherichia coli is a major human pathogen and the most widely studied microbe in history, but its extrachromosomal elements known as plasmids remain poorly delineated. Here we used long-read technology to high-resolution sequence the entire plasmidome and the corresponding host chromosomes from a longitudinal survey covering two decades and over 2,000 E. coli isolates. Separation of chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA enabled us to reconstruct co-evolutionary trajectories of host lineages and their plasmids on a population-wide scale, demonstrating that plasmid evolution is markedly constrained contrary to the established dogma. We find that some plasmids have persisted in lineages for centuries, and provide a high-resolution map of recent vertical and horizontal evolutionary events in plasmids with key antibiotic resistance, competition and virulence determinants. We present genomic evidence of both chromosomal and plasmid-driven success strategies that represent convergent phenotypic evolution in distant lineages, and use in vitro experiments to verify the importance of bacteriocin-producing plasmids for clone success. Our study has general implications for understanding plasmid biology and bacterial evolutionary strategies, and informing development of future interventions against pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Members of Agrobacterium are costly plant pathogens while also essential tools for plant transformation. Though Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) has been heavily studied, its polygenic nature and its complex transcriptional regulation make identifying the genetic basis of transformational efficiency difficult through traditional genetic and bioinformatic approaches. Here we use a bottom-up synthetic approach to systematically refactor the tumor-inducing plasmid, wherein the majority of AMT machine components are encoded, into a minimal set of genes capable of plant and fungal transformation that is both controllable and orthogonal to its environment. We demonstrate that engineered vectors can be transferred to new heterologous bacteria, enabling them to transform plants. Our reductionist approach demonstrates how bottom-up engineering can be used to dissect and elucidate the genetic underpinnings of complex biological traits, and may lead to the development of strains of bacteria more capable of transforming recalcitrant plant species of societal importance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen historically associated with abrupt, unpredictable, and severe outbreaks in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and, more recently, with the spread of acquired genes encoding carbapenem resistance. However, the population biology and ecology of S. marcescens in the hospital ecosystem is still poorly understood. Here, we combine epidemiological information of 1417 Serratia isolates collected from the sinks of a large ICU ward that underwent significant demographic and operational changes (2019-2020) and 99 non-redundant outbreak/non-outbreak isolates from the same hospital (2003-2019), with genomic data of 165 isolates. We first report hospital sinks as reservoirs of heterogeneous and coexistent populations of the S. marcescens complex (SMC). A novel SMC clade congruent with the recently described Serratia nevei species is predominant, exhibiting chromosomal AmpC {beta}-lactamase with an unusual basal expression in contrast to one of the major features of S. marcescens. Persistent Serratia sink strains are identical to those involved in clonal and polyclonal outbreaks of VIM-1 and OXA-48 producers since at least 2017. The &#39;source-sink&#39; dynamics of SMC populations able to acquire the highly conserved plasmids such as IncL carrying blaVIM-1 or blaOXA-48 offer novel insights that might improve interventions to control outbreaks and treat Serratia infections in high-risk hospital areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Using 3D single-molecule localization microscopy and live-cell imaging, we show that the Escherichia coli nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-associated configuration during rapid growth. To study the influence of different biosynthetic processes on nucleoid morphology and positioning, we recorded multi-colour super-resolution images during drug treatment. After developing analysis routines for confocal and super-resolution images, we captured highly resolved snapshots which revealed the complete loss of the membrane-bound state of the nucleoid within 10 minutes of halting transcription and translation. This indicates an active role of transertion (coupled transcription, translation and membrane insertion) in nucleoid organization. In contrast, cell wall synthesis inhibition only affects nucleoid organization during morphological changes. Further, we provide evidence that the E. coli nucleoid spatially correlates with MreB in unperturbed E. coli cells, while this correlation diminishes in cells with changed cell geometry or upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Replication inhibition experiments, as well as multi-drug treatments highlight the role of entropic effects and transcription in nucleoid condensation and positioning. In summary, we provide experimental evidence for transertion as a principal organiser of the bacterial nucleoid, and show that an altered metabolic state and antibiotic treatment both lead to major changes in the degree of transertion and overall spatial organization of the nucleoid. Our high-resolution characterization reveals dynamics of antibiotic action and provides tools to quantify bacterial chromosome organization. This does not provide valuable insights into the role of transertion, but can also be applied to study other cell-biological processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA methylation plays central roles in diverse cellular processes, ranging from error-correction during replication to regulation of bacterial defense mechanisms. Nevertheless, certain aberrant methylation modifications can have lethal consequences. The mechanisms by which bacteria detect and respond to such damage remain incompletely understood. Here, we discover a highly conserved but previously uncharacterized transcription factor (Cada2), which orchestrates a methylation-dependent adaptive response in Caulobacter. This response operates independently of the SOS response, governs the expression of genes crucial for direct repair, and is essential for surviving methylation-induced damage. Our molecular investigation of Cada2 reveals a cysteine methylation-dependent post-translational modification and mode of action distinct from its E. coli counterpart, a trait conserved across all bacteria harboring a Cada2-like homolog instead. Extending across the bacterial kingdom, our findings support the notion of divergence and co-evolution of adaptive response transcription factors and their corresponding sequence-specific DNA motifs. Despite this diversity, the ubiquitous prevalence of adaptive response regulators underscores the significance of a transcriptional switch, mediated by methylation post-translational modification, in driving a specific and essential bacterial DNA damage response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anaerobic microbes play crucial roles in environmental processes, industry, and human health. Traditional methods for monitoring the growth of anaerobes, including plate counts or subsampling broth cultures for optical density measurements, are time and resource intensive. The advent of microplate readers revolutionized bacterial growth studies by enabling high-throughput and real-time monitoring of microbial growth kinetics but their use in anaerobic microbiology has remained limited. Here, we present a workflow for using small-footprint microplate readers and the Growthcurver R package to analyze the kinetic growth metrics of anaerobic bacteria. We benchmarked the small-footprint Cerillo Stratus microplate reader against a BioTek Synergy HTX microplate reader in aerobic conditions using Escherichia coli DSM 28618 cultures. The growth rates and carrying capacities obtained from the two readers were statistically indistinguishable. However, the area under the logistic curve was significantly higher in cultures monitored by the Stratus reader. We used the Stratus to quantify the growth responses of anaerobically grown E. coli and Clostridium bolteae DSM 29485 to different doses of the toxin sodium arsenite. The growth of E. coli and C. bolteae was sensitive to arsenite doses of 1.3 M and 0.4 M, respectively. Complete inhibition of growth was achieved at 38 M arsenite for C. bolteae, and 338 M in E. coli. These results show that the Stratus performs similarly to a leading brand of microplate reader and can be reliably used in anaerobic conditions. We discuss the advantages of the small format microplate readers and our experiences with the Stratus.

Importance statementWe present a workflow that facilitates the production and analysis of growth curves for anaerobic microbes using small-footprint microplate readers and an R script. This workflow is a cost and space-effective solution to most high-throughput solutions for collecting growth data from anaerobic microbes. This technology can be used for applications in which high-throughput would advance discovery, including microbial isolation, bioprospecting, co-culturing, host-microbe interactions, and drug/toxin-microbial interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Shotgun metagenomics enables the reconstruction of complex microbial communities at a high level of detail. Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 faecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read &#43; 20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics, but instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies, and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes. The most optimal strategy is study-specific, and depends on how researchers assess the tradeoff between the quantity and quality of recovered genomes.

ImportanceOur understanding of microbial communities is limited by the technologies we employ. Here, we test several different DNA sequencing techniques to better understand the pros and cons of each. Long read DNA sequencing allowed for the reconstruction of higher quality and even complete microbial genomes, however, the cost was greater than commonly used short-read DNA sequencing. We suggest researchers consider the trade-offs between each method and decide based on the goals of their research question/s.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enterobacter cloacae is a Gram-negative nosocomial pathogen of the ESKAPE priority group with increasing multi-drug resistance via the acquisition of resistance plasmids. However, E. cloacae can also display phenotypic antimicrobial resistance, such as heteroresistance or persistence. Here we report that E. cloacae ATCC 13047 and six strains isolated from patients with blood infections display heteroresistance or persistence to aminoglycosides. E. cloacae heteroresistance is transient, accompanied with formation of &#34;petite&#34; colonies and increased MIC against gentamicin and other aminoglycosides used in the clinic, but not other antibiotic classes. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing of heteroresistant bacteria, which revealed global gene-expression changes and a signature of the CpxRA cell envelope stress response. Deletion of the cpxRA two-component system abrogated aminoglycoside heteroresistance and petite colony formation, pointing to its indispensable role in phenotypic resistance. The introduction of a constitutively active allele of cpxA led to high aminoglycoside MICs, consistent with cell envelope stress driving these behaviours in E. cloacae. Cell envelope stress can be caused by environmental cues, including heavy metals. Indeed, bacterial exposure to copper increased gentamicin MIC in the wild type, but not the {Delta}cpxRA mutant. Moreover, copper exposure also elevated the gentamicin MICs of bloodstream isolates, suggesting that CpxRA- and copper-dependent aminoglycoside resistance is broadly conserved in E. cloacae strains. Altogether, we establish that E. cloacae relies on transcriptional reprogramming via the envelope stress response pathway for transient resistance to a major class of frontline antibiotic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Australia is home to a diverse range of unique native fauna and flora. To address whether Australian ecosystems also harbour unique viruses, we performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of 16 farmland and sediment samples taken from the east and west coasts of Australia. We identified 2,562 putatively novel viruses across 15 orders, the vast majority of which belonged to the microbe-associated phylum Lenarviricota. In many orders, the novel viruses identified here comprised entirely new clades, such as the Nodamuvirales and Ghabrivirales. Novel viruses also fell between established genera or families, such as in the Cystoviridae and Picornavirales, while highly divergent lineages were identified in the Martellivirales and Ghabrivirales. Viral abundance and alpha diversity were influenced by sampling site, soil type and land use, but not by depth from the surface. In sum, Australian soils and sediments are home to remarkable viral diversity, reflecting the biodiversity of local fauna and flora.</p>
