P.\nScore: 333.6, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564608\nRecent analysis of data from the Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer confirm geochemical modeling work that shows that the ocean of Enceladus contains considerable quantities of inorganic phosphorus as well as ammonium [55]. Technological advancement in flight instrumentation will continue to yield increasingly detailed data about the relative elemental and molecular composition of life detection candidates. Apart from speculating about threshold concentrations of bioactive compounds to support ecosystems, metabolic and ecological theory can provide a powerful interpretative lens to assess whether extraterrestrial environments are compatible with living ecosystems. Using multiple levels of ecological analysis, spanning from assuming strictly Earth-like organismal physiology to more agnostic understandings of putative biochemistries, we compare the proposed N:P stoichiometries of the Enceledus ocean to possible ecologies. We use chemostat models to predict potentially supportable biomass concentrations under different energy and matter flux regimes, macromolecular allometric theory to compare hypothetical biomass N:P ratios to possible environmental N:P supply ratios, and finally take a data-driven biogeochemical approach to predict possible biomass N:P ratios from the observed dissolved ratios. All three of our modeling approaches suggest marginal compatibility of an ecosystem with the ranges of dissolved N and P concentrations in the Enceledean ocean. Based on our analysis, we suggest two main priorities for further research into terrestrial analogs to improve our ability to interpret geochemical ratios as a life detection instrument.\nEmergence and spread of feline infectious peritonitis due to a highly pathogenic canine/feline recombinant coronavirus\nAuthors: Atippa, C.; Warr, A. S.; Epaminondas, D.; O'Shea, M.; Fletcher, S. L.; Malbon, A.; Lyraki, M.; Hammond, R.; Hardas, A.; Zanti, A.; Loukaidou, S.; Gentil, M.; Gunn-Moore, D.; Mazeri, S.; Tait-Burkard, C.\nScore: 102.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566182\nCross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1-3. Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed and demonstrated4-7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The recombination, spanning spike, shows 97% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus CB/05. Infection is spreading fast and infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears rapid and likely non-reliant on biotype switch12. High sequence identity of isolates from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A deletion and several amino acid changes in spike, particularly the receptor binding domain, compared to other FCoV-2s, indicate changes to receptor binding and likely cell tropism.\nAn acidophilic fungus is integral to prey digestion in a carnivorous plant\nAuthors: Sun, P.-F.; Lu, M. R.; Liu, Y.-C.; Lin, Y.-f.; Hoh, D. Z.; Ke, H.-M.; Wang, I.-F.; Lu, M.-Y. J.; Kirschner, R.; Lin, Y.-C. J.; Chen, Y.-L.; Tsai, I. J.\nScore: 84.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566145\nCarnivorous plant leaves, such as those of the spoon-leaved sundew Drosera spatulata, secrete mucilage which hosts microorganisms potentially aiding in prey digestion. We characterised the mucilage microbial communities and identified the acidophilic fungus Acrodontium crateriforme as the ecologically dominant species. The fungus grows and sporulates on sundew glands as its preferred acidic environment. We show that the A. crateriforme has a reduced genome similar to that of other symbiotic fungi. Based on the transcriptomes when encountering prey insects, we revealed a high degree of genes co-option in each species during fungus-plant coexistence and digestion. Expression patterns of the holobiont during digestion further revealed synergistic effects in several gene families including fungal aspartic and sedolisin peptidases, facilitating the digestion of sundews prey, as well as transporters and dose-dependent responses in plant genes involved in jasmonate signalling pathway. This study establishes that botanical carnivory is defined by multidimensional adaptations correlated with interspecies interactions.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-variant BA.2.86 is attenuated in hamsters\nAuthors: Herder, V.; Mendonca, D. C.; Upfold, N.; Furnon, W.; Kerr, K.; Ilia, G.; Allan, J.; Sigal, A.; Patel, A. H.; Palmarini, M.\nScore: 56.0, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566576\nSARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to risk-assess newly emerged variants in near \"real-time\" to estimate their potential threat to public health. The recently emerged Omicron sub-variant BA.2.86 raised concerns as it carries a high number of mutations compared to its predecessors. Here, we assessed the virulence of BA.2.86 in hamsters. We compared the pathogenesis of BA.2.86 and BA.2.75, as the latter is one of the most virulent Omicron sub-variants in this animal model. Using digital pathology pipelines, we quantified the extent of pulmonary lesions measuring T cell and macrophage infiltrates, in addition to alveolar epithelial hyperplasia. We also assessed body weight loss, clinical symptoms, virus load in oropharyngeal swabs, and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Our data show that BA.2.86 displays an attenuated phenotype in hamsters, suggesting that it poses no greater risk to public health than its parental Omicron sub-variants. Article summary lineThe newly emerged Omicron sub-variant BA.2.86 is attenuated in hamsters.\nDiscovery and characterization of the first known biological lanthanide chelator\nAuthors: Zytnick, A. M.; Gutenthaler, S. M.; Aron, A. T.; Reitz, Z. L.; Phi, M. T.; Good, N. M.; Petras, D.; Daumann, L. J.; Martinez-Gomez, N. C.\nScore: 60.7, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2022.01.19.476857\nMany bacteria secrete metallophores, low-molecular weight organic compounds that bind ions with high selectivity and affinity, in order to access essential metals from the environment.1 Previous work has elucidated the structures and biosynthetic machinery of metallophores specific for iron, zinc, nickel, molybdenum, and copper.1 No lanthanide-specific metallophore has been discovered despite the knowledge that lanthanide metals (Ln) have been revealed to be essential cofactors for certain alcohol dehydrogenases across a diverse range of phyla.2 Here, we report the biosynthetic machinery, the structure, and the physiological relevance of the first known lanthanophore, methylolanthanin. The structure of methylolanthanin exhibits a unique 4-hydroxybenzoate moiety which has not previously been described in other metallophores. We find that production of methylolanthanin is required for normal levels of Ln accumulation in the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, while overexpression of the molecule greatly increases bioaccumulation. Our results provide a clearer understanding of how Ln-utilizing bacteria sense, scavenge, and store Ln; essential processes in the environment where Ln are poorly bioavailable. Beyond Ln, we anticipate our study to be a starting point for understanding how organisms acquire other f-block metals, the actinides.3 More broadly, the discovery of a lanthanophore opens doors for study of how biosynthetic gene clusters are repurposed for new functions, how metallophores acquire their metal specificity, and the complex relationship between metal homeostasis and fitness.\nSensory kinase KdpD is a tandem serine histidine kinase controlling K+ pump KdpFABC on the translational and post-transcriptional level\nAuthors: Silberberg, J. M.; Ketter, S.; Boehm, P. J.; Jordan, K.; Wittenberg, M.; Grass, J.; Haenelt, I.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566405\nTwo-component systems (TCSs), consisting of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator, serve signal transduction in bacteria, often regulating transcription in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we identify a tandem serine histidine kinase function for KdpD, previously described as a HK of the TCS KdpDE, which controls production of the K+ pump KdpFABC. We show that KdpD additionally mediates an inhibitory serine phosphorylation of KdpFABC at high K+ levels, using not its C-terminal HK domain but an N-terminal atypical serine kinase (ASK) domain. Sequence analysis of KdpDs from different species highlights that some KdpDs comprise solely ASK and Usp domains. We show that, while Escherichia coli KdpDs ASK responds directly to K+ levels, a shorter version from Deinococcus geothermalis is controlled by second messenger cyclic di-AMP. Our findings add to the growing functional diversity of sensor kinases while simultaneously expanding the framework for regulatory mechanisms in bacterial K+ homeostasis.\nThe Parkinson's drug entacapone disrupts gut microbiome homeostasis via iron sequestration\nAuthors: Pereira, F. C.; Ge, X.; Kristensen, J. M.; Kirkegaard, R. H.; Maritsch, K.; Zu, Y.; Decorte, M.; Hausmann, B.; Berry, D.; Wasmund, K.; Schintlmeister, A.; Boettcher, T.; Cheng, J.-X.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566429\nIncreasing evidence shows that many human-targeted drugs alter the gut microbiome, leading to implications for host health. However, much less is known about the mechanisms by which drugs target the microbiome and how drugs affect microbial function. Here we combined quantitative microbiome profiling, long-read metagenomics, stable isotope probing and single-cell chemical imaging to investigate the impact of two widely prescribed nervous system-targeted drugs on the gut microbiome. Ex vivo supplementation of physiologically relevant concentrations of entacapone or loxapine succinate to faecal samples significantly impacted the abundance of up to one third of the microbial species present. Importantly, we demonstrate that the impact of these drugs on microbial metabolism is much more pronounced than their impact on abundances, with low concentrations of drugs reducing the activity, but not the abundance of key microbiome members like Bacteroides, Ruminococcus or Clostridium species. We further demonstrate that entacapone impacts the microbiome due to its ability to complex and deplete available iron, and that microbial growth can be rescued by replenishing levels of microbiota-accessible iron. Remarkably, entacapone-induced iron starvation selected for iron-scavenging organisms carrying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Collectively, our study unveils the impact of two under-investigated drugs on whole microbiomes and identifies metal sequestration as a mechanism of drug-induced microbiome disturbance.\nA CRISPR interference system for the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii\nAuthors: Russell, S. J.; Garcia, A. K.; Kacar, B.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.565814\nA grand challenge for the next century can be found in mitigating the effects of changing climate through bioengineering solutions. Biological nitrogen fixation, the globally consequential, nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to bioavailable ammonia, is a particularly vital area of focus. Nitrogen fixation engineering relies upon extensive understanding of underlying genetics in microbial models, including the broadly utilized gammaproteobacterium, Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii). Here we report the first CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for targeted gene silencing in A. vinelandii that integrates genomically via site-specific transposon insertion. We demonstrate that CRISPRi can repress transcription of an essential nitrogen fixation gene by [~]60%. Further, we show that nitrogenase genes are suitably expressed from the transposon insertion site, indicating that CRISPRi and engineered nitrogen fixation genes can be co-integrated for combinatorial studies of gene expression and engineering. Our established CRISPRi system extends the utility of A. vinelandii and will aid efforts to engineer microbial nitrogen fixation for desired purposes.

T.; Le, T. B. K.\nScore: 17.3, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.565669\nGene Transfer Agents (GTAs) are domesticated prophages that cannot self-multiply and be infectious but might have been co-opted to perform biological functions for the host bacteria. Recently, Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium best known as a model organism to study bacterial cell biology and cell cycle regulation, has been demonstrated to produce bona fide GTA particles (CcGTA). Two direct activators of the CcGTA biosynthetic gene cluster, GafY and GafZ, have been identified, however, it is unknown how GafYZ controls transcription mechanistically or how they coordinate gene expression of the CcGTA gene cluster with other accessory genes elsewhere on the genome for CcGTA production. Here, we show that the CcGTA gene cluster is transcriptionally co-activated by GafY, integration host factor (IHF), and by GafZ-mediated transcription anti-termination. We present evidence that GafZ is a novel transcription anti-terminator that likely forms an anti-termination complex with RNA polymerase, NusA, NusG, and NusE to bypass transcription terminators within the 14 kb CcGTA cluster. Overall, we reveal a two-tier regulation that coordinates the synthesis of GTA particles in C. crescentus.\nKeeping FIT: Iron-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in Toxoplasma gondii\nAuthors: Sloan, M. A.; Scott, A. L.; Harding, C. R.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.565792\nIron is required to support almost all life; however, levels must be carefully regulated to maintain homeostasis. Although the obligate parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires iron, how it responds when iron becomes limiting has not been investigated. Here, we show that iron depletion triggers significant transcriptional changes in the parasite, including in pathways that require iron. Interestingly, we find that a subset of T. gondii transcripts contain stem-loop structures which have been associated with post-transcriptional iron-mediated regulation in other cellular systems. We validate one of these (found in the 3 UTR of TGME49_261720) using a reporter cell line. We show that the presence of the stem-loop containing UTR is sufficient to confer accumulation at the transcript and protein levels under low iron. We show that this response is dose and time-dependent and is specific for iron. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase is capable of binding to mRNA, including fit, and that the presence of the fit UTR leads to stabilisation of the transcript under low iron conditions. These results demonstrate the existence of iron-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in Toxoplasma for the first time, and show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase may have an additional role as an RNA-binding protein.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent analysis of data from the Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer confirm geochemical modeling work that shows that the ocean of Enceladus contains considerable quantities of inorganic phosphorus as well as ammonium [55]. Technological advancement in flight instrumentation will continue to yield increasingly detailed data about the relative elemental and molecular composition of life detection candidates. Apart from speculating about threshold concentrations of bioactive compounds to support ecosystems, metabolic and ecological theory can provide a powerful interpretative lens to assess whether extraterrestrial environments are compatible with living ecosystems. Using multiple levels of ecological analysis, spanning from assuming strictly Earth-like organismal physiology to more agnostic understandings of putative biochemistries, we compare the proposed N:P stoichiometries of the Enceledus ocean to possible ecologies. We use chemostat models to predict potentially supportable biomass concentrations under different energy and matter flux regimes, macromolecular allometric theory to compare hypothetical biomass N:P ratios to possible environmental N:P supply ratios, and finally take a data-driven biogeochemical approach to predict possible biomass N:P ratios from the observed dissolved ratios. All three of our modeling approaches suggest marginal compatibility of an ecosystem with the ranges of dissolved N and P concentrations in the Enceledean ocean. Based on our analysis, we suggest two main priorities for further research into terrestrial analogs to improve our ability to interpret geochemical ratios as a life detection instrument.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1-3. Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed and demonstrated4-7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The recombination, spanning spike, shows 97% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus CB/05. Infection is spreading fast and infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears rapid and likely non-reliant on biotype switch12. High sequence identity of isolates from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A deletion and several amino acid changes in spike, particularly the receptor binding domain, compared to other FCoV-2s, indicate changes to receptor binding and likely cell tropism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Carnivorous plant leaves, such as those of the spoon-leaved sundew Drosera spatulata, secrete mucilage which hosts microorganisms potentially aiding in prey digestion. We characterised the mucilage microbial communities and identified the acidophilic fungus Acrodontium crateriforme as the ecologically dominant species. The fungus grows and sporulates on sundew glands as its preferred acidic environment. We show that the A. crateriforme has a reduced genome similar to that of other symbiotic fungi. Based on the transcriptomes when encountering prey insects, we revealed a high degree of genes co-option in each species during fungus-plant coexistence and digestion. Expression patterns of the holobiont during digestion further revealed synergistic effects in several gene families including fungal aspartic and sedolisin peptidases, facilitating the digestion of sundews prey, as well as transporters and dose-dependent responses in plant genes involved in jasmonate signalling pathway. This study establishes that botanical carnivory is defined by multidimensional adaptations correlated with interspecies interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to risk-assess newly emerged variants in near &#34;real-time&#34; to estimate their potential threat to public health. The recently emerged Omicron sub-variant BA.2.86 raised concerns as it carries a high number of mutations compared to its predecessors. Here, we assessed the virulence of BA.2.86 in hamsters. We compared the pathogenesis of BA.2.86 and BA.2.75, as the latter is one of the most virulent Omicron sub-variants in this animal model. Using digital pathology pipelines, we quantified the extent of pulmonary lesions measuring T cell and macrophage infiltrates, in addition to alveolar epithelial hyperplasia. We also assessed body weight loss, clinical symptoms, virus load in oropharyngeal swabs, and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Our data show that BA.2.86 displays an attenuated phenotype in hamsters, suggesting that it poses no greater risk to public health than its parental Omicron sub-variants.

        <p class="abstract">Many bacteria secrete metallophores, low-molecular weight organic compounds that bind ions with high selectivity and affinity, in order to access essential metals from the environment.1 Previous work has elucidated the structures and biosynthetic machinery of metallophores specific for iron, zinc, nickel, molybdenum, and copper.1 No lanthanide-specific metallophore has been discovered despite the knowledge that lanthanide metals (Ln) have been revealed to be essential cofactors for certain alcohol dehydrogenases across a diverse range of phyla.2 Here, we report the biosynthetic machinery, the structure, and the physiological relevance of the first known lanthanophore, methylolanthanin. The structure of methylolanthanin exhibits a unique 4-hydroxybenzoate moiety which has not previously been described in other metallophores. We find that production of methylolanthanin is required for normal levels of Ln accumulation in the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, while overexpression of the molecule greatly increases bioaccumulation. Our results provide a clearer understanding of how Ln-utilizing bacteria sense, scavenge, and store Ln; essential processes in the environment where Ln are poorly bioavailable. Beyond Ln, we anticipate our study to be a starting point for understanding how organisms acquire other f-block metals, the actinides.3 More broadly, the discovery of a lanthanophore opens doors for study of how biosynthetic gene clusters are repurposed for new functions, how metallophores acquire their metal specificity, and the complex relationship between metal homeostasis and fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Two-component systems (TCSs), consisting of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator, serve signal transduction in bacteria, often regulating transcription in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we identify a tandem serine histidine kinase function for KdpD, previously described as a HK of the TCS KdpDE, which controls production of the K&#43; pump KdpFABC. We show that KdpD additionally mediates an inhibitory serine phosphorylation of KdpFABC at high K&#43; levels, using not its C-terminal HK domain but an N-terminal atypical serine kinase (ASK) domain. Sequence analysis of KdpDs from different species highlights that some KdpDs comprise solely ASK and Usp domains. We show that, while Escherichia coli KdpDs ASK responds directly to K&#43; levels, a shorter version from Deinococcus geothermalis is controlled by second messenger cyclic di-AMP. Our findings add to the growing functional diversity of sensor kinases while simultaneously expanding the framework for regulatory mechanisms in bacterial K&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increasing evidence shows that many human-targeted drugs alter the gut microbiome, leading to implications for host health. However, much less is known about the mechanisms by which drugs target the microbiome and how drugs affect microbial function. Here we combined quantitative microbiome profiling, long-read metagenomics, stable isotope probing and single-cell chemical imaging to investigate the impact of two widely prescribed nervous system-targeted drugs on the gut microbiome. Ex vivo supplementation of physiologically relevant concentrations of entacapone or loxapine succinate to faecal samples significantly impacted the abundance of up to one third of the microbial species present. Importantly, we demonstrate that the impact of these drugs on microbial metabolism is much more pronounced than their impact on abundances, with low concentrations of drugs reducing the activity, but not the abundance of key microbiome members like Bacteroides, Ruminococcus or Clostridium species. We further demonstrate that entacapone impacts the microbiome due to its ability to complex and deplete available iron, and that microbial growth can be rescued by replenishing levels of microbiota-accessible iron. Remarkably, entacapone-induced iron starvation selected for iron-scavenging organisms carrying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Collectively, our study unveils the impact of two under-investigated drugs on whole microbiomes and identifies metal sequestration as a mechanism of drug-induced microbiome disturbance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A grand challenge for the next century can be found in mitigating the effects of changing climate through bioengineering solutions. Biological nitrogen fixation, the globally consequential, nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to bioavailable ammonia, is a particularly vital area of focus. Nitrogen fixation engineering relies upon extensive understanding of underlying genetics in microbial models, including the broadly utilized gammaproteobacterium, Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii). Here we report the first CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for targeted gene silencing in A. vinelandii that integrates genomically via site-specific transposon insertion. We demonstrate that CRISPRi can repress transcription of an essential nitrogen fixation gene by [~]60%. Further, we show that nitrogenase genes are suitably expressed from the transposon insertion site, indicating that CRISPRi and engineered nitrogen fixation genes can be co-integrated for combinatorial studies of gene expression and engineering. Our established CRISPRi system extends the utility of A. vinelandii and will aid efforts to engineer microbial nitrogen fixation for desired purposes.

        <p class="abstract">Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) are domesticated prophages that cannot self-multiply and be infectious but might have been co-opted to perform biological functions for the host bacteria. Recently, Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium best known as a model organism to study bacterial cell biology and cell cycle regulation, has been demonstrated to produce bona fide GTA particles (CcGTA). Two direct activators of the CcGTA biosynthetic gene cluster, GafY and GafZ, have been identified, however, it is unknown how GafYZ controls transcription mechanistically or how they coordinate gene expression of the CcGTA gene cluster with other accessory genes elsewhere on the genome for CcGTA production. Here, we show that the CcGTA gene cluster is transcriptionally co-activated by GafY, integration host factor (IHF), and by GafZ-mediated transcription anti-termination. We present evidence that GafZ is a novel transcription anti-terminator that likely forms an anti-termination complex with RNA polymerase, NusA, NusG, and NusE to bypass transcription terminators within the 14 kb CcGTA cluster. Overall, we reveal a two-tier regulation that coordinates the synthesis of GTA particles in C. crescentus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Iron is required to support almost all life; however, levels must be carefully regulated to maintain homeostasis. Although the obligate parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires iron, how it responds when iron becomes limiting has not been investigated. Here, we show that iron depletion triggers significant transcriptional changes in the parasite, including in pathways that require iron. Interestingly, we find that a subset of T. gondii transcripts contain stem-loop structures which have been associated with post-transcriptional iron-mediated regulation in other cellular systems. We validate one of these (found in the 3 UTR of TGME49_261720) using a reporter cell line. We show that the presence of the stem-loop containing UTR is sufficient to confer accumulation at the transcript and protein levels under low iron. We show that this response is dose and time-dependent and is specific for iron. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase is capable of binding to mRNA, including fit, and that the presence of the fit UTR leads to stabilisation of the transcript under low iron conditions. These results demonstrate the existence of iron-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in Toxoplasma for the first time, and show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase may have an additional role as an RNA-binding protein.</p>
