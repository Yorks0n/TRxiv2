Biogenesis of the outer membrane requires the transport of phospholipids across the cell envelope. Recently, YhdP was implicated as a major protagonist in the transport of phospholipids from the inner membrane to the outer membrane however the molecular mechanism of YhdP mediated transport remains elusive. Here, utilising AlphaFold, we observe YhdP to form an elongated assembly of 60 {beta} strands that curve to form a continuous hydrophobic groove. This architecture is consistent with our negative stain electron microscopy data which reveals YhdP to be approximately 250 [A] in length and thus sufficient to span the bacterial cell envelope. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo bacterial growth assays indicate essential helical regions at the N- and C-termini of YhdP, that may embed into the inner and outer membranes respectively, reinforcing its envelope spanning nature. Our in vivo crosslinking data reveal phosphate-containing substrates captured along the length of the YhdP groove, providing direct evidence that YhdP transports phospholipids. This finding is congruent with our molecular dynamics simulations which demonstrate the propensity for inner membrane lipids to spontaneously enter the groove of YhdP. Collectively, our results support a model in which YhdP bridges the cell envelope, providing a hydrophobic environment for the transport of phospholipids to the outer membrane.\nVirological characteristics correlating with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fusogenicity\nAuthors: Begum, M. M.; Ichihara, K.; Takahashi, O.; Nasser, H.; Jonathan, M.; Tokunaga, K.; Yoshida, I.; Nagashima, M.; Sadamasu, K.; Yoshimura, K.; Sato, K.; Ikeda, T.\nScore: 39.9, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560628\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein is essential in mediating membrane fusion of the virus with the target cells. Several reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein fusogenicity is reportedly closely associated with the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus determined using hamster models. However, the association between S protein fusogenicity and other virological parameters remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the virological parameters of eleven previous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) correlating with S protein fusogenicity. S protein fusogenicity was found to be strongly correlated with S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size formed by clinical isolates. However, S protein fusogenicity was less associated with pseudoviral infectivity, pseudovirus entry efficiency, and viral replication kinetics. Taken together, our results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size could be potential indicators to predict the intrinsic pathogenicity of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nBacterial cell surface nanoenvironment requires a specialized chaperone to activate a peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme\nAuthors: Delerue, T.; Chareyre, S.; Anantharaman, V.; Gilmore, M. C.; Popham, D. L.; Cava, f.; Aravind, L.; Ramamurthi, K. S.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561273\nBacillus subtilis spores are produced inside the cytosol of a mother cell. Spore surface assembly requires the SpoVK protein in the mother cell, but its function is unknown. Here, we report that SpoVK is a dedicated chaperone from a distinct higher-order clade of AAA+ ATPases that activates the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase MurG during sporulation, even though MurG does not normally require activation by a chaperone during vegetative growth. MurG redeploys to the spore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment necessitates a specific chaperone for proper MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly inactivates SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes other dedicated chaperones involved in secretion, cell-envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.\nEstablishment and comparative genomics of a high-quality collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates -- MosAIC (Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection)\nAuthors: Foo, A.; Brettell, L.

L.; Heinz, E.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560816\nMosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like dengue virus and parasites such as Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection (MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the Enterobacteriaceae comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of three genera, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Elizabethkingia, reveal lineages of mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in multiple laboratories. Investigation into species pangenomes further reveals clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future work to identify functions underlying mosquito host association. Altogether, we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly valuable resource to investigate factors for bacterial colonisation and adaptation within mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.\nThe cytoplasmic phosphate level has a central regulatory role in the phosphate starvation response of Caulobacter crescentus\nAuthors: Billini, M.; Hoffmann, T.; Kuhn, J.; Bremer, E.; Thanbichler, M.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561339\nIn bacteria, the availability of environmental inorganic phosphate is typically sensed by the conserved PhoR-PhoB two-component signal transduction pathway, which is thought to use the flux through the PstSCAB phosphate transporter as a readout of the extracellular phosphate level to control phosphate-responsive genes. While the sensing of environmental phosphate is well-investigated, the regulatory effects of cytoplasmic phosphate are unclear. Here, we disentangle the physiological and transcriptional responses of Caulobacter crescentus to changes in the environmental and cytoplasmic phosphate levels by uncoupling phosphate uptake from the activity of the PstSCAB system, using an additional, heterologously produced phosphate transporter. This approach reveals a two-pronged response of C. crescentus to phosphate limitation, in which PhoR-PhoB signaling mostly facilitates the utilization of alternative phosphate sources, whereas the cytoplasmic phosphate level controls the morphological and physiological adaptation of cells to growth under global phosphate limitation. These findings open the door to a comprehensive understanding of phosphate signaling in bacteria.\nSARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3 downregulation causes pneumonia\nAuthors: Luo, Y.-W.; Zhou, J.-P.; Ji, H.; Zheng, A.; Wang, X.; Dai, Z.; Luo, Z.; Cao, F.; Wang, X.-Y.; Bai, Y.; Chen, D.; Chen, Y.; Wang, Q.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Chiu, S.; Huang, A.-L.; Tang, K.-F.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560426\nAge is a major risk factor for coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated severe pneumonia and mortality; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we investigated whether age-related deregulation of RNAi components and RNA splicing factors affects COVID-19 severity. Decreased expression of RNAi components (Dicer and XPO5) and splicing factors (SRSF3 and hnRNPA3) correlated with increased severity of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein-induced pneumonia. N protein induced autophagic degradation of Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3, repressing miRNA biogenesis and RNA splicing and inducing DNA damage, proteotoxic stress, and pneumonia. Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3 were downregulated with age in mouse lung tissues. Older mice experienced more severe N protein-induced pneumonia than younger mice. However, treatment with a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PJ34) or aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) relieved N protein-induced pneumonia by restoring Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3 expression. These findings will aid in developing improved treatments for SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.\nUsing population dynamics to count bacteriophages and their lysogens\nAuthors: Geng, Y.; Nguyen, T. V. P.; Homaee, E.; Golding, I.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561271\nTraditional assays for counting bacteriophages and their lysogens are labor-intensive and highly perturbative to the host cells. Here, we present a high-throughput infection method where all steps--cell growth, viral encounters, and post-infection recovery--take place in a microplate reader, and the growth dynamics of the infected culture are measured continuously using the optical density (OD). We find that the post-infection dynamics are reproducible and interpretable. In particular, the OD at which the culture lyses scales linearly with the logarithm of the initial phage concentration, providing a way of measuring phage numbers in unknown samples over nine decades and down to single-phage sensitivity. Interpreting the measured dynamics using a mathematical model for the coupled kinetics of phages and bacteria further allows us to infer the rates of viral encounters and cell lysis. Adding a single step of antibiotic selection provides the ability to measure the rate of host lysogenization. To demonstrate the application of our assay, we characterized the effect of bacterial growth rate on the propensity of lambda phage to lysogenize E. coli. When infected by a single phage, the probability of lysogenization is found to decrease approximately exponentially with the host growth rate. In growing, but not in stationary, cells, the propensity to lysogenize increases ~50-fold when multiple phages co-infect the cell. These findings illuminate how host physiology feeds into the lysis/lysogeny decision circuit, and demonstrate the utility of high-throughput infection to interrogating phage-host interactions.\nDetection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human tissue via RNA in situ hybridization\nAuthors: Nargan, k.; Naidoo, T.; Msimang, M.; Nadeem, S.; Wells, G.; Hunter, R. L.; Hutton, A.; Lumamba, K.; Glasgow, J. N.; Benson, P. V.; Steyn, A. J.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560963\nRationale: Accurate TB diagnosis is hampered by the variable efficacy of the widely-used Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining method to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Here, we sought to circumvent this current limitation through direct detection of Mtb mRNA. Objectives: To employ RNAscope to determine the spatial distribution of Mtb mRNA within tuberculous human tissue, to appraise ZN-negative tissue from confirmed TB patients, and to provide proof-of-concept of RNAscope as a platform to inform TB diagnosis and Mtb biology. Methods: We examined ante- and postmortem human TB tissue using RNAscope to detect Mtb mRNA and a dual ZN/immunohistochemistry staining approach to identify AFB and bacilli producing antigen 85B (Ag85B). Measurements and main results: We adapted RNAscope for Mtb and identified intact and disintegrated Mtb bacilli and intra- and extracellular Mtb mRNA. Mtb mRNA was distributed zonally within necrotic and non-necrotic granulomas. We also found Mtb mRNA within, and adjacent to, necrotic granulomas in ZN-negative lung tissue and in Ag85B-positive bronchial epithelium. Intriguingly, we observed accumulation of Mtb mRNA and Ag85B in the cytoplasm of host cells. Notably, many AFB were negative for Ag85B staining. Mtb mRNA was observed in ZN-negative antemortem lymph node biopsies. Conclusions: RNAscope has diagnostic potential and can guide therapeutic intervention as it detects Mtb mRNA and morphology in ZN-negative tissues from TB patients, and Mtb mRNA in ZN-negative antemortem biopsies, respectively. Lastly, our data provide evidence that at least two phenotypically distinct populations of Mtb bacilli exist in vivo.\nTemperature Influences Commensal-Pathogen Dynamics in a Nasal Epithelial Cell Co-culture Model\nAuthors: Huffines, J. T.; Boone, R. L.; Kiedrowski, M. R.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561218\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses, and microbial dysbiosis associated with CRS is thought to be a key driver of host inflammation that contributes to disease progression. Staphylococcus aureus is a common upper respiratory tract (URT) pathobiont that is associated with higher carriage rates in CRS populations, where S. aureus secreted toxins can be identified in CRS tissue samples. Although many genera of bacteria colonize the URT, relatively few account for the majority of sequencing reads. These include S. aureus, as well as several species belonging to the genus Corynebacterium, including Corynebacterium propinquum and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, which are observed at high relative abundance in the URT of healthy individuals. Studies have examined the bacterial interactions between the major microbionts of the URT and S. aureus, but few have done so in the context of a healthy versus diseased URT environment. Here, we examine the role of temperature in commensal, pathogen, and epithelial dynamics using an air-liquid interface cell culture model mimicking the nasal epithelial environment. The healthy URT temperature changes from the nares to the nasopharynx and is altered during disease. Temperatures representative of the healthy URT increase persistence and aggregate formation of commensal C. propinquum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum, reduce S. aureus growth, and lower epithelial cytotoxicity compared to higher temperatures correlating with the diseased CRS sinus. Dual-species colonization revealed species-specific interactions between commensal Corynebacterium species and S. aureus dependent on temperature. Our findings suggest that URT mucosal temperature plays a significant role in mediating polymicrobial and host-bacterial interactions that may exacerbate microbial dysbiosis found in chronic URT disease.\nHost glutathione is required for Rickettsia parkeri to properly septate, avoid ubiquitylation, and survive in macrophages.\nAuthors: Sun, H.; Luu, A. P.; Danielson, M.; Vo, T. T.; Burke, T. P.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560592\nSpotted fever group Rickettsia obligately reside in the cytosol where they parasitize over fifty metabolites from their hosts. However, the role for metabolite acquisition in pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we find that depletion of the abundant low molecular weight thiol glutathione led to an impaired ability of Rickettsia parkeri to form plaques. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in endothelial or epithelial cells led to the formation of bacterial chains that increased in length over time. Chained bacteria had fewer actin-tails and were impeded for their ability to spread from cell to cell. Glutathione depletion also caused an increased frequency of colocalization between the bacterial surface and polyubiquitin. R. parkeri was significantly more restricted upon glutathione depletion in primary macrophages than in epithelial cells in a mechanism that avoided activating the inflammasome and the production of type I interferon. Together, these data suggest that host glutathione is critical for rickettsial septation, actin-based motility, avoiding ubiquitylation, and survival in immune cells.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria provides a formidable barrier, essential for both pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. Biogenesis of the outer membrane requires the transport of phospholipids across the cell envelope. Recently, YhdP was implicated as a major protagonist in the transport of phospholipids from the inner membrane to the outer membrane however the molecular mechanism of YhdP mediated transport remains elusive. Here, utilising AlphaFold, we observe YhdP to form an elongated assembly of 60 {beta} strands that curve to form a continuous hydrophobic groove. This architecture is consistent with our negative stain electron microscopy data which reveals YhdP to be approximately 250 [A] in length and thus sufficient to span the bacterial cell envelope. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo bacterial growth assays indicate essential helical regions at the N- and C-termini of YhdP, that may embed into the inner and outer membranes respectively, reinforcing its envelope spanning nature. Our in vivo crosslinking data reveal phosphate-containing substrates captured along the length of the YhdP groove, providing direct evidence that YhdP transports phospholipids. This finding is congruent with our molecular dynamics simulations which demonstrate the propensity for inner membrane lipids to spontaneously enter the groove of YhdP. Collectively, our results support a model in which YhdP bridges the cell envelope, providing a hydrophobic environment for the transport of phospholipids to the outer membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein is essential in mediating membrane fusion of the virus with the target cells. Several reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein fusogenicity is reportedly closely associated with the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus determined using hamster models. However, the association between S protein fusogenicity and other virological parameters remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the virological parameters of eleven previous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) correlating with S protein fusogenicity. S protein fusogenicity was found to be strongly correlated with S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size formed by clinical isolates. However, S protein fusogenicity was less associated with pseudoviral infectivity, pseudovirus entry efficiency, and viral replication kinetics. Taken together, our results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size could be potential indicators to predict the intrinsic pathogenicity of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacillus subtilis spores are produced inside the cytosol of a mother cell. Spore surface assembly requires the SpoVK protein in the mother cell, but its function is unknown. Here, we report that SpoVK is a dedicated chaperone from a distinct higher-order clade of AAA&#43; ATPases that activates the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase MurG during sporulation, even though MurG does not normally require activation by a chaperone during vegetative growth. MurG redeploys to the spore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment necessitates a specific chaperone for proper MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly inactivates SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA&#43; ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes other dedicated chaperones involved in secretion, cell-envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like dengue virus and parasites such as Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection (MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the Enterobacteriaceae comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of three genera, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Elizabethkingia, reveal lineages of mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in multiple laboratories. Investigation into species pangenomes further reveals clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future work to identify functions underlying mosquito host association. Altogether, we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly valuable resource to investigate factors for bacterial colonisation and adaptation within mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In bacteria, the availability of environmental inorganic phosphate is typically sensed by the conserved PhoR-PhoB two-component signal transduction pathway, which is thought to use the flux through the PstSCAB phosphate transporter as a readout of the extracellular phosphate level to control phosphate-responsive genes. While the sensing of environmental phosphate is well-investigated, the regulatory effects of cytoplasmic phosphate are unclear. Here, we disentangle the physiological and transcriptional responses of Caulobacter crescentus to changes in the environmental and cytoplasmic phosphate levels by uncoupling phosphate uptake from the activity of the PstSCAB system, using an additional, heterologously produced phosphate transporter. This approach reveals a two-pronged response of C. crescentus to phosphate limitation, in which PhoR-PhoB signaling mostly facilitates the utilization of alternative phosphate sources, whereas the cytoplasmic phosphate level controls the morphological and physiological adaptation of cells to growth under global phosphate limitation. These findings open the door to a comprehensive understanding of phosphate signaling in bacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age is a major risk factor for coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated severe pneumonia and mortality; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we investigated whether age-related deregulation of RNAi components and RNA splicing factors affects COVID-19 severity. Decreased expression of RNAi components (Dicer and XPO5) and splicing factors (SRSF3 and hnRNPA3) correlated with increased severity of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein-induced pneumonia. N protein induced autophagic degradation of Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3, repressing miRNA biogenesis and RNA splicing and inducing DNA damage, proteotoxic stress, and pneumonia. Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3 were downregulated with age in mouse lung tissues. Older mice experienced more severe N protein-induced pneumonia than younger mice. However, treatment with a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PJ34) or aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) relieved N protein-induced pneumonia by restoring Dicer, XPO5, SRSF3, and hnRNPA3 expression. These findings will aid in developing improved treatments for SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traditional assays for counting bacteriophages and their lysogens are labor-intensive and highly perturbative to the host cells. Here, we present a high-throughput infection method where all steps--cell growth, viral encounters, and post-infection recovery--take place in a microplate reader, and the growth dynamics of the infected culture are measured continuously using the optical density (OD). We find that the post-infection dynamics are reproducible and interpretable. In particular, the OD at which the culture lyses scales linearly with the logarithm of the initial phage concentration, providing a way of measuring phage numbers in unknown samples over nine decades and down to single-phage sensitivity. Interpreting the measured dynamics using a mathematical model for the coupled kinetics of phages and bacteria further allows us to infer the rates of viral encounters and cell lysis. Adding a single step of antibiotic selection provides the ability to measure the rate of host lysogenization. To demonstrate the application of our assay, we characterized the effect of bacterial growth rate on the propensity of lambda phage to lysogenize E. coli. When infected by a single phage, the probability of lysogenization is found to decrease approximately exponentially with the host growth rate. In growing, but not in stationary, cells, the propensity to lysogenize increases ~50-fold when multiple phages co-infect the cell. These findings illuminate how host physiology feeds into the lysis/lysogeny decision circuit, and demonstrate the utility of high-throughput infection to interrogating phage-host interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rationale: Accurate TB diagnosis is hampered by the variable efficacy of the widely-used Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining method to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Here, we sought to circumvent this current limitation through direct detection of Mtb mRNA. Objectives: To employ RNAscope to determine the spatial distribution of Mtb mRNA within tuberculous human tissue, to appraise ZN-negative tissue from confirmed TB patients, and to provide proof-of-concept of RNAscope as a platform to inform TB diagnosis and Mtb biology. Methods: We examined ante- and postmortem human TB tissue using RNAscope to detect Mtb mRNA and a dual ZN/immunohistochemistry staining approach to identify AFB and bacilli producing antigen 85B (Ag85B). Measurements and main results: We adapted RNAscope for Mtb and identified intact and disintegrated Mtb bacilli and intra- and extracellular Mtb mRNA. Mtb mRNA was distributed zonally within necrotic and non-necrotic granulomas. We also found Mtb mRNA within, and adjacent to, necrotic granulomas in ZN-negative lung tissue and in Ag85B-positive bronchial epithelium. Intriguingly, we observed accumulation of Mtb mRNA and Ag85B in the cytoplasm of host cells. Notably, many AFB were negative for Ag85B staining. Mtb mRNA was observed in ZN-negative antemortem lymph node biopsies. Conclusions: RNAscope has diagnostic potential and can guide therapeutic intervention as it detects Mtb mRNA and morphology in ZN-negative tissues from TB patients, and Mtb mRNA in ZN-negative antemortem biopsies, respectively. Lastly, our data provide evidence that at least two phenotypically distinct populations of Mtb bacilli exist in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses, and microbial dysbiosis associated with CRS is thought to be a key driver of host inflammation that contributes to disease progression. Staphylococcus aureus is a common upper respiratory tract (URT) pathobiont that is associated with higher carriage rates in CRS populations, where S. aureus secreted toxins can be identified in CRS tissue samples. Although many genera of bacteria colonize the URT, relatively few account for the majority of sequencing reads. These include S. aureus, as well as several species belonging to the genus Corynebacterium, including Corynebacterium propinquum and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, which are observed at high relative abundance in the URT of healthy individuals. Studies have examined the bacterial interactions between the major microbionts of the URT and S. aureus, but few have done so in the context of a healthy versus diseased URT environment. Here, we examine the role of temperature in commensal, pathogen, and epithelial dynamics using an air-liquid interface cell culture model mimicking the nasal epithelial environment. The healthy URT temperature changes from the nares to the nasopharynx and is altered during disease. Temperatures representative of the healthy URT increase persistence and aggregate formation of commensal C. propinquum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum, reduce S. aureus growth, and lower epithelial cytotoxicity compared to higher temperatures correlating with the diseased CRS sinus. Dual-species colonization revealed species-specific interactions between commensal Corynebacterium species and S. aureus dependent on temperature. Our findings suggest that URT mucosal temperature plays a significant role in mediating polymicrobial and host-bacterial interactions that may exacerbate microbial dysbiosis found in chronic URT disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spotted fever group Rickettsia obligately reside in the cytosol where they parasitize over fifty metabolites from their hosts. However, the role for metabolite acquisition in pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we find that depletion of the abundant low molecular weight thiol glutathione led to an impaired ability of Rickettsia parkeri to form plaques. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in endothelial or epithelial cells led to the formation of bacterial chains that increased in length over time. Chained bacteria had fewer actin-tails and were impeded for their ability to spread from cell to cell. Glutathione depletion also caused an increased frequency of colocalization between the bacterial surface and polyubiquitin. R. parkeri was significantly more restricted upon glutathione depletion in primary macrophages than in epithelial cells in a mechanism that avoided activating the inflammasome and the production of type I interferon. Together, these data suggest that host glutathione is critical for rickettsial septation, actin-based motility, avoiding ubiquitylation, and survival in immune cells.</p>
