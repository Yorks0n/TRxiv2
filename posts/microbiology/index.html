XBB.1.9.2.5.1), a XBB subvariant bearing the S:Q52H and S:F456L substitutions, alongside the S:F486P substitution (Figure S1A), has rapidly spread in some countries. On July 19, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant under monitoring. First, we showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a higher effective reproduction number compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2), suggesting that EG.5.1 will spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants in the near future. We then addressed whether EG.5.1 evades from the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infection (BTI) of XBB subvariants and performed a neutralization assay using XBB BTI sera. However, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of XBB BTI sera against EG.5.1 was comparable to those against XBB.1.5/1.9.2 and XBB.1.16. Moreover, the sensitivity of EG.5.1 to convalescent sera of XBB.1- and XBB.1.5-infected hamsters was similar to those of XBB.1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16. These results suggest that the increased Re of EG.5.1 is attributed to neither increased infectivity nor immune evasion from XBB BTI, and the emergence and spread of EG.5 is driven by the other pressures. We previously demonstrated that Omicron BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against the variant infected. In fact, the NT50s of the BTI sera of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 against the variant infected were 3.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold lower than that against the ancestral B.1.1 variant, respectively. However, strikingly, we found that the NT50 of the BTI sera of XBB1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16 against the variant infected were 8.7- and 8.3-fold lower than that against the B.1.1 variant. These results suggest that XBB BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against XBB subvariants.

D.\nScore: 251.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553148\nBivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines expressing both the ancestral D614G and Omicron BA.5 spike proteins were introduced in August 2022 with the goal of broadening immunity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Subsequent studies on bivalent boosters found neutralizing antibody responses similar to boosters with the original monovalent vaccine, likely the result of immunological imprinting. Guidelines allow for administration of a second bivalent booster in high-risk groups, but it remains unknown whether this would broaden antibody responses. To address this question, we assessed longitudinal serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers in 18 elderly immunocompetent individuals (mean age 69) following a fourth monovalent booster and two BA.5 bivalent booster vaccines using pseudovirus neutralization assays against D614G, Omicron BA.5, and Omicron XBB.1.5. There was a small but significant increase in peak neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5 following the first bivalent booster, but no significant increase in peak titers following the second bivalent booster. Omicron-specific neutralizing titers remained low after both doses of the BA.5 bivalent booster. Our results suggest that a second dose of the BA.5 bivalent booster is not sufficient to broaden antibody responses and to overcome immunological imprinting. A monovalent vaccine targeting only the spike of the recently dominant SARS-CoV-2 may mitigate the back boosting associated with the original antigenic sin.\nPhenotyping the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters by digital pathology and machine learning\nAuthors: Meehan, G.

C.; Barclay, W.; Filipe, A. D. S.; Furnon, W.; Patel, A.; Palmarini, M.\nScore: 918.2, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551417\nSARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to multiple variants of concern (VOCs) with different biological properties. As the pandemic progresses, it will be essential to test in near real time the potential of any new emerging variant to cause severe disease. BA.1 (Omicron) was shown to be attenuated compared to the previous VOCs like Delta, but it is possible that newly emerging variants may regain a virulent phenotype. Hamsters have been proven to be an exceedingly good model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to develop robust quantitative pipelines to assess the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. We used various approaches including RNAseq, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and digital pathology, including software assisted whole section imaging and downstream automatic analyses enhanced by machine learning, to develop methods to assess and quantify virus-induced pulmonary lesions in an unbiased manner. Initially, we used Delta and Omicron to develop our experimental pipelines. We then assessed the virulence of recent Omicron sub-lineages including BA.5, XBB, BQ.1.18, BA.2 and BA.2.75. We show that in experimentally infected hamsters, accurate quantification of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage infiltrates represent robust markers for assessing the extent of virus-induced pulmonary pathology, and hence virus virulence. In addition, using these pipelines, we could reveal how some Omicron sub-lineages (e.g., BA.2.75) have regained virulence compared to the original BA.1. Finally, to maximise the utility of the digital pathology pipelines reported in our study, we developed an online repository containing representative whole organ histopathology sections that can be visualised at variable magnifications (https://covid-atlas.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Overall, this pipeline can provide unbiased and invaluable data for rapidly assessing newly emerging variants and their potential to cause severe disease.\nImpact of age and sex on neuroinflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a murine model\nAuthors: D Krishna, V.; Chang, A.; Korthas, H.; Var, S. R.; Low, W. C.; Li, L.; Cheeran, M. C.-J.\nScore: 67.1, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552998\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, is known to infect people of all ages and both sexes. Senior populations have the greatest risk of severe disease, and sexual dimorphism in clinical outcomes has been reported in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans can cause damage to multiple organ systems, including the brain. Neurological symptoms are widely observed in patients with COVID-19, with many survivors suffering from persistent neurological and cognitive impairment, potentially accelerating Alzheimer's disease. The present study aims to investigate the impact of age and sex on the neuroinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mouse model. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were inoculated, by intranasal route, with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.351 variant known to infect mice. Older animals and in particular males exhibited a significantly greater weight loss starting at 4 dpi. In addition, male animals exhibited higher viral RNA loads and higher titers of infectious virus in the lung, which was particularly evident in males at 16 months of age. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in the brains of infected mice, regardless of age or sex. Nevertheless, expression of IL-6, TNF-, and CCL-2 in the lung and brain was increased with viral infection. An unbiased brain RNA-seq/transcriptomic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant changes in gene expression profiles in the brain, with innate immunity, defense response to virus, cerebravascular and neuronal functions, as the major molecular networks affected. The data presented in this study show that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a neuroinflammatory response despite the lack of detectable virus in the brain. Age and sex have a modifying effect on this pathogenic process. Aberrant activation of innate immune response, disruption of blood-brain barrier and endothelial cell integrity, and supression of neuronal activity and axonogenesis underlie the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain. Understanding the role of these affected pathways in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis helps identify appropriate points of therapeutic interventions to alleviate neurological dysfunction observed during COVID-19.\nToxinome - The Bacterial Protein Toxin Database\nAuthors: Danov, A.; Segev, O.; Bograd, A.; Ben Eliyahu, Y.; Dotan, N.; Kaplan, T.; Levy, A.\nScore: 57.8, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553073\nProtein toxins are key molecular weapons in biology that are used to attack neighboring cells. Bacteria use protein toxins to kill or inhibit growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells using various modes of action that target essential cellular components. The toxins are responsible for shaping microbiomes in different habitats, for abortive phage infection, and for severe infectious diseases of animals and plants. Although several toxin databases have been developed, each one is devoted to a specific toxin family and they encompass a relatively small number of toxins. Antimicrobial toxins are often accompanied by antitoxins (or immunity proteins) that neutralize the cognate toxins. Here, we combined toxins and antitoxins from many resources and created Toxinome, a comprehensive and updated bacterial protein toxin database. Toxinome includes a total of 1,483,028 toxins and 491,345 antitoxins encoded in 59,475 bacterial genomes across the tree of life. We identified a depletion of toxin and antitoxin genes in bacteria that dwell in extreme temperatures. We defined 5,161 unique Toxin Islands within phylogenetically diverse bacterial genomes, which are loci dense in toxin and antitoxin genes. By focusing on the unannotated genes within these islands, we characterized a number of these genes as toxins or antitoxins. Finally, we developed an interactive Toxinome website (http://toxinome.pythonanywhere.com) that allows searching and downloading of our database. The Toxinome resource will be useful to the large research community interested in bacterial toxins and can guide toxin discovery and function elucidation, and infectious disease diagnosis and treatment.\nEpigenetic liquid biopsies reveal elevated vascular endothelial cell turnover and erythropoiesis in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients\nAuthors: Ben Ami, R.; Loyfer, N.; Cohn, E.; Fialkoff, G.; Sharkia, I.; Bogot, N.; Kochan, D.; Kalak, G.; Jarjoui, A.; Chen-Shuali, C.; Azulai, H.; Barhoum, H.; Arish, N.; Greenberger, M. M.; Velleman, D.; Kurd, R.; Chetrit, E. B.; Bohm, D.; Wolak, T.; Quteineh, A.; Cann, G.; Glaser, B.; Friedman, N.; Kaplan, T.; Shemer, R.; Rokach, A.; Dor, Y.\nScore: 346.1, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550957\nThe full spectrum of tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for deciphering the heterogenous clinical course of COVID-19. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in circulating chromatin to assess cell type-specific turnover in severe and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, in relation to clinical outcome. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a massive elevation of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels, which originated in lung epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells and erythroblasts, suggesting increased cell death or turnover in these tissues. The immune response to infection was reflected by elevated B cell and monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels, and by evidence of an interferon response in cells prior to cfDNA release. Strikingly, monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels (but not monocyte counts), as well as lung epithelium cfDNA and vascular endothelial cfDNA, predicted clinical deterioration and duration of hospitalization. Asymptomatic patients had elevated levels of immune-derived cfDNA but did not show evidence of pulmonary or cardiac damage. Surprisingly, these patients showed elevated levels of vascular endothelial cell and erythroblast cfDNA, suggesting that sub-clinical vascular and erythrocyte turnover are universal features of COVID-19, independent of disease severity. Epigenetic liquid biopsies provide non-invasive means of monitoring COVID-19 patients, and reveal sub-clinical vascular damage and red blood cell turnover.\nComprehensive Assessment of the Intrinsic Pancreatic Microbiome\nAuthors: Eckhoff, A. M.; Fletcher, A. A.; Kelly, M. S.; Dohlman, A.; McIntyre, C. A.; Shen, X.; Iyer, M. K.; Nussbaum, D. P.; Allen, P. J.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553074\nBackground: Small studies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) have suggested that intra-pancreatic microbial dysbiosis may drive malignant transformation. We sought to comprehensively profile tissue and cyst fluid in patients with benign, precancerous, and cancerous conditions of the pancreas to characterize the intrinsic pancreatic microbiome. Methods: Pancreatic samples were collected at the time of resection from 109 patients. Samples included tumor tissue (control, n=20; IPMN, n=20; PDAC, n=19) and pancreatic cyst fluid (IPMN, n=30; SCA, n=10; MCN, n=10). Assessment of bacterial DNA by quantitative PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed. Downstream analyses determined the relative abundances of individual taxa between groups and compared intergroup diversity. Whole-genome sequencing data from 140 patients with PDAC in the National Cancer Institutes Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) were analyzed to validate findings. Results: Sequencing of pancreatic tissue yielded few microbial reads regardless of diagnosis, and analysis of pancreatic tissue showed no difference in the abundance and composition of bacterial taxa between normal pancreas, IPMN, or PDAC groups. Low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) IPMN were characterized by low bacterial abundances with no difference in tissue composition and a slight increase in Pseudomonas and Sediminibacterium in HGD cyst fluid. Decontamination analysis using the CPTAC database confirmed a low-biomass, low-diversity intrinsic pancreatic microbiome that did not differ by pathology. Conclusions: Our analysis of the pancreatic microbiome demonstrated very low intrinsic biomass that is relatively conserved across diverse neoplastic conditions and thus unlikely to drive malignant transformation.\nAnalyses of cell wall synthesis in Clostridioides difficile reveal a diversification in cell division mechanisms in endospore-forming bacteria\nAuthors: Shrestha, S.; Taib, N.; Gribaldo, S.; Shen, A.\nScore: 31.7, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552200\nCurrent models of bacterial cell division assume that the core synthases of the multiprotein divisome complex, FtsW-FtsI, are the primary drivers of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. These enzymes are typically encoded in the highly conserved division and cell wall (dcw) cluster and are considered to be universally essential for cell division. Here, we combine bioinformatics analyses with functional characterization in the pathogen Clostridioides difficile to show that dcw-encoded PG synthases have undergone a surprising specialization in the sole endospore-forming phylum, Firmicutes, to fulfill sporulation-specific roles. We describe a novel role for these enzymes in synthesizing septal PG during the sporulation-specific mode of cell division in C. difficile. Although these enzymes are directly regulated by canonical divisome components during this process, dcw-encoded PG synthases and their divisome regulators are unexpectedly dispensable for cell division during normal growth. Instead, C. difficile uses its sole bifunctional class A penicillin-binding protein (aPBP) to drive cell division, revealing a previously unreported role for this class of PG synthases as the core divisome enzyme. Collectively, our findings reveal how the emergence of endosporulation in the Firmicutes phylum was a key driver for the functional repurposing of an otherwise universally conserved cellular process such as cell division. Moreover, they indicate that C. difficile, and likely other clostridia, assemble a divisome that differs markedly from previously studied bacteria, thus representing an attractive, unique target for therapeutic purposes.\nCell division machinery drives cell-specific gene activation during bacterial differentiation\nAuthors: Chareyre, S.; Li, X.; Anjuwon-Foster, B. R.; Clifford, S.; Brogan, A.; Su, Y.; Shroff, H.; Ramamurthi, K. S.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552768\nWhen faced with starvation, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis transforms itself into a dormant cell type called a \"spore\". Sporulation initiates with an asymmetric division event, which requires the relocation of the core divisome components FtsA and FtsZ, after which the sigma factor {sigma}F is exclusively activated in the smaller daughter cell. Compartment specific activation of {sigma}F requires the SpoIIE phosphatase, which displays a biased localization on one side of the asymmetric division septum and associates with the structural protein DivIVA, but the mechanism by which this preferential localization is achieved is unclear. Here, we isolated a variant of DivIVA that indiscriminately activates {sigma}F in both daughter cells due to promiscuous localization of SpoIIE, which was corrected by overproduction of FtsA and FtsZ. We propose that a unique feature of the sporulation septum, defined by the cell division machinery, drives the asymmetric localization of DivIVA and SpoIIE to trigger the initiation of the sporulation program.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection of human pluripotent stem cell-derived vascular cells reveals smooth muscle cells as key mediators of vascular pathology during infection\nAuthors: Richards, A.; Khalil, A.; Friesen, M.; Whitfield, T.; Lungjangwa, T.; Gehrke, L.; Mooney, D.; Jaenisch, R.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552160\nAlthough respiratory symptoms are the most prevalent disease manifestation of infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), nearly 20% of hospitalized patients are at risk for thromboembolic events1. This prothrombotic state is considered a key factor in the increased risk of stroke, which has been observed clinically during both acute infection and long after symptoms have cleared2. Here we developed a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells to recapitulate the vascular pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Our results demonstrate that perivascular cells, particularly smooth muscle cells (SMCs), are a specifically susceptible vascular target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Utilizing RNA sequencing, we characterized the transcriptomic changes accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection of SMCs, and endothelial cells (ECs). We observed that infected human SMCs shift to a pro-inflammatory state and increase the expression of key mediators of the coagulation cascade. Further, we showed human ECs exposed to the secretome of infected SMCs produce hemostatic factors that can contribute to vascular dysfunction, despite not being susceptible to direct infection. The findings here recapitulate observations from patient sera in human COVID-19 patients and provide mechanistic insight into the unique vascular implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection at a cellular level.\n",

        <p class="abstract">As of July 2023, EG.5.1 (a.k.a. XBB.1.9.2.5.1), a XBB subvariant bearing the S:Q52H and S:F456L substitutions, alongside the S:F486P substitution (Figure S1A), has rapidly spread in some countries. On July 19, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant under monitoring. First, we showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a higher effective reproduction number compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2), suggesting that EG.5.1 will spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants in the near future. We then addressed whether EG.5.1 evades from the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infection (BTI) of XBB subvariants and performed a neutralization assay using XBB BTI sera. However, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of XBB BTI sera against EG.5.1 was comparable to those against XBB.1.5/1.9.2 and XBB.1.16. Moreover, the sensitivity of EG.5.1 to convalescent sera of XBB.1- and XBB.1.5-infected hamsters was similar to those of XBB.1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16. These results suggest that the increased Re of EG.5.1 is attributed to neither increased infectivity nor immune evasion from XBB BTI, and the emergence and spread of EG.5 is driven by the other pressures. We previously demonstrated that Omicron BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against the variant infected. In fact, the NT50s of the BTI sera of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 against the variant infected were 3.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold lower than that against the ancestral B.1.1 variant, respectively. However, strikingly, we found that the NT50 of the BTI sera of XBB1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16 against the variant infected were 8.7- and 8.3-fold lower than that against the B.1.1 variant. These results suggest that XBB BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against XBB subvariants.

        <p class="abstract">Bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines expressing both the ancestral D614G and Omicron BA.5 spike proteins were introduced in August 2022 with the goal of broadening immunity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Subsequent studies on bivalent boosters found neutralizing antibody responses similar to boosters with the original monovalent vaccine, likely the result of immunological imprinting. Guidelines allow for administration of a second bivalent booster in high-risk groups, but it remains unknown whether this would broaden antibody responses. To address this question, we assessed longitudinal serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers in 18 elderly immunocompetent individuals (mean age 69) following a fourth monovalent booster and two BA.5 bivalent booster vaccines using pseudovirus neutralization assays against D614G, Omicron BA.5, and Omicron XBB.1.5. There was a small but significant increase in peak neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5 following the first bivalent booster, but no significant increase in peak titers following the second bivalent booster. Omicron-specific neutralizing titers remained low after both doses of the BA.5 bivalent booster. Our results suggest that a second dose of the BA.5 bivalent booster is not sufficient to broaden antibody responses and to overcome immunological imprinting. A monovalent vaccine targeting only the spike of the recently dominant SARS-CoV-2 may mitigate the back boosting associated with the original antigenic sin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to multiple variants of concern (VOCs) with different biological properties. As the pandemic progresses, it will be essential to test in near real time the potential of any new emerging variant to cause severe disease. BA.1 (Omicron) was shown to be attenuated compared to the previous VOCs like Delta, but it is possible that newly emerging variants may regain a virulent phenotype. Hamsters have been proven to be an exceedingly good model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to develop robust quantitative pipelines to assess the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. We used various approaches including RNAseq, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and digital pathology, including software assisted whole section imaging and downstream automatic analyses enhanced by machine learning, to develop methods to assess and quantify virus-induced pulmonary lesions in an unbiased manner. Initially, we used Delta and Omicron to develop our experimental pipelines. We then assessed the virulence of recent Omicron sub-lineages including BA.5, XBB, BQ.1.18, BA.2 and BA.2.75. We show that in experimentally infected hamsters, accurate quantification of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage infiltrates represent robust markers for assessing the extent of virus-induced pulmonary pathology, and hence virus virulence. In addition, using these pipelines, we could reveal how some Omicron sub-lineages (e.g., BA.2.75) have regained virulence compared to the original BA.1. Finally, to maximise the utility of the digital pathology pipelines reported in our study, we developed an online repository containing representative whole organ histopathology sections that can be visualised at variable magnifications (https://covid-atlas.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Overall, this pipeline can provide unbiased and invaluable data for rapidly assessing newly emerging variants and their potential to cause severe disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, is known to infect people of all ages and both sexes. Senior populations have the greatest risk of severe disease, and sexual dimorphism in clinical outcomes has been reported in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans can cause damage to multiple organ systems, including the brain. Neurological symptoms are widely observed in patients with COVID-19, with many survivors suffering from persistent neurological and cognitive impairment, potentially accelerating Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The present study aims to investigate the impact of age and sex on the neuroinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mouse model. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were inoculated, by intranasal route, with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.351 variant known to infect mice. Older animals and in particular males exhibited a significantly greater weight loss starting at 4 dpi. In addition, male animals exhibited higher viral RNA loads and higher titers of infectious virus in the lung, which was particularly evident in males at 16 months of age. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in the brains of infected mice, regardless of age or sex. Nevertheless, expression of IL-6, TNF-, and CCL-2 in the lung and brain was increased with viral infection. An unbiased brain RNA-seq/transcriptomic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant changes in gene expression profiles in the brain, with innate immunity, defense response to virus, cerebravascular and neuronal functions, as the major molecular networks affected. The data presented in this study show that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a neuroinflammatory response despite the lack of detectable virus in the brain. Age and sex have a modifying effect on this pathogenic process. Aberrant activation of innate immune response, disruption of blood-brain barrier and endothelial cell integrity, and supression of neuronal activity and axonogenesis underlie the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain. Understanding the role of these affected pathways in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis helps identify appropriate points of therapeutic interventions to alleviate neurological dysfunction observed during COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein toxins are key molecular weapons in biology that are used to attack neighboring cells. Bacteria use protein toxins to kill or inhibit growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells using various modes of action that target essential cellular components. The toxins are responsible for shaping microbiomes in different habitats, for abortive phage infection, and for severe infectious diseases of animals and plants. Although several toxin databases have been developed, each one is devoted to a specific toxin family and they encompass a relatively small number of toxins. Antimicrobial toxins are often accompanied by antitoxins (or immunity proteins) that neutralize the cognate toxins. Here, we combined toxins and antitoxins from many resources and created Toxinome, a comprehensive and updated bacterial protein toxin database. Toxinome includes a total of 1,483,028 toxins and 491,345 antitoxins encoded in 59,475 bacterial genomes across the tree of life. We identified a depletion of toxin and antitoxin genes in bacteria that dwell in extreme temperatures. We defined 5,161 unique Toxin Islands within phylogenetically diverse bacterial genomes, which are loci dense in toxin and antitoxin genes. By focusing on the unannotated genes within these islands, we characterized a number of these genes as toxins or antitoxins. Finally, we developed an interactive Toxinome website (http://toxinome.pythonanywhere.com) that allows searching and downloading of our database. The Toxinome resource will be useful to the large research community interested in bacterial toxins and can guide toxin discovery and function elucidation, and infectious disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The full spectrum of tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for deciphering the heterogenous clinical course of COVID-19. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in circulating chromatin to assess cell type-specific turnover in severe and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, in relation to clinical outcome. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a massive elevation of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels, which originated in lung epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells and erythroblasts, suggesting increased cell death or turnover in these tissues. The immune response to infection was reflected by elevated B cell and monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels, and by evidence of an interferon response in cells prior to cfDNA release. Strikingly, monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels (but not monocyte counts), as well as lung epithelium cfDNA and vascular endothelial cfDNA, predicted clinical deterioration and duration of hospitalization. Asymptomatic patients had elevated levels of immune-derived cfDNA but did not show evidence of pulmonary or cardiac damage. Surprisingly, these patients showed elevated levels of vascular endothelial cell and erythroblast cfDNA, suggesting that sub-clinical vascular and erythrocyte turnover are universal features of COVID-19, independent of disease severity. Epigenetic liquid biopsies provide non-invasive means of monitoring COVID-19 patients, and reveal sub-clinical vascular damage and red blood cell turnover.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Small studies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) have suggested that intra-pancreatic microbial dysbiosis may drive malignant transformation. We sought to comprehensively profile tissue and cyst fluid in patients with benign, precancerous, and cancerous conditions of the pancreas to characterize the intrinsic pancreatic microbiome. Methods: Pancreatic samples were collected at the time of resection from 109 patients. Samples included tumor tissue (control, n=20; IPMN, n=20; PDAC, n=19) and pancreatic cyst fluid (IPMN, n=30; SCA, n=10; MCN, n=10). Assessment of bacterial DNA by quantitative PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed. Downstream analyses determined the relative abundances of individual taxa between groups and compared intergroup diversity. Whole-genome sequencing data from 140 patients with PDAC in the National Cancer Institutes Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) were analyzed to validate findings. Results: Sequencing of pancreatic tissue yielded few microbial reads regardless of diagnosis, and analysis of pancreatic tissue showed no difference in the abundance and composition of bacterial taxa between normal pancreas, IPMN, or PDAC groups. Low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) IPMN were characterized by low bacterial abundances with no difference in tissue composition and a slight increase in Pseudomonas and Sediminibacterium in HGD cyst fluid. Decontamination analysis using the CPTAC database confirmed a low-biomass, low-diversity intrinsic pancreatic microbiome that did not differ by pathology. Conclusions: Our analysis of the pancreatic microbiome demonstrated very low intrinsic biomass that is relatively conserved across diverse neoplastic conditions and thus unlikely to drive malignant transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current models of bacterial cell division assume that the core synthases of the multiprotein divisome complex, FtsW-FtsI, are the primary drivers of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. These enzymes are typically encoded in the highly conserved division and cell wall (dcw) cluster and are considered to be universally essential for cell division. Here, we combine bioinformatics analyses with functional characterization in the pathogen Clostridioides difficile to show that dcw-encoded PG synthases have undergone a surprising specialization in the sole endospore-forming phylum, Firmicutes, to fulfill sporulation-specific roles. We describe a novel role for these enzymes in synthesizing septal PG during the sporulation-specific mode of cell division in C. difficile. Although these enzymes are directly regulated by canonical divisome components during this process, dcw-encoded PG synthases and their divisome regulators are unexpectedly dispensable for cell division during normal growth. Instead, C. difficile uses its sole bifunctional class A penicillin-binding protein (aPBP) to drive cell division, revealing a previously unreported role for this class of PG synthases as the core divisome enzyme. Collectively, our findings reveal how the emergence of endosporulation in the Firmicutes phylum was a key driver for the functional repurposing of an otherwise universally conserved cellular process such as cell division. Moreover, they indicate that C. difficile, and likely other clostridia, assemble a divisome that differs markedly from previously studied bacteria, thus representing an attractive, unique target for therapeutic purposes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When faced with starvation, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis transforms itself into a dormant cell type called a &#34;spore&#34;. Sporulation initiates with an asymmetric division event, which requires the relocation of the core divisome components FtsA and FtsZ, after which the sigma factor {sigma}F is exclusively activated in the smaller daughter cell. Compartment specific activation of {sigma}F requires the SpoIIE phosphatase, which displays a biased localization on one side of the asymmetric division septum and associates with the structural protein DivIVA, but the mechanism by which this preferential localization is achieved is unclear. Here, we isolated a variant of DivIVA that indiscriminately activates {sigma}F in both daughter cells due to promiscuous localization of SpoIIE, which was corrected by overproduction of FtsA and FtsZ. We propose that a unique feature of the sporulation septum, defined by the cell division machinery, drives the asymmetric localization of DivIVA and SpoIIE to trigger the initiation of the sporulation program.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although respiratory symptoms are the most prevalent disease manifestation of infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), nearly 20% of hospitalized patients are at risk for thromboembolic events1. This prothrombotic state is considered a key factor in the increased risk of stroke, which has been observed clinically during both acute infection and long after symptoms have cleared2. Here we developed a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells to recapitulate the vascular pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Our results demonstrate that perivascular cells, particularly smooth muscle cells (SMCs), are a specifically susceptible vascular target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Utilizing RNA sequencing, we characterized the transcriptomic changes accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection of SMCs, and endothelial cells (ECs). We observed that infected human SMCs shift to a pro-inflammatory state and increase the expression of key mediators of the coagulation cascade. Further, we showed human ECs exposed to the secretome of infected SMCs produce hemostatic factors that can contribute to vascular dysfunction, despite not being susceptible to direct infection. The findings here recapitulate observations from patient sera in human COVID-19 patients and provide mechanistic insight into the unique vascular implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection at a cellular level.</p>
