A.\nScore: 58.1, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574642\nSARS-CoV-2 can infect different organs, including the intestine. In Caco-2 intestinal cell line, SARS-CoV-2 modulates the ACE2 receptor expression and affects the expression of molecules involved in intercellular junctions. To further explore the possibility that the intestinal epithelium serves as an alternative infection route for SARS-CoV-2, we used a model of polarised intestinal cell monolayers grown on the polycarbonate membrane of Transwell inserts, inoculated with the virus either in the upper or lower chamber of culture. In both polarised Caco-2 cell monolayers and co-culture Caco-2/HT29 cell monolayer, apical SARS-CoV-2 inoculation was found to be much more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. In addition, apical SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers monolayer degeneration, as shown by histological examination, measurement of trans-epithelial electronic resistance, and cell adhesion molecule expression. During this process, the infectious viruses reach the lower chamber, suggesting either a transcytosis mechanism from the apical side to the basolateral side of cells, a paracellular trafficking of the virus after damage to intercellular junctions in the epithelial barrier, or both. Taken together, these data highlight a preferential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for the apical side of the human intestinal tract and suggests that infection via the intestinal lumen leads to a systemic infection.\nNRX-101 (D-Cycloserine + Lurasidone) , a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, is Active Against Drug-Resistant Urinary Pathogens In Vitro\nAuthors: Sapko, M. T.; Manyak, M.; Panicucci, R.; Javitt, J. C.\nScore: 42.5, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575572\nBackground: D-Cycloserine (DCS) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is currently FDA-approved to treat tuberculosis (TB) disease and urinary tract infection. Despite numerous reports showing good clinical efficacy, DCS fell out of favor as a UTI treatment because of its propensity to cause side effects. NRX-101, a fixed dose combination of DCS and lurasidone, has been awarded Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration and is being developed for various CNS indications because of its unique synergistic effect; each component mitigates side effects of the other. Methods: In this study, we tested NRX-101 against the urinary tract pathogens E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii in Mueller Hinton broth (caMHB) and artificial urine media (AUM). Several strains were multidrug resistant. Test compounds were serially diluted in broth/media. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of test compound at which no bacterial growth was observed. Results: DCS exhibited antibacterial efficacy against all strains tested while lurasidone did not appreciably affect the antibacterial action of DCS in vitro. In AUM, the MICs ranged from 128 to 512 mcg/ml for both DCS and NRX-101. In caMHB, MICs ranged from 8 to 1024 mcg/ml for NRX-101 and 32 to 512 mcg/ml for DCS alone. Conclusions: Our data confirm that DCS has antibacterial activity against reference and drug-resistant urinary pathogens. Furthermore, lurasidone does not interfere with anti-microbial action of DCS in vitro. These results support the clinical development of NRX-101 as a treatment for complicated urinary tract infections.\nTransient RNA structures underlie highly pathogenic avian influenza virus genesis\nAuthors: Funk, M.; Spronken, M. I.; Bestebroer, T. M.; de Bruin, A. C. M.; Gultyaev, A. P.; Fouchier, R. A. M.; te Velthuis, A. J. W.; Richard, M.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.574333\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause severe disease and high fatality in poultry1. They emerge exclusively from H5 and H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs)2. Although insertion of a furin-cleavable multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the hemagglutinin gene was identified decades ago as the genetic basis for LPAIV-to-HPAIV transition3,4, the exact mechanisms underlying said insertion have remained unknown. Here we used an innovative combination of bioinformatic models to predict RNA structures forming around the influenza virus RNA polymerase during replication, and circular sequencing5 to reliably detect nucleotide insertions. We show that transient H5 hemagglutinin RNA structures predicted to trap the polymerase on purine-rich sequences drive nucleotide insertions characteristic of MBCSs, providing the first strong empirical evidence of RNA structure involvement in MBCS acquisition. Insertion frequencies at the H5 cleavage site were strongly affected by substitutions in flanking genomic regions altering predicted transient RNA structures. Introduction of H5-like cleavage site sequences and structures into an H6 hemagglutinin resulted in MBCS-yielding insertions never observed before in H6 viruses. Our results demonstrate that nucleotide insertions that underlie H5 HPAIV emergence result from a previously unknown RNA-structure-driven diversity-generating mechanism, which could be shared with other RNA viruses.\nBroadly conserved FlgV controls flagellar assembly and Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination in mice\nAuthors: Zamba-Campero, M.; Soliman, D.; Yu, H.; Lasseter, A. G.; Chang, Y.-Y.; Liu, J.; Aravind, L.; Jewett, M. W.; Storz, G.; Adams, P. P.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574855\nFlagella propel pathogens through their environments yet are expensive to synthesize and are immunogenic. Thus, complex hierarchical regulatory networks control flagellar gene expression. Spirochetes are highly motile bacteria, but peculiarly in the Lyme spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the archetypal flagellar regulator {sigma}28 is absent. We rediscovered gene bb0268 in B. burgdorferi as flgV, a broadly-conserved gene in the flagellar superoperon alongside {sigma}28 in many Spirochaetes, Firmicutes and other phyla, with distant homologs in Epsilonproteobacteria. We found that B. burgdorferi FlgV is localized within flagellar motors. B. burgdorferi lacking flgV construct fewer and shorter flagellar filaments and are defective in cell division and motility. During the enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi lacking flgV survive and replicate in Ixodes ticks but are attenuated for dissemination and infection in mice. Our work defines infection timepoints when spirochete motility is most crucial and implicates FlgV as a broadly distributed structural flagellar component that modulates flagellar assembly.\nVariant-specific interactions at the plasma membrane: Heparan sulfate's impact on SARS-CoV-2 binding kinetics\nAuthors: Conca, D. V.; Bano, F.; von Wiren, J.; Scherrer, L.; Svirelis, J.; Thorsteinsson, K.; Dahlin, A.; Bally, M.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574981\nThe worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been characterised by the emergence of several variants of concern (VOCs) presenting an increasing number of mutations in the viral genome. The spike glycoprotein, responsible for engaging the viral receptor ACE2, exhibits the highest density of mutations, suggesting an ongoing evolution to optimize viral entry. However, previous studies focussed on isolated molecular interactions, neglecting the intricate composition of the plasma membrane and the interplay between viral attachment factors. Our study explores the role of avidity and of the complexity of the plasma membrane composition in modulating the virus-host binding kinetics during the early stages of viral entry for the original Wuhan strain and three VOCs: Omicron BA.1, Delta, and Alpha. We employ fluorescent liposomes decorated with spike from several VOCs as virion mimics in single-particle tracking studies on native supported lipid bilayers derived from pulmonary Calu-3 cells. Our findings reveal an increase in the affinity of the multivalent bond to the cell surface for Omicron driven by an increased association rate. We show that heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated glycosaminoglycan commonly expressed on cells plasma membrane, plays a central role in modulating the interaction with the cell surface and we observe a shift in its role from screening the interaction with ACE2 in early VOCs to an important binding factor for Omicron. This is caused by a [~]10-fold increase in Omicrons affinity to HS compared to the original Wuhan strain, as shown using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results show the importance of coreceptors, particularly HS, and membrane complexity in the modulation of the attachment in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. We highlight a transition in the variants attachment strategy towards the use of HS as an initial docking site, which likely plays a role in shaping Omicrons tropism towards infection of the upper airways, milder symptoms, and higher transmissibility.\nRobust control of replication initiation in the absence of DnaA-ATP {leftrightharpoons} DnaA-ADP regulatory elements in Escherichia coli\nAuthors: Boesen, T.; Charbon, G.; Fu, H.; Jensen, C.; Sandler, M.; Li, D.; Jun, S.; Lobner-Olesen, A.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2022.09.08.507175\nInvestigating a long-standing conceptual question in bacterial physiology, we examine why DnaA, the bacterial master replication initiator protein, exists in both ATP and ADP forms, despite only the ATP form being essential for initiation. We engineered the {Delta}4 Escherichia coli strain, devoid of all known external elements facilitating the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion, and found that these cells display nearly wild-type behaviors under non-overlapping replication cycles. However, during rapid growth with overlapping cycles, {Delta}4 cells exhibit initiation instability. This aligns with our model predictions, suggesting that the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA alone is sufficient for robust initiation control in E. coli and the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion regulatory elements extend the robustness to multifork replication, indicating an evolutionary adaptation. Moreover, our experiments revealed constant DnaA concentrations during steady-state cell elongation in both wild-type and {Delta}4 cells. These insights not only advance our understanding of bacterial cell-cycle regulation and DnaA, but also highlight a fundamental divergence from eukaryotic cell-cycle controls, emphasizing protein copy-number sensing in bacteria versus programmed protein concentration oscillations in eukaryotes.\nMixed Alkyl/Aryl Phosphonates Identify Metabolic Serine Hydrolases as Antimalarial Targets\nAuthors: Bennett, J. M.; Narwal, S. K.; Kabeche, S.; Abegg, D.; Hackett, F.; Yeo, T.; Li, V.; Muir, R. K.; Faucher, F. F.; Lovell, S.; Blackman, M.; Adibekian, A.; Yeh, E.; Fidock, D. A.; Bogyo, M.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575224\nMalaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, remains a significant health burden. A barrier for developing anti-malarial drugs is the ability of the parasite to rapidly generate resistance. We demonstrated that Salinipostin A (SalA), a natural product, kills parasites by inhibiting multiple lipid metabolizing serine hydrolases, a mechanism with a low propensity for resistance. Given the difficulty of employing natural products as therapeutic agents, we synthesized a library of lipidic mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates as bioisosteres of SalA. Two constitutional isomers exhibited divergent anti-parasitic potencies which enabled identification of therapeutically relevant targets. We also confirm that this compound kills parasites through a mechanism that is distinct from both SalA and the pan-lipase inhibitor, Orlistat. Like SalA, our compound induces only weak resistance, attributable to mutations in a single protein involved in multidrug resistance. These data suggest that mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates are a promising, synthetically tractable anti-malarials with a low-propensity to induce resistance.\nThe relationship between gut and nasopharyngeal microbiome composition can predict the severity of COVID-19\nAuthors: Martin-Castano, B.; Diez-Echave, P.; Garcia-Garcia, J.; Hidalgo-Garcia, L.; Ruiz-Malagon, A.

E.; Carazo, A.; Martin, J.; Moron, R.; Rodriguez, A.; Galvez, J.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575201\nBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that displays great variability in clinical phenotype. Many factors have been described to be correlated with its severity but no specific determinants of infection outcome have been identified yet, maybe due the complex pathogenic mechanisms. The microbiota could play a key role in the infection and in the progression and outcome of the disease. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with nasopharyngeal and gut dysbiosis and higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens. MethodsTo identify new prognostic markers for the disease, a multicenter prospective observational cohort study was carried out in COVID-19 patients that were divided in three cohorts according to their symptomatology: mild (n=24), moderate (n=51) and severe/critical (n=31). Faecal and nasopharyngeal samples were taken and the microbiota was analysed. ResultsMicrobiota composition could be associated with the severity of the symptoms and the linear discriminant analysis identified the genera Mycoplasma and Prevotella as severity biomarkers in nasopharyngeal samples, and Allistipes, Enterococcus and Escherichia in faecal samples. Moreover, M. salivarium was defined as a unique microorganism in COVID-19 patients nasopharyngeal microbiota while P. bivia and P. timonensis were defined in faecal microbiota. A connection between faecal and nasopharyngeal microbiota in COVID-19 patients was also identified as a strong positive correlation between P. timonensis (faeces) towards P. dentalis and M. salivarium (nasopharyngeal) was found in critically ill patients. ConclusionsThis ratio could be used as a novel prognostic biomarker for severe COVID-19 patients.\nLarge-scale computational analyses of gut microbial CAZyme repertoires enabled by Cayman\nAuthors: Ducarmon, Q. R.; Karcher, N.; Tytgat, H. L. P.; Delannoy-Bruno, O.; Pekel, S.; Springer, F.; Schudoma, C.; Zeller, G.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574624\nCarbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are crucial for digesting glycans, but bioinformatics tools for CAZyme profiling and interpretation of substrate preferences in microbial community data are lacking. To address this, we developed a CAZyme profiler (Cayman) and a hierarchical substrate annotation scheme. Leveraging these, we genomically survey CAZymes in human gut microbes (n=107,683 genomes), which suggests novel mucin-foraging species. In a subsequent meta-analysis of CAZyme repertoires in Western versus non-Western gut metagenomes (n=4,281) we find that non-Western metagenomes are richer in fibre-degrading CAZymes despite lower overall CAZyme richness. We additionally pinpoint the taxonomic drivers underlying these CAZyme community shifts. A second meta-analysis comparing colorectal cancer patients (CRC) to controls (n=1,998) shows that CRC metagenomes are deprived of dietary fibre-targeting, but enriched in glycosaminoglycan-targeting CAZymes. A genomic analysis of co-localizing CAZyme domains predicts novel substrates for CRC-enriched CAZymes. Cayman is broadly applicable across microbial communities and freely available from https://github.com/zellerlab/cayman.\n",

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 can infect different organs, including the intestine. In Caco-2 intestinal cell line, SARS-CoV-2 modulates the ACE2 receptor expression and affects the expression of molecules involved in intercellular junctions. To further explore the possibility that the intestinal epithelium serves as an alternative infection route for SARS-CoV-2, we used a model of polarised intestinal cell monolayers grown on the polycarbonate membrane of Transwell inserts, inoculated with the virus either in the upper or lower chamber of culture. In both polarised Caco-2 cell monolayers and co-culture Caco-2/HT29 cell monolayer, apical SARS-CoV-2 inoculation was found to be much more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. In addition, apical SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers monolayer degeneration, as shown by histological examination, measurement of trans-epithelial electronic resistance, and cell adhesion molecule expression. During this process, the infectious viruses reach the lower chamber, suggesting either a transcytosis mechanism from the apical side to the basolateral side of cells, a paracellular trafficking of the virus after damage to intercellular junctions in the epithelial barrier, or both. Taken together, these data highlight a preferential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for the apical side of the human intestinal tract and suggests that infection via the intestinal lumen leads to a systemic infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: D-Cycloserine (DCS) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is currently FDA-approved to treat tuberculosis (TB) disease and urinary tract infection. Despite numerous reports showing good clinical efficacy, DCS fell out of favor as a UTI treatment because of its propensity to cause side effects. NRX-101, a fixed dose combination of DCS and lurasidone, has been awarded Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration and is being developed for various CNS indications because of its unique synergistic effect; each component mitigates side effects of the other. Methods: In this study, we tested NRX-101 against the urinary tract pathogens E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii in Mueller Hinton broth (caMHB) and artificial urine media (AUM). Several strains were multidrug resistant. Test compounds were serially diluted in broth/media. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of test compound at which no bacterial growth was observed. Results: DCS exhibited antibacterial efficacy against all strains tested while lurasidone did not appreciably affect the antibacterial action of DCS in vitro. In AUM, the MICs ranged from 128 to 512 mcg/ml for both DCS and NRX-101. In caMHB, MICs ranged from 8 to 1024 mcg/ml for NRX-101 and 32 to 512 mcg/ml for DCS alone. Conclusions: Our data confirm that DCS has antibacterial activity against reference and drug-resistant urinary pathogens. Furthermore, lurasidone does not interfere with anti-microbial action of DCS in vitro. These results support the clinical development of NRX-101 as a treatment for complicated urinary tract infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause severe disease and high fatality in poultry1. They emerge exclusively from H5 and H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs)2. Although insertion of a furin-cleavable multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the hemagglutinin gene was identified decades ago as the genetic basis for LPAIV-to-HPAIV transition3,4, the exact mechanisms underlying said insertion have remained unknown. Here we used an innovative combination of bioinformatic models to predict RNA structures forming around the influenza virus RNA polymerase during replication, and circular sequencing5 to reliably detect nucleotide insertions. We show that transient H5 hemagglutinin RNA structures predicted to trap the polymerase on purine-rich sequences drive nucleotide insertions characteristic of MBCSs, providing the first strong empirical evidence of RNA structure involvement in MBCS acquisition. Insertion frequencies at the H5 cleavage site were strongly affected by substitutions in flanking genomic regions altering predicted transient RNA structures. Introduction of H5-like cleavage site sequences and structures into an H6 hemagglutinin resulted in MBCS-yielding insertions never observed before in H6 viruses. Our results demonstrate that nucleotide insertions that underlie H5 HPAIV emergence result from a previously unknown RNA-structure-driven diversity-generating mechanism, which could be shared with other RNA viruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Flagella propel pathogens through their environments yet are expensive to synthesize and are immunogenic. Thus, complex hierarchical regulatory networks control flagellar gene expression. Spirochetes are highly motile bacteria, but peculiarly in the Lyme spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the archetypal flagellar regulator {sigma}28 is absent. We rediscovered gene bb0268 in B. burgdorferi as flgV, a broadly-conserved gene in the flagellar superoperon alongside {sigma}28 in many Spirochaetes, Firmicutes and other phyla, with distant homologs in Epsilonproteobacteria. We found that B. burgdorferi FlgV is localized within flagellar motors. B. burgdorferi lacking flgV construct fewer and shorter flagellar filaments and are defective in cell division and motility. During the enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi lacking flgV survive and replicate in Ixodes ticks but are attenuated for dissemination and infection in mice. Our work defines infection timepoints when spirochete motility is most crucial and implicates FlgV as a broadly distributed structural flagellar component that modulates flagellar assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been characterised by the emergence of several variants of concern (VOCs) presenting an increasing number of mutations in the viral genome. The spike glycoprotein, responsible for engaging the viral receptor ACE2, exhibits the highest density of mutations, suggesting an ongoing evolution to optimize viral entry. However, previous studies focussed on isolated molecular interactions, neglecting the intricate composition of the plasma membrane and the interplay between viral attachment factors. Our study explores the role of avidity and of the complexity of the plasma membrane composition in modulating the virus-host binding kinetics during the early stages of viral entry for the original Wuhan strain and three VOCs: Omicron BA.1, Delta, and Alpha. We employ fluorescent liposomes decorated with spike from several VOCs as virion mimics in single-particle tracking studies on native supported lipid bilayers derived from pulmonary Calu-3 cells. Our findings reveal an increase in the affinity of the multivalent bond to the cell surface for Omicron driven by an increased association rate. We show that heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated glycosaminoglycan commonly expressed on cells plasma membrane, plays a central role in modulating the interaction with the cell surface and we observe a shift in its role from screening the interaction with ACE2 in early VOCs to an important binding factor for Omicron. This is caused by a [~]10-fold increase in Omicrons affinity to HS compared to the original Wuhan strain, as shown using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results show the importance of coreceptors, particularly HS, and membrane complexity in the modulation of the attachment in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. We highlight a transition in the variants attachment strategy towards the use of HS as an initial docking site, which likely plays a role in shaping Omicrons tropism towards infection of the upper airways, milder symptoms, and higher transmissibility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Investigating a long-standing conceptual question in bacterial physiology, we examine why DnaA, the bacterial master replication initiator protein, exists in both ATP and ADP forms, despite only the ATP form being essential for initiation. We engineered the {Delta}4 Escherichia coli strain, devoid of all known external elements facilitating the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion, and found that these cells display nearly wild-type behaviors under non-overlapping replication cycles. However, during rapid growth with overlapping cycles, {Delta}4 cells exhibit initiation instability. This aligns with our model predictions, suggesting that the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA alone is sufficient for robust initiation control in E. coli and the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion regulatory elements extend the robustness to multifork replication, indicating an evolutionary adaptation. Moreover, our experiments revealed constant DnaA concentrations during steady-state cell elongation in both wild-type and {Delta}4 cells. These insights not only advance our understanding of bacterial cell-cycle regulation and DnaA, but also highlight a fundamental divergence from eukaryotic cell-cycle controls, emphasizing protein copy-number sensing in bacteria versus programmed protein concentration oscillations in eukaryotes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, remains a significant health burden. A barrier for developing anti-malarial drugs is the ability of the parasite to rapidly generate resistance. We demonstrated that Salinipostin A (SalA), a natural product, kills parasites by inhibiting multiple lipid metabolizing serine hydrolases, a mechanism with a low propensity for resistance. Given the difficulty of employing natural products as therapeutic agents, we synthesized a library of lipidic mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates as bioisosteres of SalA. Two constitutional isomers exhibited divergent anti-parasitic potencies which enabled identification of therapeutically relevant targets. We also confirm that this compound kills parasites through a mechanism that is distinct from both SalA and the pan-lipase inhibitor, Orlistat. Like SalA, our compound induces only weak resistance, attributable to mutations in a single protein involved in multidrug resistance. These data suggest that mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates are a promising, synthetically tractable anti-malarials with a low-propensity to induce resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that displays great variability in clinical phenotype. Many factors have been described to be correlated with its severity but no specific determinants of infection outcome have been identified yet, maybe due the complex pathogenic mechanisms. The microbiota could play a key role in the infection and in the progression and outcome of the disease. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with nasopharyngeal and gut dysbiosis and higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens.

MethodsTo identify new prognostic markers for the disease, a multicenter prospective observational cohort study was carried out in COVID-19 patients that were divided in three cohorts according to their symptomatology: mild (n=24), moderate (n=51) and severe/critical (n=31). Faecal and nasopharyngeal samples were taken and the microbiota was analysed.

ResultsMicrobiota composition could be associated with the severity of the symptoms and the linear discriminant analysis identified the genera Mycoplasma and Prevotella as severity biomarkers in nasopharyngeal samples, and Allistipes, Enterococcus and Escherichia in faecal samples. Moreover, M. salivarium was defined as a unique microorganism in COVID-19 patients nasopharyngeal microbiota while P. bivia and P. timonensis were defined in faecal microbiota. A connection between faecal and nasopharyngeal microbiota in COVID-19 patients was also identified as a strong positive correlation between P. timonensis (faeces) towards P. dentalis and M. salivarium (nasopharyngeal) was found in critically ill patients.

ConclusionsThis ratio could be used as a novel prognostic biomarker for severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are crucial for digesting glycans, but bioinformatics tools for CAZyme profiling and interpretation of substrate preferences in microbial community data are lacking. To address this, we developed a CAZyme profiler (Cayman) and a hierarchical substrate annotation scheme. Leveraging these, we genomically survey CAZymes in human gut microbes (n=107,683 genomes), which suggests novel mucin-foraging species. In a subsequent meta-analysis of CAZyme repertoires in Western versus non-Western gut metagenomes (n=4,281) we find that non-Western metagenomes are richer in fibre-degrading CAZymes despite lower overall CAZyme richness. We additionally pinpoint the taxonomic drivers underlying these CAZyme community shifts. A second meta-analysis comparing colorectal cancer patients (CRC) to controls (n=1,998) shows that CRC metagenomes are deprived of dietary fibre-targeting, but enriched in glycosaminoglycan-targeting CAZymes. A genomic analysis of co-localizing CAZyme domains predicts novel substrates for CRC-enriched CAZymes. Cayman is broadly applicable across microbial communities and freely available from https://github.com/zellerlab/cayman.</p>
