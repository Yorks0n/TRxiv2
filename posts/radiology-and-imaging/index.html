E.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300222\nFocused ultrasound (FUS) has recently shown great promise in facilitating blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO) for drug delivery and immunotherapy in Alzheimers disease. However, FUS-mediated BBBO treatment is currently limited to systems integrated with the MRI or post-surgical implants, thus restricting its widespread clinical adoption. In this pilot study, we present the outcomes of a phase 1 clinical study with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease patients (N=6) using a portable neuronavigated FUS system that did not require surgery or an online MRI during treatment. BBBO occurred in 5 out of 6 subjects with the volume of 983{+/-}626 mm3 following a single session of FUS at the right frontal lobe. The outpatient treatment was completed within 34.8{+/-}10.7 min. Real-time cavitation monitoring was used to ensure the efficacy and safety of the BBBO procedure. Cavitation doses significantly correlated with the BBBO volume (R2\u003e0.9, p\u003c0.05), demonstrating the portable FUS systems capability of predicting opening volumes. Larger BBBO volumes correlated with increased levels of Alzheimers disease biomarkers assayed in serum-derived extracellular vesicles, including A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (R2=0.74, p=0.1), Tau (R2=0.95, p=0.02), and P-Tau181 (R2=0.86, p=0.02), indicating the release of the two hallmark proteins into the bloodstream. Subjects showed a reduced A{beta} accumulation rate in the treated frontal lobe region compared to the contralateral, as indicated by 18F-Florbetapir PET scans. Clinical changes in mini-mental state examination over 6 months were within the expected range of decline. In conclusion, we have shown the safety and feasibility of this low-cost and portable FUS for BBBO in Alzheimers patients, providing a new avenue for FUS treatment in Alzheimers disease, with or without drug delivery.\nRapid submillimeter QSM and R2* mapping using interleaved multi-shot 3D-EPI at 7 and 3 Tesla\nAuthors: Stirnberg, R.; Deistung, A.; Reichenbach, J. R.; Breteler, M. M. B.; Stöcker, T.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300637\nPurpose To explore the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency of interleaved multi-shot 3D-EPI for fast and robust high-resolution whole-brain quantitative susceptibility (QSM) and R2* mapping at 7T and 3T. Methods Single- and multi-TE segmented 3D-EPI is combined with conventional CAIPIRINHA undersampling for up to 72-fold effective gradient echo (GRE) imaging acceleration. Across multiple averages, scan parameters are varied (e.g. dual-polarity frequency-encoding) to additionally correct for B0-induced artifacts, geometric distortions and motion retrospectively. A comparison to established GRE protocols is made. Resolutions range from 1.4mm isotropic (1 multi-TE average in 36s) up to 0.4mm isotropic (2 single-TE averages in approximately 6 minutes) with whole-head coverage. Results Only 1-4 averages are needed for sufficient SNR with 3D-EPI, depending on resolution and field strength. Fast scanning and small voxels together with retrospective corrections result in substantially reduced image artifacts, which improves susceptibility and R2* mapping. Additionally, much finer details are obtained in susceptibility-weighted image projections through significantly reduced partial voluming. Conclusion Using interleaved multi-shot 3D-EPI, single-TE and multi-TE data can readily be acquired 10 times faster than with conventional, accelerated GRE imaging. Even 0.4mm isotropic whole-head QSM within 6 minutes becomes feasible at 7T. At 3T, motion-robust and distortion-free 0.8mm isotropic whole-brain QSM and R2* mapping in less than 7 minutes becomes clinically feasible. Stronger gradient systems may allow for even higher effective acceleration rates through larger EPI factors while maintaining optimal contrast.

R.; Shin\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300642\nBrain aging is a complex process influenced by various lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors, as well as by age-related and often co-existing pathologies. MRI and, more recently, AI methods have been instrumental in understanding the neuroanatomical changes that occur during aging in large and diverse populations. However, the multiplicity and mutual overlap of both pathologic processes and affected brain regions make it difficult to precisely characterize the underlying neurodegenerative profile of an individual from an MRI scan. Herein, we leverage a state-of-the art deep representation learning method, Surreal-GAN, and present both methodological advances and extensive experimental results that allow us to elucidate the heterogeneity of brain aging in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals from 11 studies. Five dominant patterns of neurodegeneration were identified and quantified for each individual by their respective (herein referred to as) R-indices. Significant associations between R-indices and distinct biomedical, lifestyle, and genetic factors provide insights into the etiology of observed variances. Furthermore, baseline R-indices showed predictive value for disease progression and mortality. These five R-indices contribute to MRI-based precision diagnostics, prognostication, and may inform stratification into clinical trials.\nDetection of Lung Cancer Cases in Chest CT Scans Utilizing Artificial Intelligence: A Retrospective Analysis of Data During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Zukov, R.

A.; Blokhina, M. E.; Nalivkina, E. A.; Gombolevskiy, V. A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23299170\nPurpose: To evaluate the potential of using an artificial intelligence (AI) to detect patients with a high likelihood of lung cancer (LC) using CTs obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective study in the Krasnoyarsk region, Russia analyzed CTs of COVID-19 patients using the automated algorithm, Chest-IRA by AIRA Labs. Pulmonary nodules larger than 100 mm3 were identified by the AI and assessed by four radiologists, who categorized them into three groups: \"high probability of LC\", \"insufficiently convincing evidence of LC\", \"without evidence of LC\". The study also estimated the economic impact of the AI by considering labor costs and savings on treatment for patients in the early stages compared to late stages, taking into account the saved life years and their potential contribution to the gross regional product. Results: An AI identified lung nodules in 484 out of 10,500 chest CTs, with 252 cases having high and intermediate probabilities of LC. Among 100 histologically verified LC cases, 35 were in stages I-II and 65 were in stages III-IV. Using AI instead of CT review by radiologists will save 2.43 million rubles (23,786 EUR/ 26690 USD/ 196,536 CNY) in direct salary, with expected savings to the regional budget of 8.22 million rubles (80,463 EUR/ 90,466 USD/ 666,162 CNY). The financial equivalent of the life years saved was 173.25 million rubles (1,695,892 EUR/ 1905750 USD/ 14,033,250 CNY). The total effect over five years is estimated at 183.9 million rubles (1,800,142 EUR/ 2,022,907 USD/ 14,895,949 CNY). Conclusion: Using AI to evaluate large volumes of chest CTs done for reasons unrelated to lung cancer screening may facilitate early and cost-effective detection of incidental pulmonary nodules that might otherwise be missed.\nDeep Learning in Magnetic Resonance Enterography for Crohn's Disease Assessment: A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Brem, O.; Elisha, D.; Konen, E.; Amitai, M.; Klang, E.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300507\nCrohn's disease (CD) poses significant morbidity, underscoring the need for effective, non-invasive inflammatory assessment using magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This literature review evaluates recent publications on deep learning's role in enhancing MRE segmentation, image quality, and visualization of inflammatory activity related to CD. We searched MEDLINE/PUBMED for studies that reported the use of deep learning algorithms for assessment of CD activity. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Five eligible studies, encompassing 468 subjects, were identified. Our study suggests that diverse deep learning applications, including image quality enhancement, bowel segmentation, and motility measurement are useful and promising for CD assessment. However, most of the studies are preliminary, retrospective studies, and have a high risk of bias in at least one category. Future research is needed to assess how automated deep learning can impact patient care, especially when considering the increasing integration of these models into hospital systems.\n",

The outpatient treatment was completed within 34.8{&#43;/-}10.7 min. Real-time cavitation monitoring was used to ensure the efficacy and safety of the BBBO procedure. Cavitation doses significantly correlated with the BBBO volume (R2&gt;0.9, p&lt;0.05), demonstrating the portable FUS systems capability of predicting opening volumes. Larger BBBO volumes correlated with increased levels of Alzheimers disease biomarkers assayed in serum-derived extracellular vesicles, including A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (R2=0.74, p=0.1), Tau (R2=0.95, p=0.02), and P-Tau181 (R2=0.86, p=0.02), indicating the release of the two hallmark proteins into the bloodstream. Subjects showed a reduced A{beta} accumulation rate in the treated frontal lobe region compared to the contralateral, as indicated by 18F-Florbetapir PET scans. Clinical changes in mini-mental state examination over 6 months were within the expected range of decline. In conclusion, we have shown the safety and feasibility of this low-cost and portable FUS for BBBO in Alzheimers patients, providing a new avenue for FUS treatment in Alzheimers disease, with or without drug delivery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose To explore the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency of interleaved multi-shot 3D-EPI for fast and robust high-resolution whole-brain quantitative susceptibility (QSM) and R2* mapping at 7T and 3T. Methods Single- and multi-TE segmented 3D-EPI is combined with conventional CAIPIRINHA undersampling for up to 72-fold effective gradient echo (GRE) imaging acceleration. Across multiple averages, scan parameters are varied (e.g. dual-polarity frequency-encoding) to additionally correct for B0-induced artifacts, geometric distortions and motion retrospectively. A comparison to established GRE protocols is made. Resolutions range from 1.4mm isotropic (1 multi-TE average in 36s) up to 0.4mm isotropic (2 single-TE averages in approximately 6 minutes) with whole-head coverage. Results Only 1-4 averages are needed for sufficient SNR with 3D-EPI, depending on resolution and field strength. Fast scanning and small voxels together with retrospective corrections result in substantially reduced image artifacts, which improves susceptibility and R2* mapping. Additionally, much finer details are obtained in susceptibility-weighted image projections through significantly reduced partial voluming. Conclusion Using interleaved multi-shot 3D-EPI, single-TE and multi-TE data can readily be acquired 10 times faster than with conventional, accelerated GRE imaging. Even 0.4mm isotropic whole-head QSM within 6 minutes becomes feasible at 7T. At 3T, motion-robust and distortion-free 0.8mm isotropic whole-brain QSM and R2* mapping in less than 7 minutes becomes clinically feasible. Stronger gradient systems may allow for even higher effective acceleration rates through larger EPI factors while maintaining optimal contrast.

        <p class="abstract">Brain aging is a complex process influenced by various lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors, as well as by age-related and often co-existing pathologies. MRI and, more recently, AI methods have been instrumental in understanding the neuroanatomical changes that occur during aging in large and diverse populations. However, the multiplicity and mutual overlap of both pathologic processes and affected brain regions make it difficult to precisely characterize the underlying neurodegenerative profile of an individual from an MRI scan. Herein, we leverage a state-of-the art deep representation learning method, Surreal-GAN, and present both methodological advances and extensive experimental results that allow us to elucidate the heterogeneity of brain aging in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals from 11 studies. Five dominant patterns of neurodegeneration were identified and quantified for each individual by their respective (herein referred to as) R-indices. Significant associations between R-indices and distinct biomedical, lifestyle, and genetic factors provide insights into the etiology of observed variances. Furthermore, baseline R-indices showed predictive value for disease progression and mortality. These five R-indices contribute to MRI-based precision diagnostics, prognostication, and may inform stratification into clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: To evaluate the potential of using an artificial intelligence (AI) to detect patients with a high likelihood of lung cancer (LC) using CTs obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective study in the Krasnoyarsk region, Russia analyzed CTs of COVID-19 patients using the automated algorithm, Chest-IRA by AIRA Labs. Pulmonary nodules larger than 100 mm3 were identified by the AI and assessed by four radiologists, who categorized them into three groups: &#34;high probability of LC&#34;, &#34;insufficiently convincing evidence of LC&#34;, &#34;without evidence of LC&#34;. The study also estimated the economic impact of the AI by considering labor costs and savings on treatment for patients in the early stages compared to late stages, taking into account the saved life years and their potential contribution to the gross regional product. Results: An AI identified lung nodules in 484 out of 10,500 chest CTs, with 252 cases having high and intermediate probabilities of LC. Among 100 histologically verified LC cases, 35 were in stages I-II and 65 were in stages III-IV. Using AI instead of CT review by radiologists will save 2.43 million rubles (23,786 EUR/ 26690 USD/ 196,536 CNY) in direct salary, with expected savings to the regional budget of 8.22 million rubles (80,463 EUR/ 90,466 USD/ 666,162 CNY). The financial equivalent of the life years saved was 173.25 million rubles (1,695,892 EUR/ 1905750 USD/ 14,033,250 CNY). The total effect over five years is estimated at 183.9 million rubles (1,800,142 EUR/ 2,022,907 USD/ 14,895,949 CNY). Conclusion: Using AI to evaluate large volumes of chest CTs done for reasons unrelated to lung cancer screening may facilitate early and cost-effective detection of incidental pulmonary nodules that might otherwise be missed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) poses significant morbidity, underscoring the need for effective, non-invasive inflammatory assessment using magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This literature review evaluates recent publications on deep learning&#39;s role in enhancing MRE segmentation, image quality, and visualization of inflammatory activity related to CD. We searched MEDLINE/PUBMED for studies that reported the use of deep learning algorithms for assessment of CD activity. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Five eligible studies, encompassing 468 subjects, were identified. Our study suggests that diverse deep learning applications, including image quality enhancement, bowel segmentation, and motility measurement are useful and promising for CD assessment. However, most of the studies are preliminary, retrospective studies, and have a high risk of bias in at least one category. Future research is needed to assess how automated deep learning can impact patient care, especially when considering the increasing integration of these models into hospital systems.</p>
