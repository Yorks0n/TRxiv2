In this study, we investigate the utility of radiomic biomarkers for prediction of lesion-specific treatment resistance in multi metastatic leiomyosarcoma patients. Using a dataset of n=202 lung metastases (LM) from n=80 patients with 1648 pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) radiomics features and LM progression determined from follow-up CT, we developed a radiomic model to predict the progression of each lesion. Repeat experiments assessed the relative predictive performance across LM volume groups. Lesion-specific radiomic models indicate up to a 5-fold increase in predictive capacity compared with a no-skill classifier, with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.79 for the most precise model (FDR = 0.01). Precision varied by administered drug and LM volume. The effect of LM volume was controlled by removing radiomic features at a volume-correlation coefficient threshold of 0.20. Predicting lesion-specific responses using radiomic features represents a novel strategy by which to assess treatment response that acknowledges biological diversity within metastatic subclones, which could facilitate management strategies involving selective ablation of resistant clones in the setting of systemic therapy.

Performance of such models is often affected by potential variabilities stemming from independent protocols for data generation, imaging equipment, radiology artifacts, and demographic distributional shifts. Domain generalization (DG) frameworks have the potential to overcome these issues by learning signal from one or more source domains that can be transferable to unseen target domains. We developed an approach that leverages model interpretability as a means to improve generalizability of classification models across multiple cohorts. Using MRI scans and clinical diagnosis obtained from four independent cohorts (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 1, 821), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 304), the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 661), and the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 4, 647)), we trained a deep neural network that used model-identified regions of disease relevance to inform model training. We trained a classifier to distinguish persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) by aligning class-wise attention with a unified visual saliency prior computed offline per class over all training data. Our proposed method competes with state-of-the-art methods with improved correlation with postmortem histology, thus grounding our findings with gold standard evidence and paving a way towards validating DG frameworks.\n",
