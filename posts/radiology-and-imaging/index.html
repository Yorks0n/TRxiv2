  "articleBody": " Magnetic susceptibility is predictive of future clinical severity in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Thomas, G. E. C.; Hannaway, N.; Zarkali, A.; Shmueli, K.; Weil, R.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292555\nDementia is common in Parkinsons disease, but there is wide variation in its timing. With the emergence of disease modifying treatments in neurodegeneration, there is increasing need to detect and treat disease at the earliest stages and to monitor disease progression. A critical gap in Parkinsons disease is the lack of quantifiable markers of progression, and methods to identify early stages. Until recently, MRI has had limited sensitivity to detect or track changes relating to Parkinsons dementia, but advanced techniques, especially quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) which is sensitive to brain tissue iron, show potential for these purposes. So far, QSM, applied to cognition in Parkinsons, has only been investigated in detail in cross-sectional cohorts. Here we present a longitudinal study throughout the brain using QSM in Parkinsons disease. We included 59 Parkinsons patients (with no dementia at study onset), and 22 controls, at baseline and after 3-year follow-up. Participants underwent detailed assessments of motor and cognitive severity at both timepoints. We found that increased magnetic susceptibility values in right temporal cortex and right putamen in patients were associated with poorer cognition at baseline. Strikingly, increased baseline susceptibility values within right temporal cortex, nucleus basalis of Meynert and putamen in patients were associated with greater cognitive severity after 3-year follow-up; and increased baseline susceptibility in basal ganglia, substantia nigra, red nucleus, insular cortex and dentate nucleus in patients were associated with greater motor severity after 3-year follow-up. We further found that after 3-years, increased follow-up susceptibility in these regions was associated with increased follow-up cognitive and motor severity, with further involvement of hippocampus relating to cognitive severity. However, region of interest analyses revealed that, in cortical regions, increases in paramagnetic susceptibility relating to iron could not alone explain the associations with increased clinical severity that were observed; and, similar to other studies, we did not find consistent increases in susceptibility within the 3-year follow-up period. Our study suggests that QSM has predictive sensitivity to detect changes in clinical severity many months prior to overt cognitive involvement in Parkinsons. However, it also suggests that susceptibility within brain tissue over time may relate to changes in tissue composition other than iron concentration, such as in the relative proportion of myelin. Whilst our findings open the door for QSM to detect patients at the earliest stages of Parkinsons dementia, we will require additional tissue metrics to augment the interpretation QSM, such that it can be used robustly in clinical practice or to provide outcome measures in therapeutic trials for disease modifying treatments in neurodegeneration.\nFully automated brain metastases segmentation using T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR images before and after Stereotactic Radiosurgery\nAuthors: Kanakarajan, H.; De Baene, W.; Hanssens, P.; Sitskoorn, M.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292387\nBackgroundBrain metastases (BM) represent the most common intracranial tumor in adults. An estimated 20% of all patients with cancer will develop BM. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a major treatment option for BM. For SRS treatment planning and outcome evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are acquired before and at multiple stages during the follow-up. Accurate segmentation of brain tumors on MRI is crucial for treatment planning and response evaluation. Detection and segmentation of BM is a tedious and time-consuming task for many radiologists that could be optimized with machine learning methods. Previous studies evaluated the segmentation performance of several deep learning algorithms, but focused mainly on training and testing the models on the planning MR images only. The purpose of this study was to investigate a well-known deep learning approach (nnU-Net) for BM segmentation and to evaluate its performance on both planning MR images and follow-up MR images based on training on planning MR images only and testing with both planning MR and follow-up MR images. MethodPre-treatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted brain MRIs(i.e. the planning MRI) were collected retrospectively for 263 patients with BM. Scans were made as part of clinical care at the Gamma Knife Center of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (Tilburg, the Netherlands). This total of 263 patients were split into 203 patients for model training/validation and 60 patients for testing. For these 60 patients used for testing, the post treatment contrast-enhanced follow-up T1-weighted brain MRI scans(i.e. follow-up MRI) were also retrospectively collected. These 60 patients who were part of the testing set are from the set of patients included in the Cognition And Radiation Study A(CAR-Study A) at ETZ. The follow-up (FU) scans were made at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 21 months after treatment. The nnU-Net model was trained with the planning MR images, and then tested separately against the planning and follow-up MR images. ResultsWhen tested with planning MR images, the model obtained a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.940, a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.065 and a sensitivity of 0.934. When tested with the follow-up MR images 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 21 months after treatment, the model obtained, respectively, a DSC of 0.759, 0.667, 0.604, 0.589, 0.666 and 0.574, an FNR of 0.288, 0.379, 0.445, 0.470, 0.409, and 0.487 and a sensitivity of 0.711, 0.620, 0.554, 0.529, 0.590, and 0.512. ConclusionThe model achieved a good performance score for planning MR images. The nnU-Net model can automatically detect and segment brain metastases with high sensitivity, and low FNR. Though there is a decline in the DSC and an increase in the FNR of the model for the follow-up MR images, the algorithm could be a beneficial tool for clinicians and assist them for diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment response evaluations during follow-ups of BM patients.\n",

The nnU-Net model was trained with the planning MR images, and then tested separately against the planning and follow-up MR images.

ResultsWhen tested with planning MR images, the model obtained a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.940, a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.065 and a sensitivity of 0.934. When tested with the follow-up MR images 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 21 months after treatment, the model obtained, respectively, a DSC of 0.759, 0.667, 0.604, 0.589, 0.666 and 0.574, an FNR of 0.288, 0.379, 0.445, 0.470, 0.409, and 0.487 and a sensitivity of 0.711, 0.620, 0.554, 0.529, 0.590, and 0.512.

ConclusionThe model achieved a good performance score for planning MR images. The nnU-Net model can automatically detect and segment brain metastases with high sensitivity, and low FNR. Though there is a decline in the DSC and an increase in the FNR of the model for the follow-up MR images, the algorithm could be a beneficial tool for clinicians and assist them for diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment response evaluations during follow-ups of BM patients.</p>
