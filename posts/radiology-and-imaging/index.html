Although typical chest CT findings have been discussed thoroughly in the literature throughout the pandemic, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of the atypical conclusions during the start of the Omicron variant insurgency and compare the results to studies conducted before its outbreak. Methods606 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in this study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria during January and February 2022. Demographic information of patients, including age and sex, was recorded. The computed tomography (CT) examination was carried out using a 100-slice scanner (Philips Brilliance 6 CT Scanner). One radiology attending and one resident evaluated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients for atypical pulmonary CT findings. The obtained data were evaluated using R software version 4.1.1. Results55% of patients were female, and the median age was 56 (IQR: 42, 69) 59% of patients had atypical findings on their pulmonary CT examination. These findings showed that pleural abnormalities were the most frequent atypical findings, with pleural thickening being the most common (17%). The double halo sign represented the least frequent atypical sign (0.2%). ConclusionAtypical findings were more prevalent in this study than its predecessors, while we acknowledge that other factors, such as study design and patient population, could have impacted it. The presence of atypical signs generally was not correlated with specific demographic groups, while some of these signs were more frequent in some groups.\nDeep learning on CT scans to predict checkpoint inhibitor treatment outcomes in advanced melanoma\nAuthors: ter Maat, L.

However, a significant fraction of patients does not experience benefit from this treatment, that is also associated with potentially severe toxicity and high costs. Previous research has not yet resulted in adequate biomarkers that can predict treatment outcomes. The present work is the first to investigate the value of deep learning on computed tomography (CT) imaging of melanoma lesions for predicting checkpoint inhibitor treatment outcomes in advanced melanoma. MethodsAdult patients that were treated with first line anti-PD1 {+/-} anti-CTLA4 therapy for unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma were retrospectively identified from ten participating centers. Up to five representative lesions were segmented volumetrically on baseline CT; a deep learning model (DLM) was trained on the corresponding volumes to predict clinical benefit, defined as stable disease for a minimum of six months, or response at any time during follow-up. Optimal hyperparameters and model types (Densenet, Efficientnet, Squeeze-Excitation ResNet, ResNeXt) were iteratively explored. The DLM was compared to a model of previously identified clinical predictors (presence of liver and brain metastasis, level of lactate dehydrogenase, performance status and number of affected organs), and a combination model consisting of both clinical predictors and the DLM. ResultsA total of 730 eligible patients with 2722 lesions were included. Rate of clinical benefit was 59.6%. The selected deep learning model was a Squeeze-Excitation ResNet with random initialization, trained with the Adam optimizer. The DLM reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.607 [95% CI 0.565 - 0.648]. In comparison, a model of clinical predictors reached an AUROC of 0.635 [95% CI 0.592 - 0.678]. The combination model reached an AUROC of 0.635 [95% CI 0.595 - 0.676]. None of the differences in AUROC were statistically significant. The output of the DLM was significantly correlated with four of the five input variables of the clinical model. DiscussionAlthough the DLM reached a statistically significant discriminative value, it was unable to improve over previously identified clinical predictors. The most likely cause is that the DLM learns to detect a lesions size and organ location, which is information that is already present in the clinical model. Given the substantial sample size and extensive hyperparameter optimization, this indicates that the predictive value of CT imaging of lesions for checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma is likely limited. The present work shows that the assessment over known clinical predictors is an essential step for imaging-based prediction and brings important nuance to the almost exclusively positive findings in this field.\n",
