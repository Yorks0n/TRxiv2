SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment. MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment. ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS. DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.\nThe virtual multiple sclerosis patient: on the clinical-radiological paradox\nAuthors: Sorrentino, P.; Pathak, A.; Ziaeemehr, A.; Troisi Lopez, E.; Cipriano, L.; Romano, A.; Sparaco, M.; Quarantelli, M.; Banerjee, A.; Sorrentino, G.; Hashemi, M.; Jirsa, V.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.23299274\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, the presence of structural MRI lesions, and a no better explanation criterion. The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the clinico-radiological paradox. The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables andlesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the clinico-radiological paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.\nIntra-cellular accumulation of amyloids is a marker of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Caramello, A.; Fancy, N.; Tournerie, C.; Eklund, M.; Chau, V.; Adair, E.; Papageorgopoulou, M.; Jackson, J.; Hardy, J.; Matthews, P. M.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298911\nCharacterisation of vulnerable neurons that die earliest with Alzheimers disease (AD) could provide rationale treatment targets to slow or prevent neurodegeneration. We used imaging mass cytometry to identify the neuronal sub-types lost earliest in AD and explored associated mechanisms with paired single nuclear transcriptomics in post-mortem middle temporal gyri from diseased donors. We found L5-6 RORB+ and L3-6 GAD1+ neurons show the greatest loss in AD. These neuronal subtypes also accumulated {beta}-amyloids intracellularly. By contrast, pTau+ tangles progressively formed in a distinct L3 RORB+GPC5+ subtype that appeared resilient. Both astrocytes and microglia expressed reactive phenotype markers with AD and reactive microglia were spatially associated with vulnerable neurons. RORB+ neuronal sub-types accumulating either amyloids or pTau showed increased expression of autophagy-related genes. In conclusion, we identified layer- and neuronal subtype-specific loss with AD that suggest intrinsic autophagy-related defects associated with intracellular accumulation of {beta}-amyloids, rather than pTau, may initiate early neurodegeneration.\nDelayed cortical engagement associated with balance dysfunction after stroke\nAuthors: Palmer, J. A.; Payne, A. M.; Mirdamadi, J. L.; Ting, L. H.; Borich, M. R.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299035\nCortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.\nMedial temporal lobe hyperconnectivity is key to Alzheimer's disease: Insight from physiological aging to dementia\nAuthors: Chauveau, L.; Landeau, B.; Dautricourt, S.; Turpin, A.-L.; Delarue, M.; Hebert, O.; de La Sayette, V.; Chetelat, G.; de Flores, R.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298948\nCuring Alzheimers disease (AD) remains hampered by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and progression. Dysfunction within medial temporal lobe networks may provide key insights, as AD proteins seem to propagate specifically through the anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) systems. Using monocentric longitudinal data from 267 participants spanning physiological aging to the full AD continuum, we found that advancing age was associated with decreased PM connectivity and increased AT connectivity over adult life. When specifically assessing AD-relevant connectivity changes, all AD-associated clinicopathological features, including elevated amyloid burden, AD-typical glucose hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, greater cognitive impairment and faster progression from MCI to AD-dementia, were consistently linked to AT hyperconnectivity in healthy to AD-demented older adults. Our comprehensive approach allowed us to reveal that excessive connectivity within the AT network is a pivotal mechanism catalysing pathological process and progression of AD. Such findings hold promise for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies targeting these specific network alterations.\nLanguage Uncovers Visuospatial Dysfunction in Posterior Cortical Atrophy: A Natural Language Processing Approach\nAuthors: Rezaii, N.; Hochberg, D.; Quimby, M.; Wong, B.; McGinnis, S.; Dickerson, B. C.; Putcha, D.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298864\nIntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease. MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA. ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy. DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.\nMotor unit firing rate modulation is more impaired during flexion synergy-driven contractions of the biceps brachii in chronic stroke.\nAuthors: Beauchamp, J. A.; Hassan, A. S.; McPherson, L. M.; Negro, F.; Pearcey, G. E. P.; Cummings, M.; Heckman, C.; Dewald, J. P. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298905\nFollowing a hemiparetic stroke, individuals exhibit altered motor unit firing patterns during voluntary muscle contractions, including impairments in firing rate modulation and recruitment. These individuals also exhibit abnormal muscle coactivation through multi-joint synergies (e.g., flexion synergy). Here, we investigate whether motor unit firing activity during flexion synergy-driven contractions of the paretic biceps brachii differs from that of voluntary contractions and use these differences to predict changes in descending motor commands. To accomplish this, we characterized motor unit firing patterns of the biceps brachii in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke during voluntary isometric elbow flexion contractions in the paretic and non-paretic limbs, as well as during contractions driven by voluntary effort and by flexion synergy expression in the paretic limb. We observed significant reductions in motor unit firing rate modulation from the non-paretic to paretic limb (non-paretic - paretic: 0.14 pps/%MVT, 95% CI: [0.09 0.19]) that were further reduced during synergy-driven contractions (voluntary paretic - synergy driven: 0.19 pps/%MVT, 95% CI: [0.14 0.25]). Moreover, using recently developed metrics, we evaluated how a stroke-induced reliance on indirect motor pathways alters the inputs that motor units receive and revealed progressive increases in neuromodulatory and inhibitory drive to the motor pool in the paretic limb, with the changes greatest during synergy-driven contractions. These findings suggest that an interplay between heightened neuromodulatory drive and alterations in inhibitory command structure may account for the observed motor unit impairments, further illuminating underlying neural mechanisms involved in the flexion synergy and its impact on motor unit firing patterns post-stroke.\nA Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis\nAuthors: Schweickart, A.; Batra, R.; Neth, B. J.; Martino, C.; Shenhav, L.; Zhang, A. R.; Shi, P.; Karu, N.; Huynh, K.; Meikle, P. J.; Schimmel, L.; Dilmore, A. H.; Blennow, K.; Zetterberg, H.; Blach, C.; Dorrestein, P. C.; Knight, R.; Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project Consortium, ; Craft, S.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; Krumsiek, J.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298990\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.\nAdversarial Learning for MRI Reconstruction and Classification of Cognitively Impaired Individuals\nAuthors: Zhou, X.; Balachandra, A. R.; Romano, M. F.; Chin, S. P.; Au, R.; Kolachalama, V. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298477\nGame theory-inspired deep learning using a generative adversarial network provides an environment to competitively interact and accomplish a goal. In the context of medical imaging, most work has focused on achieving single tasks such as improving image resolution, segmenting images, and correcting motion artifacts. We present a dual-objective adversarial learning framework that simultaneously (1) reconstructs higher quality brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that (2) retain disease-specific imaging features critical for predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimers disease (AD). We obtained 3-Tesla, T1-weighted brain MRIs of participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=342) and the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC, N=190) datasets. We simulated MRIs with missing data by removing 50% of sagittal slices from the original scans (i.e., diced scans). The generator was trained to reconstruct brain MRIs using the diced scans as input. We introduced a classifier into the GAN architecture to discriminate between stable (i.e., sMCI) and progressive MCI (i.e., pMCI) based on the generated images to facilitate encoding of AD-related information during reconstruction. The framework was trained using ADNI data and externally validated on NACC data. In the NACC cohort, generated images had better image quality than the diced scans (SSIM: 0.553 {+/-} 0.116 versus 0.348 {+/-} 0.108). Furthermore, a classifier utilizing the generated images distinguished pMCI from sMCI more accurately than with the diced scans (F1-score: 0.634 {+/-} 0.019 versus 0.573 {+/-} 0.028). Competitive deep learning has potential to facilitate disease-oriented image reconstruction in those at risk of developing Alzheimers disease.\nMapping the Interplay of Atrial Fibrillation, Brain Structure and Cognitive Dysfunction\nAuthors: Petersen, M.; Chevalier, C.; Naegele, F. L.; Ingwersen, T.; Omidvarnia, A.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Patil, K.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Schnabel, R. B.; Kirchhof, P.; Schlemm, E.; Cheng, B.; Thomalla, G.; Jensen, M.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298431\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The investigation of the cognitive sequelae and alterations of brain structure linked to AF is crucial to help address ensuing health care needs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging analysis of 1335 stroke-free individuals with AF (30% women, average age 69.1 years) and compared them with 2683 demographically and cardiovascular risk-matched controls (31% women, average age 69.1 years). Primary study outcomes were neuropsychological test scores and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of gray matter morphology, gray and white matter microstructure, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load. Our analysis identified deficits in attention/executive function, information processing speed and reasoning in individuals with AF. These cognitive impairments were accompanied by a complex imaging profile suggestive of small vessel pathology: (1) reduced cortical thickness and gray matter volume in areas including primary motor, somatosensory and visual cortices as well as the orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and temporal cortices; (2) increased extracellular free-water content in the anterior cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and precuneus; (3) widespread microstructural anomalies in the cerebral white matter, marked by lower fractional anisotropy (FA), higher mean diffusivity (MD) and extracellular free-water, and a higher burden of markers of small vessel disease (WMH load and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity). Crucially, brain structural differences statistically mediated the link between AF and cognitive performance. By integrating a multimodal analysis approach with extensive clinical and MRI data, our study highlights small vessel pathology as a possible unifying link between AF, cognitive decline and abnormal brain structure. These insights can inform diagnostic approaches and motivate the ongoing implementation of effective therapeutic strategies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesReport a case series of new onset small fiber neuropathy (SFN) after COVID-19 treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment.

MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment.

ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS.

DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, the presence of structural MRI lesions, and a no better explanation criterion. The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the clinico-radiological paradox. The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables andlesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the clinico-radiological paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Characterisation of vulnerable neurons that die earliest with Alzheimers disease (AD) could provide rationale treatment targets to slow or prevent neurodegeneration. We used imaging mass cytometry to identify the neuronal sub-types lost earliest in AD and explored associated mechanisms with paired single nuclear transcriptomics in post-mortem middle temporal gyri from diseased donors. We found L5-6 RORB&#43; and L3-6 GAD1&#43; neurons show the greatest loss in AD. These neuronal subtypes also accumulated {beta}-amyloids intracellularly. By contrast, pTau&#43; tangles progressively formed in a distinct L3 RORB&#43;GPC5&#43; subtype that appeared resilient. Both astrocytes and microglia expressed reactive phenotype markers with AD and reactive microglia were spatially associated with vulnerable neurons. RORB&#43; neuronal sub-types accumulating either amyloids or pTau showed increased expression of autophagy-related genes. In conclusion, we identified layer- and neuronal subtype-specific loss with AD that suggest intrinsic autophagy-related defects associated with intracellular accumulation of {beta}-amyloids, rather than pTau, may initiate early neurodegeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Curing Alzheimers disease (AD) remains hampered by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and progression. Dysfunction within medial temporal lobe networks may provide key insights, as AD proteins seem to propagate specifically through the anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) systems. Using monocentric longitudinal data from 267 participants spanning physiological aging to the full AD continuum, we found that advancing age was associated with decreased PM connectivity and increased AT connectivity over adult life. When specifically assessing AD-relevant connectivity changes, all AD-associated clinicopathological features, including elevated amyloid burden, AD-typical glucose hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, greater cognitive impairment and faster progression from MCI to AD-dementia, were consistently linked to AT hyperconnectivity in healthy to AD-demented older adults. Our comprehensive approach allowed us to reveal that excessive connectivity within the AT network is a pivotal mechanism catalysing pathological process and progression of AD. Such findings hold promise for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies targeting these specific network alterations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease.

MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA.

ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy.

DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Following a hemiparetic stroke, individuals exhibit altered motor unit firing patterns during voluntary muscle contractions, including impairments in firing rate modulation and recruitment. These individuals also exhibit abnormal muscle coactivation through multi-joint synergies (e.g., flexion synergy). Here, we investigate whether motor unit firing activity during flexion synergy-driven contractions of the paretic biceps brachii differs from that of voluntary contractions and use these differences to predict changes in descending motor commands. To accomplish this, we characterized motor unit firing patterns of the biceps brachii in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke during voluntary isometric elbow flexion contractions in the paretic and non-paretic limbs, as well as during contractions driven by voluntary effort and by flexion synergy expression in the paretic limb. We observed significant reductions in motor unit firing rate modulation from the non-paretic to paretic limb (non-paretic - paretic: 0.14 pps/%MVT, 95% CI: [0.09 0.19]) that were further reduced during synergy-driven contractions (voluntary paretic - synergy driven: 0.19 pps/%MVT, 95% CI: [0.14 0.25]). Moreover, using recently developed metrics, we evaluated how a stroke-induced reliance on indirect motor pathways alters the inputs that motor units receive and revealed progressive increases in neuromodulatory and inhibitory drive to the motor pool in the paretic limb, with the changes greatest during synergy-driven contractions. These findings suggest that an interplay between heightened neuromodulatory drive and alterations in inhibitory command structure may account for the observed motor unit impairments, further illuminating underlying neural mechanisms involved in the flexion synergy and its impact on motor unit firing patterns post-stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Game theory-inspired deep learning using a generative adversarial network provides an environment to competitively interact and accomplish a goal. In the context of medical imaging, most work has focused on achieving single tasks such as improving image resolution, segmenting images, and correcting motion artifacts. We present a dual-objective adversarial learning framework that simultaneously (1) reconstructs higher quality brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that (2) retain disease-specific imaging features critical for predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimers disease (AD). We obtained 3-Tesla, T1-weighted brain MRIs of participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=342) and the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC, N=190) datasets. We simulated MRIs with missing data by removing 50% of sagittal slices from the original scans (i.e., diced scans). The generator was trained to reconstruct brain MRIs using the diced scans as input. We introduced a classifier into the GAN architecture to discriminate between stable (i.e., sMCI) and progressive MCI (i.e., pMCI) based on the generated images to facilitate encoding of AD-related information during reconstruction. The framework was trained using ADNI data and externally validated on NACC data. In the NACC cohort, generated images had better image quality than the diced scans (SSIM: 0.553 {&#43;/-} 0.116 versus 0.348 {&#43;/-} 0.108). Furthermore, a classifier utilizing the generated images distinguished pMCI from sMCI more accurately than with the diced scans (F1-score: 0.634 {&#43;/-} 0.019 versus 0.573 {&#43;/-} 0.028). Competitive deep learning has potential to facilitate disease-oriented image reconstruction in those at risk of developing Alzheimers disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The investigation of the cognitive sequelae and alterations of brain structure linked to AF is crucial to help address ensuing health care needs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging analysis of 1335 stroke-free individuals with AF (30% women, average age 69.1 years) and compared them with 2683 demographically and cardiovascular risk-matched controls (31% women, average age 69.1 years). Primary study outcomes were neuropsychological test scores and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of gray matter morphology, gray and white matter microstructure, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load. Our analysis identified deficits in attention/executive function, information processing speed and reasoning in individuals with AF. These cognitive impairments were accompanied by a complex imaging profile suggestive of small vessel pathology: (1) reduced cortical thickness and gray matter volume in areas including primary motor, somatosensory and visual cortices as well as the orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and temporal cortices; (2) increased extracellular free-water content in the anterior cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and precuneus; (3) widespread microstructural anomalies in the cerebral white matter, marked by lower fractional anisotropy (FA), higher mean diffusivity (MD) and extracellular free-water, and a higher burden of markers of small vessel disease (WMH load and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity). Crucially, brain structural differences statistically mediated the link between AF and cognitive performance. By integrating a multimodal analysis approach with extensive clinical and MRI data, our study highlights small vessel pathology as a possible unifying link between AF, cognitive decline and abnormal brain structure. These insights can inform diagnostic approaches and motivate the ongoing implementation of effective therapeutic strategies.</p>
