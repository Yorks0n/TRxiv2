We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

C.; Kivisakk, P.; Hammerschlag, B. L.; Bolling, A.; Trombetta, B. A.; Devitte-McKee, K.; Ford, A. M.; Sather, L.; Duffy, G.; Rivera, A.; Gerber, J.; McManus, A. J.; Minikel, E. V.; Arnold, S. E.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300042\nImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset. ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls. Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study. Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma. ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints. Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset? FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.\nTowards cascading genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Altmann, A.; Aksman, L. M.; Oxtoby, N. P.; Young, A.; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initative (ADNI), ; Alexander, D. C.; Barkhof, F.; Shoai, M.; Hardy, J.; Schott, J. M.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300062\nBackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Here we investigate whether genetic risk for AD contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. MethodsAmyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In 425 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T-status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (PRS; beyond APOE) to convert to A+T-status (68 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 402 participants with A+T-status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (46 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. ResultsFor progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.65-4.45; P\u003c0.001), while PRS did not (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.82-1.40; P=0.65). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.65 95% CI: 1.05-2.59; P=0.030), while the PRS showed an increased contribution (HR=1.67; 95% CI:1.22-2.28; P=0.0014). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.81; 95% CI: 1.14-6.91; P=0.025) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.5; 95% CI: 0.75-2.99; P=0.25). ConclusionThe genetic risk for LOAD unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to AD as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.\nPlasma neurofilament light chain is elevated in Niemann-Pick Type C but glial fibrillary acidic protein is not\nAuthors: Eratne, D.; Lewis, C.; Loi, S. M.; Chiu, W.-H.; Blennow, K. M.; Zetterberg, H.; Santillo, A. F.; Velakoulis, D.; Walterfang, M.; The MiND Study Group, Score: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299884\nOBJECTIVENiemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls. METHODSPatients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges. RESULTSPlasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p\u003c0.001), and reference ranges (all \u003e98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL). DISCUSSIONThe study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.\nA Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis\nAuthors: Schweickart, A.; Batra, R.; Neth, B. J.; Martino, C.; Shenhav, L.; Zhang, A. R.; Shi, P.; Karu, N.; Huynh, K.; Meikle, P. J.; Schimmel, L.; Dilmore, A. H.; Blennow, K.; Zetterberg, H.; Blach, C.; Dorrestein, P. C.; Knight, R.; Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project Consortium, ; Craft, S.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; Krumsiek, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298990\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.\nCortical microstructure and hemispheric specialization - a diffusion-imaging analysis in younger and older adults\nAuthors: Wrobel, P. P.; Braass, H.; Frey, B. M.; Bönstrup, M.; Guder, S.; Frontzkowski, L. K.; Feldheim, J. F.; Cheng, B.; Rathi, Y.; Pasternak, O.; Thomalla, G.; Koerte, I. K.; Shenton, M. E.; Gerloff, C.; Quandt, F.; Higgen, F. L.; Schulz, R.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300148\nCharacterizing cortical plasticity becomes increasingly important for identifying compensatory mechanisms and structural reserve in the aging population. While cortical thickness (CT) largely contributed to systems neuroscience, it incompletely informs about the underlying neuroplastic pathophysiology. In turn, microstructural characteristics may correspond to atrophy mechanisms in a more sensitive way, indicating a potentially necessary paradigm shift in neuroimaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure, is inversely related to cortical histologic complexity. Axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) are assumed to be linked to density of structures oriented perpendicular and parallel to cortical surface respectively. We hypothesized (1) that cortical DTI will reveal microstructural correlates for hemispheric specialization, particularly in the language and motor systems and (2) that lateralization of cortical DTI parameters will show an age effect, paralleling age-related changes in activation, especially in the prefrontal cortex. We re-analyzed data of healthy younger and older adult participants (n=91). DTI measures and CT were extracted from Destrieux atlas regions. Diffusion measures showed lateralization in specialized motor, language, visual, auditory, and inferior parietal cortices. Age-dependent increased lateralization was observed for DTI measures in the prefrontal, angular, superior temporal, and lateral occipital cortex. CT did not show any age-dependent alterations in lateralization. Our observations argue that cortical DTI is able to capture correlates of microstructural properties associated with functional specialization, resembling findings from histology. Age effects on diffusion measures in the integrative prefrontal and parietal areas may shed novel light on the atrophy-related plasticity in healthy aging. Significance statementCortical thickness significantly contributed to systems neuroscience research related to cortical neuroplasticity. However, regarding the underlying cortical microstructure it remains an unspecific measure. With a strong lateralization in diffusion measures but not in thickness in specialized areas we demonstrate that cortical diffusion MRI is suitable to grasp microstructural features linked to specialization already described in histology literature. The findings in the lateralization of prefrontal and parietal cortical features may reflect age-related dynamic in cerebral activation. These results indicate the great potential of cortical diffusion tensor imaging in neuroscience and may even emphasize a necessary paradigm shift from the assessment of cortical macrostructure towards cortical microstructure for a better understanding of neuroplasticity and structure-function relationships in health and disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">PurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities.

MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded.

Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers.

ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset.

ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls.

Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study.

Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma.

ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints.

Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (&#43;) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Here we investigate whether genetic risk for AD contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect.

MethodsAmyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In 425 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T-status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (PRS; beyond APOE) to convert to A&#43;T-status (68 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 402 participants with A&#43;T-status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A&#43;T&#43; (46 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education.

ResultsFor progression from A-T- to A&#43;T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.65-4.45; P&lt;0.001), while PRS did not (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.82-1.40; P=0.65). Conversely, for the transition from A&#43;T- to A&#43;T&#43;, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.65 95% CI: 1.05-2.59; P=0.030), while the PRS showed an increased contribution (HR=1.67; 95% CI:1.22-2.28; P=0.0014). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.81; 95% CI: 1.14-6.91; P=0.025) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.5; 95% CI: 0.75-2.99; P=0.25).

ConclusionThe genetic risk for LOAD unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to AD as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVENiemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls.

METHODSPatients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges.

RESULTSPlasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), and reference ranges (all &gt;98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL).

DISCUSSIONThe study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Characterizing cortical plasticity becomes increasingly important for identifying compensatory mechanisms and structural reserve in the aging population. While cortical thickness (CT) largely contributed to systems neuroscience, it incompletely informs about the underlying neuroplastic pathophysiology. In turn, microstructural characteristics may correspond to atrophy mechanisms in a more sensitive way, indicating a potentially necessary paradigm shift in neuroimaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure, is inversely related to cortical histologic complexity. Axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) are assumed to be linked to density of structures oriented perpendicular and parallel to cortical surface respectively. We hypothesized (1) that cortical DTI will reveal microstructural correlates for hemispheric specialization, particularly in the language and motor systems and (2) that lateralization of cortical DTI parameters will show an age effect, paralleling age-related changes in activation, especially in the prefrontal cortex. We re-analyzed data of healthy younger and older adult participants (n=91). DTI measures and CT were extracted from Destrieux atlas regions. Diffusion measures showed lateralization in specialized motor, language, visual, auditory, and inferior parietal cortices. Age-dependent increased lateralization was observed for DTI measures in the prefrontal, angular, superior temporal, and lateral occipital cortex. CT did not show any age-dependent alterations in lateralization. Our observations argue that cortical DTI is able to capture correlates of microstructural properties associated with functional specialization, resembling findings from histology. Age effects on diffusion measures in the integrative prefrontal and parietal areas may shed novel light on the atrophy-related plasticity in healthy aging.

Significance statementCortical thickness significantly contributed to systems neuroscience research related to cortical neuroplasticity. However, regarding the underlying cortical microstructure it remains an unspecific measure. With a strong lateralization in diffusion measures but not in thickness in specialized areas we demonstrate that cortical diffusion MRI is suitable to grasp microstructural features linked to specialization already described in histology literature. The findings in the lateralization of prefrontal and parietal cortical features may reflect age-related dynamic in cerebral activation. These results indicate the great potential of cortical diffusion tensor imaging in neuroscience and may even emphasize a necessary paradigm shift from the assessment of cortical macrostructure towards cortical microstructure for a better understanding of neuroplasticity and structure-function relationships in health and disease.</p>
