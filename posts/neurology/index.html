M.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292164\nInvestigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects). Each scan was accompanied by a plasma sample to quantify plasma drug levels and estimate brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, as well as a rating of subjective drug intensity. We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.\nCirculating lipid profiles are associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of central biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Kim, J. P.; Nho, K.; Wang, T.; Huynh, K.; Arnold, M.; Risacher, S. L.; Bice, P. J.; Han, X.; Kristal, B. S.; Blach, C.; Baillie, R.; Kastenmuller, G.; Meikle, P. J.; Saykin, A. J.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ; for the Alzheimer's Disease Metabolomics Consortium, Score: 9.2, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291054\nInvestigating the association of lipidome profiles with central Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarkers, including amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N), can provide a holistic view between the lipidome and AD. We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal association analysis of serum lipidome profiles with AD biomarkers in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (N=1,395). We identified lipid species, classes, and network modules that were significantly associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of A/T/N biomarkers for AD. Notably, we identified the lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine (LPC(O)) as associated with \"A/N\" biomarkers at baseline at lipid species, class, and module levels. Also, GM3 ganglioside showed significant association with baseline levels and longitudinal changes of the \"N\" biomarkers at species and class levels. Our study of circulating lipids and central AD biomarkers enabled identification of lipids that play potential roles in the cascade of AD pathogenesis. Our results suggest dysregulation of lipid metabolic pathways as precursors to AD development and progression.\nOnline speech synthesis using a chronically implanted brain-computer interface in an individual with ALS\nAuthors: Angrick, M.; Luo, S.; Rabbani, Q.; Candrea, D. N.; Shah, S.; Milsap, G. W.; Anderson, W. S.; Gordon, C. R.; Rosenblatt, K. R.; Clawson, L.; Maragakis, N.; Tenore, F. V.; Fifer, M. S.; Hermansky, H.; Ramsey, N. F.; Crone, N. E.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.23291352\nRecent studies have shown that speech can be reconstructed and synthesized using only brain activity recorded with intracranial electrodes, but until now this has only been done using retrospective analyses of recordings from able-bodied patients temporarily implanted with electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Here, we report online synthesis of intelligible words using a chronically implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) in a clinical trial participant (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03567213) with dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We demonstrate a reliable BCI that synthesizes commands freely chosen and spoken by the user from a vocabulary of 6 keywords originally designed to allow intuitive selection of items on a communication board. Our results show for the first time that a speech-impaired individual with ALS can use a chronically implanted BCI to reliably produce synthesized words that are intelligible to human listeners while preserving the participants voice profile.\nResting-state background features demonstrate multidien cycles in long-term EEG device recordings\nAuthors: Ojemann, W. K. S.; Scheid, B. H.; Mouchtaris, S.; Lucas, A.; LaRocque, J. J.; Aguila, C.; Ashourvan, A.; Caciagli, L.; Davis, K. A.; Conrad, E. C.; Litt, B.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.23291521\nBackground: Longitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. Methods: We analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation. Results: Background EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p \u003c 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p \u003c 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.\nVagus nerve inflammation contributes to dysautonomia in COVID-19\nAuthors: Woo, M. S.; Shafiq, M.; Fitzek, A.; Dottermusch, M.; Altmeppen, H.; Mohammadi, B.; Mayer, C.; Bal, L. C.; Raich, L.; Matschke, J.; Krasemann, S.; Pfefferle, S.; Brehm, T. T. S.; Luetgehetmann, M.; Schaedler, J.; Addo, M. M.; Schulze Zur Wiesch, J.; Ondruschka, B.; Friese, M. A.; Glatzel, M.\nScore: 100.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291320\nDysautonomia has substantially impacted acute COVID-19 severity as well as symptom burden after recovery from COVID-19 (long COVID), yet the underlying causes remain unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.\nIdentification of commensal gut microbiota signatures as predictors of clinical severity and disease progression in multiple sclerosis\nAuthors: Montgomery, T. L.; Wang, Q.; Mirza, A.; Dwyer, D.; Wu, Q.; Dowling, C. A.; Martens, J. W.; Yang, J.; Krementsov, D. N.; Mao-Draayer, Y.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291875\nBackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Clinical presentation and disease course are highly heterogeneous. Typically, disease progression occurs over time and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of disability. The risk of developing MS is driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. How the commensal gut microbiota impacts disease severity and progression over time remains unknown. MethodsIn a longitudinal study, disability status and associated clinical features in 60 MS patients were tracked over 4.2 {+/-} 0.97 years, and the baseline fecal gut microbiome was characterized via 16S amplicon sequencing. Progressor status, defined as patients with an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were correlated with features of the gut microbiome to determine candidate microbiota associated with risk of MS disease progression. ResultsWe found no overt differences in microbial community diversity and overall structure between MS patients exhibiting disease progression and non-progressors. However, a total of 45 bacterial species were associated with worsening disease, including a marked depletion in Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with an expansion of Alloprevotella, Prevotella-9, and Rhodospirillales. Analysis of the metabolic potential of the inferred metagenome from taxa associated with progression revealed a significant enrichment in oxidative stress-inducing aerobic respiration at the expense of microbial vitamin K2 production (linked to Akkermansia), and a depletion in SCFA metabolism (linked to Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae). Further, statistical modeling demonstrated that microbiota composition and clinical features were sufficient to robustly predict disease progression. Additionally, we found that constipation, a frequent gastrointestinal comorbidity among MS patients, exhibited a divergent microbial signature compared with progressor status. ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the utility of the gut microbiome for predicting disease progression in MS. Further, analysis of the inferred metagenome revealed that oxidative stress, vitamin K2 and SCFAs are associated with progression.

        <p class="abstract">Investigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased  brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects).

We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of  brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Investigating the association of lipidome profiles with central Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarkers, including amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N), can provide a holistic view between the lipidome and AD. We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal association analysis of serum lipidome profiles with AD biomarkers in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (N=1,395). We identified lipid species, classes, and network modules that were significantly associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of A/T/N biomarkers for AD. Notably, we identified the lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine (LPC(O)) as associated with &#34;A/N&#34; biomarkers at baseline at lipid species, class, and module levels. Also, GM3 ganglioside showed significant association with baseline levels and longitudinal changes of the &#34;N&#34; biomarkers at species and class levels. Our study of circulating lipids and central AD biomarkers enabled identification of lipids that play potential roles in the cascade of AD pathogenesis. Our results suggest dysregulation of lipid metabolic pathways as precursors to AD development and progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent studies have shown that speech can be reconstructed and synthesized using only brain activity recorded with intracranial electrodes, but until now this has only been done using retrospective analyses of recordings from able-bodied patients temporarily implanted with electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Here, we report online synthesis of intelligible words using a chronically implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) in a clinical trial participant (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03567213) with dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We demonstrate a reliable BCI that synthesizes commands freely chosen and spoken by the user from a vocabulary of 6 keywords originally designed to allow intuitive selection of items on a communication board. Our results show for the first time that a speech-impaired individual with ALS can use a chronically implanted BCI to reliably produce synthesized words that are intelligible to human listeners while preserving the participants voice profile.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Longitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. Methods: We analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation. Results: Background EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p &lt; 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p &lt; 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysautonomia has substantially impacted acute COVID-19 severity as well as symptom burden after recovery from COVID-19 (long COVID), yet the underlying causes remain unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Clinical presentation and disease course are highly heterogeneous. Typically, disease progression occurs over time and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of disability. The risk of developing MS is driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. How the commensal gut microbiota impacts disease severity and progression over time remains unknown.

MethodsIn a longitudinal study, disability status and associated clinical features in 60 MS patients were tracked over 4.2 {&#43;/-} 0.97 years, and the baseline fecal gut microbiome was characterized via 16S amplicon sequencing. Progressor status, defined as patients with an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were correlated with features of the gut microbiome to determine candidate microbiota associated with risk of MS disease progression.

ResultsWe found no overt differences in microbial community diversity and overall structure between MS patients exhibiting disease progression and non-progressors. However, a total of 45 bacterial species were associated with worsening disease, including a marked depletion in Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with an expansion of Alloprevotella, Prevotella-9, and Rhodospirillales. Analysis of the metabolic potential of the inferred metagenome from taxa associated with progression revealed a significant enrichment in oxidative stress-inducing aerobic respiration at the expense of microbial vitamin K2 production (linked to Akkermansia), and a depletion in SCFA metabolism (linked to Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae). Further, statistical modeling demonstrated that microbiota composition and clinical features were sufficient to robustly predict disease progression. Additionally, we found that constipation, a frequent gastrointestinal comorbidity among MS patients, exhibited a divergent microbial signature compared with progressor status.

ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the utility of the gut microbiome for predicting disease progression in MS. Further, analysis of the inferred metagenome revealed that oxidative stress, vitamin K2 and SCFAs are associated with progression.
