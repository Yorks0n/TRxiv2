This scoping review describes state-of-the-art ML in ND research using MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Central (Cochrane), and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore. Included articles, published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, used patient data on Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, or Huntingtons disease that employed ML methods during primary analysis. One reviewer screened citations for inclusion; 5 conducted data extraction. For each article, we abstracted the type of ND; publication year; sample size; ML algorithm data type; primary clinical goal (disease diagnosis/prognosis/prediction of treatment effect); and ML method type. Quantitative and qualitative syntheses of the results were conducted. After screening 4,471 citations and searching 1,677 full-text articles, 1,485 articles were included. The number of articles using ML methods in ND research increased from 172 in 2016 to 490 in 2020, with most of those in Alzheimers disease. The most common data type was imaging data (46.9% of articles), followed by functional (20.6%), clinical (14.2%), biospecimen (6.2%), genetic (5.9%), electrophysiological (5.1%), and molecular (1.1%). Overall, 68.5% of imaging data studies were in Alzheimers disease and 75.9% of functional data studies were in Parkinsons disease. Disease diagnosis was the most common clinical aim in studies using ML methods (73.5%), followed by disease prognosis (21.4%) and prediction of treatment effect (13.5%). We extracted 2,734 ML methods, with support vector machine (n=651, 23.8%), random forest (n=310, 11.3%), and convolutional neural network (n=166, 6.1%) representing the majority. Finally, we identified 322 unique ML methods. There are opportunities for additional research using ML methods for disease prognosis and prediction of treatment effect. Addressing these utilization gaps will be important in future studies. Author SummaryFew state-of-the-art scientific updates have been targeted for broader readerships without indulging in technical jargon. We have learned a lot from Judea Pearl on how to put things into context and make them clear. In this review paper, we identify machine learning methods used in the realm of neurodegenerative diseases and describe how the use of these methods can be enhanced in neurodegenerative disease research.\nPersonalized chronic adaptive deep brain stimulation outperforms conventional stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Oehrn, C. R.; Cernera, S.; Hammer, L. H.; Shcherbakova, M.; Yao, J.; Hahn, A.; Wang, S.; Ostrem, J. L.; Little, S.; Starr, P. A.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293450\nDeep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of adaptive neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.\nThe circulating proteome and brain health: Mendelian randomisation and cross-sectional analyses\nAuthors: Walker, R. M.; Chong, M.; Perrot, N.; Pigeyre, M.; Gadd, D. A.; Stolicyn, A.; Shi, L.; Campbell, A.; Shen, X.; Whalley, H. C.; Nevado Holgado, A.; McIntosh, A. M.; Heitmeier, S.; Rangarajan, S.; O'Donnell, M.; Smith, E. E.; Yusuf, S.; Whiteley, W. N.; Pare, G.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293236\nBackgroundDecline in cognitive function is the most feared aspect of ageing. Poorer midlife cognitive function is associated with increased dementia and stroke risk. The mechanisms underlying variation in cognitive function are uncertain. MethodsWe assessed associations between 1160 proteins plasma levels and two measures of cognitive function, the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 1198 PURE-MIND participants. We assessed key MRI-ascertained structural brain phenotypes as potential mediators of associations between plasma protein levels and cognitive function. Potentially causal effects of protein levels on structural brain phenotypes and neurological outcomes were assessed using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. ResultsWe identified five DSST performance-associated proteins (NCAN, BCAN, CA14, MOG, CDCP1), with NCAN and CDCP1 showing replicated association in an independent cohort, GS (N=1053). MRI-assessed structural brain phenotypes partially mediated (8-19%) associations between NCAN, BCAN, and MOG, and DSST performance. MR analyses suggested higher CA14 levels might cause larger hippocampal volume and increased stroke risk, whilst higher CDCP1 levels might increase stroke and intracranial aneurysm risk. ConclusionsWe identify cognition-associated plasma proteins with potentially causal effects on brain structure and risk for neurological diseases. Our findings highlight candidates for further study and the potential for drug repurposing to reduce risk of stroke and cognitive decline.\nSubthalamic deep brain stimulation alleviates motor symptoms without restoring deficits in corticospinal suppression during movement preparation in Parkinson disease\nAuthors: Wilhelm, E.; Derosiere, G.; Quoilin, C.; Cakiroglu, I.; Paco, S.; Raftopoulos, C.; Nuttin, B.; Duque, J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293486\nBackground: Parkinson disease (PD) patients exhibit alterations in neurophysiological mechanisms underlying movement preparation, especially the suppression of corticospinal excitability - called preparatory suppression - considered to propel movement execution by increasing motor neural gain in healthy individuals. Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) being an attractive treatment for advanced PD, we aimed to investigate the potential contribution of this nucleus to PD-related changes in such corticospinal dynamics. Methods: On two consecutive days, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over both primary motor cortices in 20 PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS (ON vs. OFF), as well as 20 healthy control subjects. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at rest or during a left- or right-hand response preparation in an instructed-delay choice reaction time task. Preparatory suppression was assessed by expressing amplitudes of motor potentials evoked during movement preparation relative to rest. Results: Advanced PD patients exhibited a deficit in corticospinal suppression during movement preparation, limited to the responding hand (especially the most-affected), independently of STN-DBS. Significant links between preparatory suppression and clinical variables were found for least-affected hands only. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of altered corticospinal dynamics during movement preparation in advanced PD patients treated with STN-DBS. Consistent with results in earlier-stage patients, preparatory suppression deficits were limited to the responding hand and most pronounced on the most-affected side. STN-DBS did not restore this abnormality, which warrants further investigations into possible neuroanatomical sources of such corticospinal suppression, necessary to understand the consistent lack of this mechanism in PD patients.\nDivergent enlarged perivascular spaces volumes in early versus late age-of-onset Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Younes, K.; Cobigo, Y.; Tsuie, T.; Wang, E.; Wolf, A.; La Joie, R.; Soleimani-Meigooni, D. N.; Asken, B.; Tosun, D.; Kramer, J. H.; Ferguson, A. R.; Miller, B. L.; Mormino, E. C.; Schwartz, D.; Silbert, L. C.; Rabinovici, G.; Rosen, H.; Elahi, F. M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293514\nINTRODUCTIONEnlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are considered a conduit for the brains waste clearance system. With aging, the brains ability to clear molecules is thought to decline, contributing to the retention of Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathology. However, the role of EPVS in late-onset AD (LOAD) is complicated by co-morbidities. Early-onset AD (EOAD) offers a unique opportunity to understand the role of EPVS in AD. METHODSAutomatically-segmented EPVS volumes in biomarker-confirmed EOAD (n=58) and LOAD (n=43) and age-matched Controls (n=60) were correlated with amyloid and tau PET and cognition. Linear regression models were used. RESULTSIn LOAD, higher EPVS volumes were associated with better memory and functional performance. However, this association was not observed in EOAD. Additionally, higher tau levels were linked to increased EPVS in LOAD, but not in EOAD. DISCUSSIONEOAD and LOAD demonstrate distinct associations between EPVS, AD hallmarks, and cognition, suggesting differences in EPVSs role in these AD subtypes, necessitating further investigation.\nCSF proteome profiling reveals highly specific biomarkers for dementia with Lewy bodies.\nAuthors: del Campo, M.; Vermunt, L.; Peeters, C.; Hok-A-Hin, Y.; Lleo, A.; Alcolea, D.; van Nee, M.; Engelborghs, S.; Sieben, A.; Chen-Plotkin, A.; Irwin, D.; van der Flier, W.; Lemstra, A.; Teunissen, C.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292447\nDiagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging and biofluid biomarkers specific for DLB are highly needed. Here we use proximity extension-based multiplex assays to establish the specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic changes that underlie DLB in an unprecedented well-characterized cohort of 109 DLB patients, 235 patients with Alzheime[r]s disease (AD) and 190 controls. We identified more than 50 CSF proteins dysregulated in DLB, which were especially related to myelination processes. An enzyme involved in dopamine biosynthesis (L-amino acid decarboxylase, DDC) was the strongest dysregulated protein in DLB (\u003e1.5 fold-change vs.CON or AD; q\u003c1E-16) and could discriminate DLB from controls and AD patients with high accuracy (AUC: 0.91 and 0.81 respectively). We modelled a CSF protein panel containing only seven of these markers, which discriminate DLB from AD with higher performance (AUC: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.86-0.98). We developed custom multiplex assays for six of these markers (DDC, CRH, MMP-3, ABL1, MMP-10 and THOP1); and validated their performance in independent cohorts (n=329; AUCs: 0.68-0.90), including an autopsy cohort (n=76; AUCs: 0.90-0.95). This extensive and unique DLB CSF proteome study depicts specific protein changes underlying DLB pathophysiology. It translates these findings into a custom CSF biomarker panel able to identify DLB patients with high accuracy in different independent cohorts, providing new testing opportunities for diagnostic settings and clinical trials.\nPhenotypic effect of GBA1 variants in individuals with and without Parkinson disease: the RAPSODI study\nAuthors: Toffoli, M.; Chohan, H.; Mullin, S.; Jesuthasan, A.; Yalkic, S.; Koletsi, S.; Menozzi, E.; Rahal, S.; Limbachiya, N.; Loefflad, N.; Higgins, A.; Bestwick, J.; Lucas-Del-Pozo, S.; Fierli, F.; Farbos, A.; Mezabrovschi, R.; Lee-Yin, C.; Schrag, A.; Moreno-Martinez, D.; Hughes, D.; Noyce, A.; Colclough, K.; Jeffries, A. R.; Proukakis, C.; Schapira, A. H.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23291637\nBackgroundVariants in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD). They are also risk factors for Parkinson disease (PD), and modify the expression of the PD phenotype. The penetrance of GBA1 variants in PD is incomplete, and the ability to determine who amongst GBA1 variant carriers are at higher risk of developing PD, would represent an advantage for prognostic and trial design purposes. ObjectivesTo compare the motor and non-motor phenotype of GBA1 carriers and non-carriers. MethodsWe present the cross-sectional results of the baseline assessment from the RAPSODI study, an online assessment tool for PD patients and GBA1 variant carriers. The assessment includes clinically validated questionnaires, a tap-test, the University of Pennsyllvania Smell Identification Test and cognitive tests. Additional, homogeneous data from the PREDICT-PD cohort were included. ResultsA total of 379 participants completed all parts of the RAPSODI assessment (89 GBA1-negative controls, 169 GBA1-negative PD, 47 GBA1-positive PD, 47 non-affected GBA1 carriers, 27 GD). Eightysix participants were were recruited through PREDICT-PD (43 non-affected GBA1 carriers and 43 GBA1-negative controls). GBA1-positive PD showed worse performance in visual cognitive tasks and olfaction compared to GBA1-negative PD patients. No differences were detected between non-affected GBA1 carriers carriers and GBA1-negative controls. No phenotypic differences were observed between any of the non-PD groups. ConclusionsOur results support previous evidence that GBA1-positive PD has a specific phenotype with more severe non-motor symptoms. However, we did not reproduce previous findings of more frequent prodromal PD signs in non-affected GBA1 carriers.\nAutomated artifact injection into sensing-capable brain modulation devices for neural-behavioral synchronization and the influence of device state\nAuthors: Alarie, M. E.; Provenza, N. R.; Herron, J. A.; Asaad, W. F.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293393\nBackgroundSensing-enabled deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices enable opportunities to investigate correlations between neural activity and behavior. Unfortunately, these devices do not allow straightforward synchronization of neural data with external events. ObjectiveTo implement and assess an automated neural-behavioral synchronization system for a fully implanted DBS system. Methods and ResultsWe describe a synchronization strategy that relies on computer-driven artifact injection via event-triggered transcutaneous stimulation (TS). We validated the temporal accuracy of the approach in two patients receiving DBS for treatment of Parkinsons disease, observing consistently low jitter between task events and subsequent TS artifacts during DBS OFF ({+/-} 22.9ms) and ON ({+/-} 9.08ms) conditions. Notably, we observed that event-triggered TS was modulated by device state, where active circuitry during specific streaming modes influenced artifact injection in the data. ConclusionWe describe a rigorous approach for neural-behavioral alignment using fully implanted DBS systems and demonstrate how accuracy of alignment depends on device state.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used in clinical research, but their extent is complex and largely unknown in the field of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). This scoping review describes state-of-the-art ML in ND research using MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Central (Cochrane), and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore. Included articles, published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, used patient data on Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, or Huntingtons disease that employed ML methods during primary analysis. One reviewer screened citations for inclusion; 5 conducted data extraction. For each article, we abstracted the type of ND; publication year; sample size; ML algorithm data type; primary clinical goal (disease diagnosis/prognosis/prediction of treatment effect); and ML method type. Quantitative and qualitative syntheses of the results were conducted. After screening 4,471 citations and searching 1,677 full-text articles, 1,485 articles were included. The number of articles using ML methods in ND research increased from 172 in 2016 to 490 in 2020, with most of those in Alzheimers disease. The most common data type was imaging data (46.9% of articles), followed by functional (20.6%), clinical (14.2%), biospecimen (6.2%), genetic (5.9%), electrophysiological (5.1%), and molecular (1.1%). Overall, 68.5% of imaging data studies were in Alzheimers disease and 75.9% of functional data studies were in Parkinsons disease. Disease diagnosis was the most common clinical aim in studies using ML methods (73.5%), followed by disease prognosis (21.4%) and prediction of treatment effect (13.5%). We extracted 2,734 ML methods, with support vector machine (n=651, 23.8%), random forest (n=310, 11.3%), and convolutional neural network (n=166, 6.1%) representing the majority. Finally, we identified 322 unique ML methods. There are opportunities for additional research using ML methods for disease prognosis and prediction of treatment effect. Addressing these utilization gaps will be important in future studies.

Author SummaryFew state-of-the-art scientific updates have been targeted for broader readerships without indulging in technical jargon. We have learned a lot from Judea Pearl on how to put things into context and make them clear. In this review paper, we identify machine learning methods used in the realm of neurodegenerative diseases and describe how the use of these methods can be enhanced in neurodegenerative disease research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of adaptive neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDecline in cognitive function is the most feared aspect of ageing. Poorer midlife cognitive function is associated with increased dementia and stroke risk. The mechanisms underlying variation in cognitive function are uncertain.

MethodsWe assessed associations between 1160 proteins plasma levels and two measures of cognitive function, the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 1198 PURE-MIND participants. We assessed key MRI-ascertained structural brain phenotypes as potential mediators of associations between plasma protein levels and cognitive function. Potentially causal effects of protein levels on structural brain phenotypes and neurological outcomes were assessed using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.

ResultsWe identified five DSST performance-associated proteins (NCAN, BCAN, CA14, MOG, CDCP1), with NCAN and CDCP1 showing replicated association in an independent cohort, GS (N=1053). MRI-assessed structural brain phenotypes partially mediated (8-19%) associations between NCAN, BCAN, and MOG, and DSST performance. MR analyses suggested higher CA14 levels might cause larger hippocampal volume and increased stroke risk, whilst higher CDCP1 levels might increase stroke and intracranial aneurysm risk.

ConclusionsWe identify cognition-associated plasma proteins with potentially causal effects on brain structure and risk for neurological diseases. Our findings highlight candidates for further study and the potential for drug repurposing to reduce risk of stroke and cognitive decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Parkinson disease (PD) patients exhibit alterations in neurophysiological mechanisms underlying movement preparation, especially the suppression of corticospinal excitability - called preparatory suppression - considered to propel movement execution by increasing motor neural gain in healthy individuals. Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) being an attractive treatment for advanced PD, we aimed to investigate the potential contribution of this nucleus to PD-related changes in such corticospinal dynamics. Methods: On two consecutive days, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over both primary motor cortices in 20 PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS (ON vs. OFF), as well as 20 healthy control subjects. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at rest or during a left- or right-hand response preparation in an instructed-delay choice reaction time task. Preparatory suppression was assessed by expressing amplitudes of motor potentials evoked during movement preparation relative to rest. Results: Advanced PD patients exhibited a deficit in corticospinal suppression during movement preparation, limited to the responding hand (especially the most-affected), independently of STN-DBS. Significant links between preparatory suppression and clinical variables were found for least-affected hands only. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of altered corticospinal dynamics during movement preparation in advanced PD patients treated with STN-DBS. Consistent with results in earlier-stage patients, preparatory suppression deficits were limited to the responding hand and most pronounced on the most-affected side. STN-DBS did not restore this abnormality, which warrants further investigations into possible neuroanatomical sources of such corticospinal suppression, necessary to understand the consistent lack of this mechanism in PD patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONEnlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are considered a conduit for the brains waste clearance system. With aging, the brains ability to clear molecules is thought to decline, contributing to the retention of Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathology. However, the role of EPVS in late-onset AD (LOAD) is complicated by co-morbidities. Early-onset AD (EOAD) offers a unique opportunity to understand the role of EPVS in AD.

METHODSAutomatically-segmented EPVS volumes in biomarker-confirmed EOAD (n=58) and LOAD (n=43) and age-matched Controls (n=60) were correlated with amyloid and tau PET and cognition. Linear regression models were used.

RESULTSIn LOAD, higher EPVS volumes were associated with better memory and functional performance. However, this association was not observed in EOAD. Additionally, higher tau levels were linked to increased EPVS in LOAD, but not in EOAD.

DISCUSSIONEOAD and LOAD demonstrate distinct associations between EPVS, AD hallmarks, and cognition, suggesting differences in EPVSs role in these AD subtypes, necessitating further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging and biofluid biomarkers specific for DLB are highly needed. Here we use proximity extension-based multiplex assays to establish the specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic changes that underlie DLB in an unprecedented well-characterized cohort of 109 DLB patients, 235 patients with Alzheime[r]s disease (AD) and 190 controls. We identified more than 50 CSF proteins dysregulated in DLB, which were especially related to myelination processes. An enzyme involved in dopamine biosynthesis (L-amino acid decarboxylase, DDC) was the strongest dysregulated protein in DLB (&gt;1.5 fold-change vs.CON or AD; q&lt;1E-16) and could discriminate DLB from controls and AD patients with high accuracy (AUC: 0.91 and 0.81 respectively). We modelled a CSF protein panel containing only seven of these markers, which discriminate DLB from AD with higher performance (AUC: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.86-0.98). We developed custom multiplex assays for six of these markers (DDC, CRH, MMP-3, ABL1, MMP-10 and THOP1); and validated their performance in independent cohorts (n=329; AUCs: 0.68-0.90), including an autopsy cohort (n=76; AUCs: 0.90-0.95). This extensive and unique DLB CSF proteome study depicts specific protein changes underlying DLB pathophysiology. It translates these findings into a custom CSF biomarker panel able to identify DLB patients with high accuracy in different independent cohorts, providing new testing opportunities for diagnostic settings and clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundVariants in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD). They are also risk factors for Parkinson disease (PD), and modify the expression of the PD phenotype.

The penetrance of GBA1 variants in PD is incomplete, and the ability to determine who amongst GBA1 variant carriers are at higher risk of developing PD, would represent an advantage for prognostic and trial design purposes.

ObjectivesTo compare the motor and non-motor phenotype of GBA1 carriers and non-carriers.

MethodsWe present the cross-sectional results of the baseline assessment from the RAPSODI study, an online assessment tool for PD patients and GBA1 variant carriers. The assessment includes clinically validated questionnaires, a tap-test, the University of Pennsyllvania Smell Identification Test and cognitive tests. Additional, homogeneous data from the PREDICT-PD cohort were included.

ResultsA total of 379 participants completed all parts of the RAPSODI assessment (89 GBA1-negative controls, 169 GBA1-negative PD, 47 GBA1-positive PD, 47 non-affected GBA1 carriers, 27 GD). Eightysix participants were were recruited through PREDICT-PD (43 non-affected GBA1 carriers and 43 GBA1-negative controls). GBA1-positive PD showed worse performance in visual cognitive tasks and olfaction compared to GBA1-negative PD patients. No differences were detected between non-affected GBA1 carriers carriers and GBA1-negative controls. No phenotypic differences were observed between any of the non-PD groups.

ConclusionsOur results support previous evidence that GBA1-positive PD has a specific phenotype with more severe non-motor symptoms. However, we did not reproduce previous findings of more frequent prodromal PD signs in non-affected GBA1 carriers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSensing-enabled deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices enable opportunities to investigate correlations between neural activity and behavior. Unfortunately, these devices do not allow straightforward synchronization of neural data with external events.

ObjectiveTo implement and assess an automated neural-behavioral synchronization system for a fully implanted DBS system.

Methods and ResultsWe describe a synchronization strategy that relies on computer-driven artifact injection via event-triggered transcutaneous stimulation (TS). We validated the temporal accuracy of the approach in two patients receiving DBS for treatment of Parkinsons disease, observing consistently low jitter between task events and subsequent TS artifacts during DBS OFF ({&#43;/-} 22.9ms) and ON ({&#43;/-} 9.08ms) conditions. Notably, we observed that event-triggered TS was modulated by device state, where active circuitry during specific streaming modes influenced artifact injection in the data.

ConclusionWe describe a rigorous approach for neural-behavioral alignment using fully implanted DBS systems and demonstrate how accuracy of alignment depends on device state.</p>
