We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. Methods: Participants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results: 277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. Conclusion: More than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.\nTowards cascading genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Altmann, A.; Aksman, L. M.; Oxtoby, N. P.; Young, A.; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initative (ADNI), ; Alexander, D. C.; Barkhof, F.; Shoai, M.; Hardy, J.; Schott, J. M.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300062\nBackground: Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Here we investigate whether genetic risk for AD contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. Methods: Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In 425 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (PRS; beyond APOE) to convert to A+T- status (68 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 402 participants with A+T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (46 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. Results: For progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.65-4.45; P\u003c0.001), while PRS did not (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.82-1.40; P=0.65). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.65 95% CI: 1.05-2.59; P=0.030), while the PRS showed an increased contribution (HR=1.67; 95% CI:1.22-2.28; P=0.0014). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.81; 95% CI: 1.14-6.91; P=0.025) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.5; 95% CI: 0.75-2.99; P=0.25). Conclusion: The genetic risk for LOAD unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to AD as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.\nA limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome associated with TDP-43 pathology\nAuthors: Corriveau-Lecavalier, N.; Botha, H.; Graff-Radford, J.; Switzer, A. R.; Przybelski, S. A.; Wiste, H. J.; Murray, M. E.; Reichard, R. R.; Dickson, D. W.; Nguyen, A.; Ramanan, V.; McCarter, S. J.; Boeve, B. F.; Machulda, M. M.; Fields, J. A.; Stricker, N. S.; Nelson, P. T.; Grothe, M. J.; Knopman, D. S.; Lowe, V. J.; Petersen, R. C.; Jack, C. R.; Jones, D. T.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.23298314\nLimbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.\nA Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis\nAuthors: Schweickart, A.; Batra, R.; Neth, B. J.; Martino, C.; Shenhav, L.; Zhang, A. R.; Shi, P.; Karu, N.; Huynh, K.; Meikle, P. J.; Schimmel, L.; Dilmore, A. H.; Blennow, K.; Zetterberg, H.; Blach, C.; Dorrestein, P. C.; Knight, R.; Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project Consortium, ; Craft, S.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; Krumsiek, J.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298990\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.\nCerebrovascular disease drives Alzheimer plasma biomarker concentrations in adults with Down syndrome\nAuthors: Edwards, N. C.; Lao, P. J.; Alshikho, M. J.; Ericsson, O. M.; Rizvi, B.; Petersen, M. E.; O'Bryant, S.; Flores-Aguilar, L.; Simoes, S.; Mapstone, M.; Tudorascu, D. L.; Janelidze, S.; Hansson, O.; Handen, B. L.; Christian, B. T.; Lee, J. H.; Lai, F.; Rosas, H. D.; Zaman, S.; Lott, I. T.; Yassa, M. A.; Gutierrez, J.; Wilcock, D. M.; Head, E.; Brickman, A. M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23298693\nImportanceBy age 40 years over 90% of adults with Down syndrome (DS) have Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology and most progress to dementia. Despite having few systemic vascular risk factors, individuals with DS have elevated cerebrovascular disease (CVD) markers that track with the clinical progression of AD, suggesting a role for CVD that is hypothesized to be mediated by inflammatory factors. ObjectiveTo examine the pathways through which small vessel CVD contributes to AD-related pathophysiology and neurodegeneration in adults with DS. DesignCross sectional analysis of neuroimaging, plasma, and clinical data. SettingParticipants were enrolled in Alzheimers Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome (ABC-DS), a multisite study of AD in adults with DS. ParticipantsOne hundred eighty-five participants (mean [SD] age=45.2 [9.3] years) with available MRI and plasma biomarker data were included. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were derived from T2-weighted FLAIR MRI scans and plasma biomarker concentrations of amyloid beta (A{beta}42/A{beta}40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau217), astrocytosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain, NfL) were measured with ultrasensitive immunoassays. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe examined the bivariate relationships of WMH, A{beta}42/A{beta}40, p-tau217, and GFAP with age-residualized NfL across AD diagnostic groups. A series of mediation and path analyses examined causal pathways linking WMH and AD pathophysiology to promote neurodegeneration in the total sample and groups stratified by clinical diagnosis. ResultsThere was a direct and indirect bidirectional effect through GFAP of WMH on p-tau217 concentration, which was associated with NfL concentration in the entire sample. Among cognitively stable participants, WMH was directly and indirectly, through GFAP, associated with p-tau217 concentration, and in those with MCI, there was a direct effect of WMH on p-tau217 and NfL concentrations. There were no associations of WMH with biomarker concentrations among those diagnosed with dementia. Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings suggest that among individuals with DS, CVD promotes neurodegeneration by increasing astrocytosis and tau pathophysiology in the presymptomatic phases of AD. This work joins an emerging literature that implicates CVD and its interface with neuroinflammation as a core pathological feature of AD in adults with DS. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo white matter hyperintensities, a magnetic resonance imaging marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, predict plasma Alzheimers biomarker concentrations of amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammatory pathophysiology and downstream neurodegeneration in adults with Down syndrome? FindingsIncreases in white matter hyperintensity volume precede and promote inflammation- and tau-related pathophysiology, directly and indirectly, leading to downstream neurodegeneration. MeaningSmall vessel cerebrovascular disease may contribute to the pathophysiological progression of Alzheimers disease in adults with Down syndrome. These findings support the hypothesis that cerebrovascular disease is a core feature of Alzheimers disease in adults with Down syndrome.\nPlasma neurofilament light chain is elevated in Niemann-Pick Type C but glial fibrillary acidic protein is not\nAuthors: Eratne, D.; Lewis, C.; Loi, S. M.; Chiu, W.-H.; Blennow, K. M.; Zetterberg, H.; Santillo, A. F.; Velakoulis, D.; Walterfang, M.; The MiND Study Group, Score: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299884\nABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges. RESULTS: Plasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p\u003c0.001), and reference ranges (all \u003e98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL). DISCUSSION: The study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: Orthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. Methods: Participants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results: 277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. Conclusion: More than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (&#43;) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (LOAD). Here we investigate whether genetic risk for AD contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. Methods: Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In 425 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (PRS; beyond APOE) to convert to A&#43;T- status (68 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 402 participants with A&#43;T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A&#43;T&#43; (46 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. Results: For progression from A-T- to A&#43;T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.65-4.45; P&lt;0.001), while PRS did not (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.82-1.40; P=0.65). Conversely, for the transition from A&#43;T- to A&#43;T&#43;, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.65 95% CI: 1.05-2.59; P=0.030), while the PRS showed an increased contribution (HR=1.67; 95% CI:1.22-2.28; P=0.0014). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.81; 95% CI: 1.14-6.91; P=0.025) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.5; 95% CI: 0.75-2.99; P=0.25). Conclusion: The genetic risk for LOAD unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to AD as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a persons dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KDs metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceBy age 40 years over 90% of adults with Down syndrome (DS) have Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology and most progress to dementia. Despite having few systemic vascular risk factors, individuals with DS have elevated cerebrovascular disease (CVD) markers that track with the clinical progression of AD, suggesting a role for CVD that is hypothesized to be mediated by inflammatory factors.

ObjectiveTo examine the pathways through which small vessel CVD contributes to AD-related pathophysiology and neurodegeneration in adults with DS.

DesignCross sectional analysis of neuroimaging, plasma, and clinical data.

SettingParticipants were enrolled in Alzheimers Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome (ABC-DS), a multisite study of AD in adults with DS.

ParticipantsOne hundred eighty-five participants (mean [SD] age=45.2 [9.3] years) with available MRI and plasma biomarker data were included. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were derived from T2-weighted FLAIR MRI scans and plasma biomarker concentrations of amyloid beta (A{beta}42/A{beta}40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau217), astrocytosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain, NfL) were measured with ultrasensitive immunoassays.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe examined the bivariate relationships of WMH, A{beta}42/A{beta}40, p-tau217, and GFAP with age-residualized NfL across AD diagnostic groups. A series of mediation and path analyses examined causal pathways linking WMH and AD pathophysiology to promote neurodegeneration in the total sample and groups stratified by clinical diagnosis.

ResultsThere was a direct and indirect bidirectional effect through GFAP of WMH on p-tau217 concentration, which was associated with NfL concentration in the entire sample. Among cognitively stable participants, WMH was directly and indirectly, through GFAP, associated with p-tau217 concentration, and in those with MCI, there was a direct effect of WMH on p-tau217 and NfL concentrations. There were no associations of WMH with biomarker concentrations among those diagnosed with dementia.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings suggest that among individuals with DS, CVD promotes neurodegeneration by increasing astrocytosis and tau pathophysiology in the presymptomatic phases of AD. This work joins an emerging literature that implicates CVD and its interface with neuroinflammation as a core pathological feature of AD in adults with DS.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo white matter hyperintensities, a magnetic resonance imaging marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, predict plasma Alzheimers biomarker concentrations of amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammatory pathophysiology and downstream neurodegeneration in adults with Down syndrome?

FindingsIncreases in white matter hyperintensity volume precede and promote inflammation- and tau-related pathophysiology, directly and indirectly, leading to downstream neurodegeneration.

MeaningSmall vessel cerebrovascular disease may contribute to the pathophysiological progression of Alzheimers disease in adults with Down syndrome. These findings support the hypothesis that cerebrovascular disease is a core feature of Alzheimers disease in adults with Down syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges. RESULTS: Plasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), and reference ranges (all &gt;98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL). DISCUSSION: The study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.</p>
