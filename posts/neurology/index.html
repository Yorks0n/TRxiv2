  "articleBody": " Noradrenergic modulation of saccades in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Orlando, I. F.; Hezemans, F. H.; Ye, R.; Murley, A. G.; Holland, N.; Regenthal, R.; Barker, R. A.; Williams Gray, C. H.; Passamonti, L.; Robbins, T.; Rowe, J.; O'Callaghan, C.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300879\nNoradrenaline is a powerful modulator of cognitive processes, including action-decisions underlying saccadic control. Changes in saccadic eye movements are common across neurodegenerative diseases of ageing, including Parkinson's disease. With growing interest in noradrenergic treatment potential for non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, the temporal precision of oculomotor function is advantageous to assess the effects of this modulation. Here we studied the effect of 40 mg atomoxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, in nineteen people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease using a single dose, randomised double-blind crossover placebo-controlled design. Twenty-five healthy adult participants completed the assessments to provide normative data. Participants performed prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. The latency, velocity and accuracy of saccades, and resting pupil diameter, were measured. Increased pupil diameter on the drug confirmed its expected effect on the locus coeruleus ascending arousal system. Atomoxetine improved key aspects of saccade performance: prosaccade latencies were faster and the saccadic main sequence was normalised. These improvements were accompanied by increased antisaccade error rates on the drug. Together these findings suggest a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off for visuo-motor decisions in response to noradrenergic treatment. Our results provide new evidence to substantiate a role for noradrenergic modulation of saccades, and based on known circuitry we advance the hypothesis that this reflects modulation at the level of the locus coeruleus-superior colliculus pathway. Given the potential for noradrenergic treatment of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and related conditions, the oculomotor system can support the assessment of cognitive effects without limb-motor confounds on task performance.\nNeuroimaging markers of patient-reported outcome measures in acute ischemic stroke\nAuthors: Oliveira, L. C.; Bonkhoff, A. K.; Regenhardt, R. W.; Alhadid, K.; Tuozzo, C.; Etherton, M. R.; Rost, N. S.; Schirmer, M. D.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299829\nObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables. ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores. ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.\nBiomarker changes preceding symptom onset in genetic prion disease\nAuthors: Vallabh, S. M.; Mortberg, M. A.; Allen, S. W.; Kupferschmid, A. C.; Kivisakk, P.; Hammerschlag, B. L.; Bolling, A.; Trombetta, B. A.; Devitte-McKee, K.; Ford, A. M.; Sather, L.; Duffy, G.; Rivera, A.; Gerber, J.; McManus, A. J.; Minikel, E. V.; Arnold, S. E.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300042\nImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset. ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls. Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study. Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma. ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints. Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset? FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.\nCardiac Troponin T is a Serum Biomarker of Respiratory Dysfunction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nAuthors: Koch, T.; Fabian, R.; Weinhold, L.; Koch, F. W.; Barakat, S.; Castro-Gomez, S.; Grehl, T.; Bernsen, S.; Weydt, P.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.23300684\nObjectiveInformative biomarkers are an urgent need in management and therapy development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Serum cardiac troponin T is elevated in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and not correlated with neurofilaments. We sought to delineate the functional implications and the informative value of serum troponin T with regard to respiratory function, a major prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. MethodsWe analyzed two independent hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts (d=discovery cohort; v= validation cohort) with data available on serum cardiac troponin T levels (nd=297; nv=49), serum neurofilament light chain levels (nd=116; nv=17), and routine respiratory test results (nd=86; nv=49). ResultsSerum cardiac troponin T levels, unlike serum neurofilaments, were strongly associated with the respiratory domain of the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating score (rd = - 0.29, pd = 0.001; rv= - 0.48, pv = 0.007) and with relevant pulmonary function parameters (nd), namely SVC% (r = - 0.45; p = 0.001), FVC% (r = - 0.43; p = 0.001), FEV1% (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and PEF (r = - 0.34, p = 0.027). Serum cardiac Troponin T reliably discriminated benchmarks of SVC% \u003c 80%: (AUC 0.75, p = 0.003), FVC % \u003c 80%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.011) and PEF% \u003c75%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.015). InterpretationOur findings confirm cardiac Troponin T as an informative serum biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, complementing neurofilaments. Serum Troponin T can flag compromised respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and might prove useful as a proxy of respiratory impairment with prognostic implications.\nHarmonic patterns embedding ictal EEG signals in focal epilepsy: a new insight into the epileptogenic zone\nAuthors: Hu, L.; Ye, L.; Ye, H.; Liu, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zheng, Z.; Jiang, H.; Chen, C.; Wang, Z.; Zhu, J.; Chen, Z.; Yang, D.; Wang, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300274\nThe ictal EEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) need to be better defined. The power and structure of ictal fast activity are important in EZ localization, but EEG onset patterns are heterogeneous and initial fast activity is absent in many patients. Here we defined a unique spectral structure of \"harmonic pattern\" (H pattern) on stereo-EEG (SEEG), characterized by multiple equidistant, high-density bands with varying frequency on time frequency map. H pattern was commonly observed among 57 (81.4%) out of 70 patients with focal onset pattern on SEEG. It was presented in seizures with various ictal onset patterns with or without fast activity, and during early or late stage of seizures. H pattern usually expressed at very close time point across the seizure onset zone (SOZ), primary propagation zone and sometimes other areas, with the same fundamental difference, reflecting an inter-regional synchronization within the ictal network during this time. Notably, SOZ showed the highest proportion of channels expressing H-pattern, and also highest band number of H-pattern. At patient level, the dominant H pattern was defined as those with high rank in band numbers (the third quartile, Q3). Resection of the region expressing dominant H pattern, but not SOZ, independently predicted seizure freedom after surgery, suggesting it is an ictal marker of EZ. How H pattern was produced was then investigated. It only embedded into two types of EEG segments: fast activity with a frequency \u003e25Hz (FA-H pattern) at early seizure propagation (mean 13.3 sec after onset), and irregular polyspikes (\u003e 5 Hz, PS-H pattern) during late propagation (mean 23.3 sec after onset). Nonlinear analysis was used to unravel the mechanism underlying H pattern generation. Our data showed it was produced by specific nonlinear phenomena rather than intermodulation of frequencies or purely methodological artefact. The nonlinearity was stronger for dominant compared to non-dominant H pattern. According to the spectral parameters, we postulate that FA-H pattern may be supported by a predominant and synchronized firing of GABAergic neurons, while excitatory neuron firing is more important for PS-H pattern. As a distinctive and common ictal spectral feature, H pattern conveys unique information of ictal neural dynamics and provides new insights into the EZ. Our study also provides evidence that there is an elongated time-window to measure EZ using quantitative EEG.\nOnset of Alzheimer disease in apolipoprotein ε4 carriers is earlier in butyrylcholinesterase K variant carriers\nAuthors: Lane, R. M.; Darreh-Shori, T.; Junge, C.; Li, D.; Yang, Q. M.; Edwards, A.; Graham, D.; Moore, K.; Mummery, C. J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300718\nBackgroundWe wished to examine the impact of the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) carrier status on age-at-diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers. MethodsIn 45 patients, aged 50-74 years, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker confirmed mild AD, recruited into a clinical trial (NCT03186989), baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and biomarkers were evaluated by BCHE-K and APOE4 allelic status. ResultsIn APOE4 carriers (N = 33), mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in BCHE-K carriers (n = 11) was 6.4 years earlier than in BCHE-K noncarriers (n = 22, P \u003c .001, ANOVA). In APOE4 noncarriers (N = 12) there was no similar influence of BCHE-K. In APOE4 carriers with versus those without BCHE-K, mean age-at-baseline was over 6 years earlier and accompanied by slightly higher amyloid and tau accumulations. A predominant amyloid, limited tau pathophysiology, and limbic-amnestic phenotype was exemplified by APOE4 homozygotes with BCHE-K. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated association of amyloid accumulation with APOE4 carrier status (P \u003c .029), larger total brain ventricle volume (P \u003c .021), less synaptic injury (Ng, P \u003c .001), and less tau (p-tau181, P \u003c .005). In contrast, tau pathophysiology was associated with more neuroaxonal damage (NfL, P = .002), more synaptic injury (Ng, P \u003c .001), and higher levels of glial activation (YKL-40, P = .01). ConclusionFindings concern the genetic architecture of prognosis in early AD, that is fundamental for patients and the design of clinical trials, and that is less well established than the genetics of susceptibility. In mild AD patients aged less than 75 years, the mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in APOE4 carriers was reduced by over 6 years in BCHE-K carriers versus noncarriers. Functional activation of glia may explain much of the effects of APOE4 and BCHE-K on the phenotype of early AD.\nLongitudinal immunophenotyping to track motor progression in Parkinsons Associated with a TH mutation\nAuthors: Gopinath, A.; Ramirez-Zamora, A.; Franks, S.; Riaz, T.; Smith, A. R.; Dizon, G.; Hornstein, L.; Follett, J.; Swartz, C.; Bravo, J.; Kugelmann, L.; Farrer, M. J.; Okun, M.; Khoshbouei, H.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23300647\nBackground and Objectives: PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the fastest growing. Genetic factors account for [~]15% of cases. Despite some consistency in symptoms across idiopathic and genetic PD cases, tracking progression and treatment response remains an important challenge especially in the development of new therapies. There have been many traditional approaches to tracking including DaTscan imaging, cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, MRI, CSF analysis, and following clinical symptom progression. Methods: Our previous work showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressing dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PD patients may correlate with disease progression and with the response to treatment with levodopa. We describe a single case longitudinal follow up of a 40-45-year-old woman with PD who carried a heterozygous TH mutation. We assessed her clinical features over 18 months with DaT scans and immunophenotyping of her PBMCs. Her data were compared with idiopathic PD (n=130 subjects, both sexes) and healthy controls (n=80, age/sex matched). Results: The results revealed a rise in DAT+ immune cells which occurred coincident to documented worsening of her UPDRS-III motor scores. Unlike idiopathic PD patients, following levodopa therapy, the TH+ immune cell levels remained elevated, despite UPDRS-III score improvement. Discussion: The longitudinal immunophenotyping in this PD patient with a TH mutation suggested that DAT+ and TH+ PBMCs could be candidate biomarkers for PD progression and possibly treatment effectiveness. This study provides proof of concept to explore this approach to investigate immunophenotyping in PD progression.\nApolipoprotein E-Genotyping and MRI Study for Alzheimer's Disease Classification: PCR-RFLP and Restricted Enzymes AfIII; for RS429358 and HaeII; for RS7412\nAuthors: MOHAD AZMI, N. H.; Suppiah, S.; IBRAHIM, N. S. N.; BUHARI, I.; SERIRAMULU, V. P.; MOHAMAD, M.; KARUPPIAH, T.; OMAR, N. F.; IBRAHIM, N.; RAZALI, R. M.; HARRUN, N. H.; SALLEHUDDIN, H. M.; Syed Nasser, N.; D. Piersson, A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300735\nThe most common type of dementia in neurodegenerative diseases is Alzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neurological illness that causes memory loss. Neurophysiological tests, including the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, are used to identify AD. Neuroimaging studies T1-weighted MRI scans assessed brain structural abnormalities. AD patients had grey matter volume (GMV) loss in brain structures when structural MRI data were analysed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Neuroimaging studies using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)-blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) sequence for brain imaging were processed using the seed-based analysis (SBA) method to analyse functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network (SEN), executive control network (ECN), language network (LN), visuospatial network (VN), and salience network (SAN). Late-onset AD can be studied using the apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE). ApoE has four alleles with LOAD patients having either a homozygous or heterozygous genotype of these alleles. The genotypes, particularly ApoE {varepsilon}4, are associated with a more significant risk for AD pathogenesis. The combination of genotyping and MRI neuroimaging is a promising avenue for research that starts with protocol optimisation. Objective: to differentiate changes in structural brain volumetric and rs-fMRI functional connectivity strength with the diagnosis of AD and HC by combining ApoE {varepsilon}4 genetic variations. Materials and MethodsThirty participants with AD, n = 15, and healthy control (HC), n = 15, for the MRI study, and six participants (n = 6) with AD, n = 3, and HC, n = 3, for ApoE genotyping. In this study, we categorised the participants using neuropsychological tests, i.e., MoCA, MMSE, and CDR. We performed structural and functional MRI brain imaging to identify network areas affected by AD. Structural voxel-based morphometry (VBM) models and the CONN Toolbox, which analysed functional MRI using seed-based analysis (SBA), were performed. Genotyping was done by extracting the DNA from the participants blood samples. The isolated DNA underwent PCR-RFLP. Then, the restricted enzymes RE AFIII for rs429358 and HAEII for rs7412 were performed. ResultsThere was decreased grey matter volume (GMV) and reduced functional connectivity among AD participants involving the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate gyrus in DMN, SEN, ECN, LN, VN, and SAN. We detected three participants with a homozygous ApoE {varepsilon}4 negative genotype (non-carriers), which was consistent with the HC genotype. We also detected heterozygous genotype ApoE {varepsilon}4 positive carriers, which indicated LOAD. ConclusionThere is altered GMV in VBM, a decrease in brain activation, and an increase in spatial activation size in rs-fMRI neuronal FC in some areas of the brain with ApoE {varepsilon}4 carriers in AD participants. Thus, the imaging features of the AD participants are well mapped to their ApoE {varepsilon}4 carrier status. Thus, we propose our radiogenomics techniques as a useful biomarker for the characterisation of AD patients.\nTwelve-Month Follow-Up of Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Receiving BCMA-Directed mRNA Cell Therapy\nAuthors: Chahin, N.; Sahagian, G.; Feinberg, M. H.; Stewart, C. A.; Jewell, C. M.; Kurtoglu, M.; Miljkovic, M. D.; Vu, T.; Mozaffar, T.; Howard, J. F.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300770\nWe report the 12-month follow-up results of a phase 2 clinical of Descartes-08 (NCT04146051), BCMA-directed RNA chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (rCAR-T) therapy for myasthenia gravis (MG) given as an outpatient treatment without lymphodepletion. In the Phase 2a part of the study, all 7 participants who received six weekly infusions of Descartes-08 exhibited clinically meaningful improvement in common MG severity scales (MG Composite, MG Activities of Daily Living, Quantitative MG scores, and Quality of Life 15-revised) at Month 3. At Month 9 follow-up, all participants continued to experience marked clinical improvements. Five out of seven participants maintained clinical improvement at Month 12. Of the two participants who experienced loss of clinical effect at Month 12 and were eligible for retreatment, one was retreated and had rapid improvement in clinical scores with minimal symptom expression which was ongoing at Month 6 of follow-up. All three participants with detectable anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels at baseline experienced autoantibody reductions by Month 6, which deepened further by Month 9, and were maintained at Month 12. These data support continued development of Descartes-08 in myasthenia gravis and other autoantibody-associated autoimmune disorders.\nReal-world smartphone data can trace the behavioural impact of epilepsy: A Case study\nAuthors: van Nieuw Amerongen, A. R.; Meppelink, A. M.; Ghosh, A.; Thijs, R. D.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.23300494\nNeurobehavioural comorbidities have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of people with epilepsy, yet tracking their impact is challenging as behaviour may vary with seizures and anti-seizure medication side effects. Smartphones have the potential to monitor day-to-day neurobehavioural patterns objectively. We present the case of a man in his late twenties with refractory focal epilepsy in whom we ascertained the effects of ASMs withdrawal and a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic convulsion on his touchscreen interactions. Using a dedicated app, we recorded over 185 days, the timestamps of 718,357 interactions. We divided the various smartphone behaviours according to the next-interval dynamics of the interactions by using a joint interval distribution (JID). We analysed JIDs during two ASM load transitions: before versus during tapering and restarting medication versus tapering. Cluster-based permutation testing revealed significant differences, with accelerated next-interval dynamics during tapering and a reversal upon medication restart. We also compared the JID of the fbTCS day to the average of the three days before, showing markedly slower next-interval dynamics on the day of the convulsion. This suggests that smartphone interactions temporal dynamics may help monitor neurobehavioural comorbidities in epilepsy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Noradrenaline is a powerful modulator of cognitive processes, including action-decisions underlying saccadic control. Changes in saccadic eye movements are common across neurodegenerative diseases of ageing, including Parkinson&#39;s disease. With growing interest in noradrenergic treatment potential for non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&#39;s disease, the temporal precision of oculomotor function is advantageous to assess the effects of this modulation. Here we studied the effect of 40 mg atomoxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, in nineteen people with idiopathic Parkinson&#39;s disease using a single dose, randomised double-blind crossover placebo-controlled design. Twenty-five healthy adult participants completed the assessments to provide normative data. Participants performed prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. The latency, velocity and accuracy of saccades, and resting pupil diameter, were measured. Increased pupil diameter on the drug confirmed its expected effect on the locus coeruleus ascending arousal system. Atomoxetine improved key aspects of saccade performance: prosaccade latencies were faster and the saccadic main sequence was normalised. These improvements were accompanied by increased antisaccade error rates on the drug. Together these findings suggest a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off for visuo-motor decisions in response to noradrenergic treatment. Our results provide new evidence to substantiate a role for noradrenergic modulation of saccades, and based on known circuitry we advance the hypothesis that this reflects modulation at the level of the locus coeruleus-superior colliculus pathway. Given the potential for noradrenergic treatment of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease and related conditions, the oculomotor system can support the assessment of cognitive effects without limb-motor confounds on task performance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables.

ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores.

ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset.

ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls.

Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study.

Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma.

ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints.

Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveInformative biomarkers are an urgent need in management and therapy development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Serum cardiac troponin T is elevated in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and not correlated with neurofilaments. We sought to delineate the functional implications and the informative value of serum troponin T with regard to respiratory function, a major prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

MethodsWe analyzed two independent hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts (d=discovery cohort; v= validation cohort) with data available on serum cardiac troponin T levels (nd=297; nv=49), serum neurofilament light chain levels (nd=116; nv=17), and routine respiratory test results (nd=86; nv=49).

ResultsSerum cardiac troponin T levels, unlike serum neurofilaments, were strongly associated with the respiratory domain of the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating score (rd = - 0.29, pd = 0.001; rv= - 0.48, pv = 0.007) and with relevant pulmonary function parameters (nd), namely SVC% (r = - 0.45; p = 0.001), FVC% (r = - 0.43; p = 0.001), FEV1% (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and PEF (r = - 0.34, p = 0.027).

Serum cardiac Troponin T reliably discriminated benchmarks of SVC% &lt; 80%: (AUC 0.75, p = 0.003), FVC % &lt; 80%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.011) and PEF% &lt;75%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.015).

InterpretationOur findings confirm cardiac Troponin T as an informative serum biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, complementing neurofilaments. Serum Troponin T can flag compromised respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and might prove useful as a proxy of respiratory impairment with prognostic implications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ictal EEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) need to be better defined. The power and structure of ictal fast activity are important in EZ localization, but EEG onset patterns are heterogeneous and initial fast activity is absent in many patients. Here we defined a unique spectral structure of &#34;harmonic pattern&#34; (H pattern) on stereo-EEG (SEEG), characterized by multiple equidistant, high-density bands with varying frequency on time frequency map. H pattern was commonly observed among 57 (81.4%) out of 70 patients with focal onset pattern on SEEG. It was presented in seizures with various ictal onset patterns with or without fast activity, and during early or late stage of seizures. H pattern usually expressed at very close time point across the seizure onset zone (SOZ), primary propagation zone and sometimes other areas, with the same fundamental difference, reflecting an inter-regional synchronization within the ictal network during this time. Notably, SOZ showed the highest proportion of channels expressing H-pattern, and also highest band number of H-pattern. At patient level, the dominant H pattern was defined as those with high rank in band numbers (the third quartile, Q3). Resection of the region expressing dominant H pattern, but not SOZ, independently predicted seizure freedom after surgery, suggesting it is an ictal marker of EZ. How H pattern was produced was then investigated. It only embedded into two types of EEG segments: fast activity with a frequency &gt;25Hz (FA-H pattern) at early seizure propagation (mean 13.3 sec after onset), and irregular polyspikes (&gt; 5 Hz, PS-H pattern) during late propagation (mean 23.3 sec after onset). Nonlinear analysis was used to unravel the mechanism underlying H pattern generation. Our data showed it was produced by specific nonlinear phenomena rather than intermodulation of frequencies or purely methodological artefact. The nonlinearity was stronger for dominant compared to non-dominant H pattern. According to the spectral parameters, we postulate that FA-H pattern may be supported by a predominant and synchronized firing of GABAergic neurons, while excitatory neuron firing is more important for PS-H pattern. As a distinctive and common ictal spectral feature, H pattern conveys unique information of ictal neural dynamics and provides new insights into the EZ. Our study also provides evidence that there is an elongated time-window to measure EZ using quantitative EEG.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe wished to examine the impact of the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) carrier status on age-at-diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers.

MethodsIn 45 patients, aged 50-74 years, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker confirmed mild AD, recruited into a clinical trial (NCT03186989), baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and biomarkers were evaluated by BCHE-K and APOE4 allelic status.

ResultsIn APOE4 carriers (N = 33), mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in BCHE-K carriers (n = 11) was 6.4 years earlier than in BCHE-K noncarriers (n = 22, P &lt; .001, ANOVA). In APOE4 noncarriers (N = 12) there was no similar influence of BCHE-K. In APOE4 carriers with versus those without BCHE-K, mean age-at-baseline was over 6 years earlier and accompanied by slightly higher amyloid and tau accumulations. A predominant amyloid, limited tau pathophysiology, and limbic-amnestic phenotype was exemplified by APOE4 homozygotes with BCHE-K. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated association of amyloid accumulation with APOE4 carrier status (P &lt; .029), larger total brain ventricle volume (P &lt; .021), less synaptic injury (Ng, P &lt; .001), and less tau (p-tau181, P &lt; .005). In contrast, tau pathophysiology was associated with more neuroaxonal damage (NfL, P = .002), more synaptic injury (Ng, P &lt; .001), and higher levels of glial activation (YKL-40, P = .01).

ConclusionFindings concern the genetic architecture of prognosis in early AD, that is fundamental for patients and the design of clinical trials, and that is less well established than the genetics of susceptibility. In mild AD patients aged less than 75 years, the mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in APOE4 carriers was reduced by over 6 years in BCHE-K carriers versus noncarriers. Functional activation of glia may explain much of the effects of APOE4 and BCHE-K on the phenotype of early AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Objectives: PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the fastest growing. Genetic factors account for [~]15% of cases. Despite some consistency in symptoms across idiopathic and genetic PD cases, tracking progression and treatment response remains an important challenge especially in the development of new therapies. There have been many traditional approaches to tracking including DaTscan imaging, cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, MRI, CSF analysis, and following clinical symptom progression. Methods: Our previous work showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressing dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PD patients may correlate with disease progression and with the response to treatment with levodopa. We describe a single case longitudinal follow up of a 40-45-year-old woman with PD who carried a heterozygous TH mutation. We assessed her clinical features over 18 months with DaT scans and immunophenotyping of her PBMCs. Her data were compared with idiopathic PD (n=130 subjects, both sexes) and healthy controls (n=80, age/sex matched). Results: The results revealed a rise in DAT&#43; immune cells which occurred coincident to documented worsening of her UPDRS-III motor scores. Unlike idiopathic PD patients, following levodopa therapy, the TH&#43; immune cell levels remained elevated, despite UPDRS-III score improvement. Discussion: The longitudinal immunophenotyping in this PD patient with a TH mutation suggested that DAT&#43; and TH&#43; PBMCs could be candidate biomarkers for PD progression and possibly treatment effectiveness. This study provides proof of concept to explore this approach to investigate immunophenotyping in PD progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The most common type of dementia in neurodegenerative diseases is Alzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neurological illness that causes memory loss. Neurophysiological tests, including the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, are used to identify AD. Neuroimaging studies T1-weighted MRI scans assessed brain structural abnormalities. AD patients had grey matter volume (GMV) loss in brain structures when structural MRI data were analysed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Neuroimaging studies using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)-blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) sequence for brain imaging were processed using the seed-based analysis (SBA) method to analyse functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network (SEN), executive control network (ECN), language network (LN), visuospatial network (VN), and salience network (SAN). Late-onset AD can be studied using the apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE). ApoE has four alleles with LOAD patients having either a homozygous or heterozygous genotype of these alleles. The genotypes, particularly ApoE {varepsilon}4, are associated with a more significant risk for AD pathogenesis. The combination of genotyping and MRI neuroimaging is a promising avenue for research that starts with protocol optimisation. Objective: to differentiate changes in structural brain volumetric and rs-fMRI functional connectivity strength with the diagnosis of AD and HC by combining ApoE {varepsilon}4 genetic variations.

Materials and MethodsThirty participants with AD, n = 15, and healthy control (HC), n = 15, for the MRI study, and six participants (n = 6) with AD, n = 3, and HC, n = 3, for ApoE genotyping. In this study, we categorised the participants using neuropsychological tests, i.e., MoCA, MMSE, and CDR. We performed structural and functional MRI brain imaging to identify network areas affected by AD. Structural voxel-based morphometry (VBM) models and the CONN Toolbox, which analysed functional MRI using seed-based analysis (SBA), were performed. Genotyping was done by extracting the DNA from the participants blood samples. The isolated DNA underwent PCR-RFLP. Then, the restricted enzymes RE AFIII for rs429358 and HAEII for rs7412 were performed.

ResultsThere was decreased grey matter volume (GMV) and reduced functional connectivity among AD participants involving the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate gyrus in DMN, SEN, ECN, LN, VN, and SAN. We detected three participants with a homozygous ApoE {varepsilon}4 negative genotype (non-carriers), which was consistent with the HC genotype. We also detected heterozygous genotype ApoE {varepsilon}4 positive carriers, which indicated LOAD.

ConclusionThere is altered GMV in VBM, a decrease in brain activation, and an increase in spatial activation size in rs-fMRI neuronal FC in some areas of the brain with ApoE {varepsilon}4 carriers in AD participants. Thus, the imaging features of the AD participants are well mapped to their ApoE {varepsilon}4 carrier status. Thus, we propose our radiogenomics techniques as a useful biomarker for the characterisation of AD patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We report the 12-month follow-up results of a phase 2 clinical of Descartes-08 (NCT04146051), BCMA-directed RNA chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (rCAR-T) therapy for myasthenia gravis (MG) given as an outpatient treatment without lymphodepletion. In the Phase 2a part of the study, all 7 participants who received six weekly infusions of Descartes-08 exhibited clinically meaningful improvement in common MG severity scales (MG Composite, MG Activities of Daily Living, Quantitative MG scores, and Quality of Life 15-revised) at Month 3. At Month 9 follow-up, all participants continued to experience marked clinical improvements. Five out of seven participants maintained clinical improvement at Month 12. Of the two participants who experienced loss of clinical effect at Month 12 and were eligible for retreatment, one was retreated and had rapid improvement in clinical scores with minimal symptom expression which was ongoing at Month 6 of follow-up. All three participants with detectable anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels at baseline experienced autoantibody reductions by Month 6, which deepened further by Month 9, and were maintained at Month 12. These data support continued development of Descartes-08 in myasthenia gravis and other autoantibody-associated autoimmune disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurobehavioural comorbidities have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of people with epilepsy, yet tracking their impact is challenging as behaviour may vary with seizures and anti-seizure medication side effects. Smartphones have the potential to monitor day-to-day neurobehavioural patterns objectively. We present the case of a man in his late twenties with refractory focal epilepsy in whom we ascertained the effects of ASMs withdrawal and a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic convulsion on his touchscreen interactions. Using a dedicated app, we recorded over 185 days, the timestamps of 718,357 interactions. We divided the various smartphone behaviours according to the next-interval dynamics of the interactions by using a joint interval distribution (JID). We analysed JIDs during two ASM load transitions: before versus during tapering and restarting medication versus tapering. Cluster-based permutation testing revealed significant differences, with accelerated next-interval dynamics during tapering and a reversal upon medication restart. We also compared the JID of the fbTCS day to the average of the three days before, showing markedly slower next-interval dynamics on the day of the convulsion. This suggests that smartphone interactions temporal dynamics may help monitor neurobehavioural comorbidities in epilepsy.</p>
