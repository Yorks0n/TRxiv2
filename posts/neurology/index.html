Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.\nProbing a neural unreliability account of auditory sensory processing atypicalities in Rett Syndrome.\nAuthors: Brima, T.; Beker, S.; Prinsloo, K. D.; Butler, J. S.; Djukic, A.; Freedman, E. G.; Molholm, S.; Foxe, J. J.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301723\nBackgroundIn the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. MethodsAEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. ResultsSubstantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. ConclusionsTo accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.\nIndividual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Arnold, M.; Buyukozkan, M.; Doraiswamy, P. M.; Nho, K.; Wu, T.; Gudnason, V.; Launer, L. J.; Wang-Sattler, R.; Adamski, J.; The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ; Alzheimer's Disease Metabolomics Consortium, ; De Jager, P. L.; Ertekin-Taner, N.; Bennett, D. A.; Saykin, A. J.; Peters, A.; Suhre, K.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; Kastenmüller, G.; Krumsiek, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.23297820\nImpaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimers disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic bioenergetic capacity as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.\nCirculating Blood circular RNA in Parkinson Disease; a systematic study\nAuthors: Beric, A.; Sun, Y.; Sanchez, S.; Martin, C.; Powell, T.; Pardo, J. A.; Sanford, J.; Botia, J. A.; Cruchaga, C.; Ibanez, L.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301623\nWe aimed to identify circRNAs associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) by leveraging 1,848 participants and 1,789 circRNA from two of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood transcriptomic data. To comprehensively understand changes in circRNAs we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant, and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were consistent in the mixed models, mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. Finally, we included the 149 circRNA in a model with a ROC AUC of 0.825, showing that have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Overall, we demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be leveraged as biomarkers.\nProteomic Changes in the Human Cerebrovasculature in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathies Linked to Peripheral Biomarkers in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid\nAuthors: Wojtas, A.

E.; Seyfried, N. T.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301099\nDysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.\nGenetic Associations of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Parkinson's Disease: A Mendelian Randomisation Study\nAuthors: Shen, L.; Yang, Y.; Chin, H. L.; Huang, H.; Cheung, B. M. Y.; Tse, G.; Chou, O. H. I.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301288\nBackgroundThere is a need to establish the role of lipid-lowering agents as a therapeutic option for Parkinsons Disease (PD), but its associations remain elusive. This study investigated genetic variants proxying lipid-lowering agents through HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 inhibitors to determine casual associations with PD risk. MethodsWe utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, where low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was the outcome of interest. Genetic associations with LDL were extracted from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Summary statistics for PD were extracted from two GWAS datasets, consistent of 1,843 PD cases and 216,630 control in the first dataset and 1,570 PD cases and 1,259 controls in the second dataset. Instrumental variables (IV) were optimized with positive control analyses on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. IV-exposure associations from LDL GWAS data were integrated with IV-outcome associations from the PD GWAS data. The inverse variance weighted method was applied. Bayesian colocalization analysis identified target gene regions for LDL and PD. ResultsGenetic variations in HMGCR were significantly associated with a reduced risk of PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). However, variation in HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype compared to the postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype (OR = 8.43, 95% CI 2.12-33.52). There were trends with increased risk for the TD subtype in NPC1L1 and a decreased risk in PCSK9 but these findings did not meet the Bonferroni threshold. We identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR within the same genomic region of close proximity, with rs12916 as the leading SNP associated with LDL and rs10942735 as the leading SNP associated with PD. ConclusionA casual association between HMGCR inhibition and reduced overall PD risk was identified, but there were increased the risks of tremor-dominant subtypes.\nA pathogenic variant in RAB32 causes autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease and activates LRRK2 kinase\nAuthors: Gustavsson, E. K.; Follett, J.; Trinh, J.; Barodia, S. K.; Real, R.; Liu, Z.; Grant-Peters, M.; Fox, J. D.; Appel-Cresswell, S.; Stoessl, J. A.; Rajput, A.; Rajput, A. H.; Auer, R.; Tilney, R.; Sturm, M.; Haack, T.

J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24300927\nBackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD. MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed. FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C\u003eG (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase. InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.

        <p class="abstract">Cerebrovascular diseases are the second most common cause of death worldwide and one of the major causes of disability burden. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is &#34;stationarity&#34; of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary.

MethodsAEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures.

ResultsSubstantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a &#34;neural unreliability&#34; account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident.

ConclusionsTo accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimers disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic  bioenergetic capacity as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We aimed to identify circRNAs associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) by leveraging 1,848 participants and 1,789 circRNA from two of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood transcriptomic data. To comprehensively understand changes in circRNAs we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant, and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were consistent in the mixed models, mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. Finally, we included the 149 circRNA in a model with a ROC AUC of 0.825, showing that have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Overall, we demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be leveraged as biomarkers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is a need to establish the role of lipid-lowering agents as a therapeutic option for Parkinsons Disease (PD), but its associations remain elusive. This study investigated genetic variants proxying lipid-lowering agents through HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 inhibitors to determine casual associations with PD risk.

MethodsWe utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, where low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was the outcome of interest. Genetic associations with LDL were extracted from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Summary statistics for PD were extracted from two GWAS datasets, consistent of 1,843 PD cases and 216,630 control in the first dataset and 1,570 PD cases and 1,259 controls in the second dataset. Instrumental variables (IV) were optimized with positive control analyses on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. IV-exposure associations from LDL GWAS data were integrated with IV-outcome associations from the PD GWAS data. The inverse variance weighted method was applied. Bayesian colocalization analysis identified target gene regions for LDL and PD.

ResultsGenetic variations in HMGCR were significantly associated with a reduced risk of PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). However, variation in HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype compared to the postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype (OR = 8.43, 95% CI 2.12-33.52). There were trends with increased risk for the TD subtype in NPC1L1 and a decreased risk in PCSK9 but these findings did not meet the Bonferroni threshold. We identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR within the same genomic region of close proximity, with rs12916 as the leading SNP associated with LDL and rs10942735 as the leading SNP associated with PD.

ConclusionA casual association between HMGCR inhibition and reduced overall PD risk was identified, but there were increased the risks of tremor-dominant subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD.

MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed.

FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C&gt;G (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase.

InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.
