  "articleBody": " The coupling between brain connectivity and heartbeat dynamics unveils the altered interoceptive mechanisms in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Candia-Rivera, D.; Vidailhet, M.; Chavez, M.; de Vico Fallani, F.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292942\nParkinsons disease (PD) is often known for its classical motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms are often reported including interoceptive and autonomic dysfunctions. Autonomic dysfunctions, such as cardiovascular, urinary, or thermoregulatory abnormalities, are more prone to be associated with motor and cognitive decline, as well as increase the risk of mortality. More recent evidence has shown that Parkinsonian patients may experience alterations in interoceptive processing, i.e., reduced sensitivity to accurately sensing and interpreting internal cues, leading to further impairment in self-awareness, cognitive and emotional processing. Noteworthy, the mechanisms behind these autonomic/interoceptive dysfunctions are not well understood. During the early stages of PD, disruptions in the connectivity of multiple brain regions occur, which has prompted the study of PD as a network-level phenomenon. Our hypothesis is that by examining the relationship between brain connectivity and heartbeat dynamics, we can gain insight into the large-scale network disruptions and the neurophysiology of the disrupted interoceptive mechanisms in PD. Our results show that the coupling of fluctuating alpha and gamma connectivity with heartbeat dynamics is reduced in PD patients, as compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, we show that PD patients under dopamine medication recover part of the brain-heart coupling, in proportion with the reduced motor symptoms. Our proposal offers a promising approach to unveil the physiopathology of PD and promoting the development of new diagnostic methods for the early stages of the disease.\nSerum proteomic profiles of UK Biobank participants with Multiple Sclerosis\nAuthors: Jacobs, B. M.; Vickaryous, N.; Giovannoni, G.; Waters, S.; Dobson, R.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293146\nDiscovery of serum protein biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis risk and severity could shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms, suggest new drug targets, enhance the speed of diagnosis, and improve risk stratification algorithms for use in clinical practice or in the identification of high-risk participants for prevention trials. Prior proteome-wide studies of Multiple Sclerosis have yielded inconsistent results due to small sample sizes. We aimed to describe serum protein biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis risk and to explore protein biomarkers of disease severity using radiological outcome measures. Multiple Sclerosis cases and controls were identified in UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort study of [~]500,000 British adults. Serum proteins were assayed in [~]50,000 UK Biobank participants using the Olink proximity extension assay. We performed case-control association testing to examine the association between [~]1300 proteins and Multiple Sclerosis, using linear models adjusted for confounding covariates. We performed a range of sensitivity analyses and validated our findings in a semi-independent testing set. We then compared results across a range of other autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases within UK Biobank to evaluate disease specificity. Finally, associations with radiological lesion burden and brain volume were determined using a subset with available magnetic resonance imaging, using normalised T2-hyperintensity volume or whole brain volume as the outcome measure. 380 prevalent Multiple Sclerosis cases and 38,263 healthy controls were included. Cases and controls were reasonably well-matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation status. We discovered 100 proteins associated with Multiple Sclerosis at a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.05. The only proteins elevated in Multiple Sclerosis at this significance level were interleukin-15 and neurofilament light chain. 98 proteins were decreased in Multiple Sclerosis, including several integrin proteins and cystatin D. Suggestive (False Discovery Rate \u003c 1%) positive associations were found for an additional 13 proteins, including Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, interleukin-17 receptor beta, and the interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein. A substantial minority of these proteins, including cystatin D, were not associated with other autoimmune or neurodegenerative disorders and so could be considered MS-specific. We found evidence (P \u003c 0.05) for an association between higher serum Neurofilament Light Chain and T2 lesion load. We report the largest serum proteomic screen of Multiple Sclerosis, replicating important known associations and strengthening the evidence for the role of serum interleukin-15. While these findings require external validation, they demonstrate the power of biobank-scale datasets for discovering new biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis.\nAPOE loss-of-function variants: Compatible with longevity and associated with resistance to Alzheimer's Disease pathology\nAuthors: Chemparathy, A.; Le Guen, Y.; Chen, S.; Lee, E.-G.; Leong, L.; Gorzynski, J.; Xu, G.; Belloy, M.; Kasireddy, N.; Pena-Tauber, A.; Williams, K.; Stewart, I.; Wingo, T.; Lah, J.; Jayadev, S.; Hales, C.; Peskind, E.; Child, D. D.; Keene, C. D.; Cong, L.; Ashley, E.; Yu, C.-E.; Greicus, M.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292771\nThe {varepsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers Disease (AD). Knockdown of this allele may provide a therapeutic strategy for AD, but the effect of APOE loss-of-function (LoF) on AD pathogenesis is unknown. We searched for APOE LoF variants in a large cohort of older controls and patients with AD and identified six heterozygote carriers of APOE LoF variants. Five carriers were controls (ages 71-90) and one was an AD case with an unremarkable age-at-onset between 75-79. Two APOE {varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4 controls (Subjects 1 and 2) carried a stop-gain affecting the {varepsilon}4 allele. Subject 1 was cognitively normal at 90+ and had no neuritic plaques at autopsy. Subject 2 was cognitively healthy within the age range 75-79 and underwent lumbar puncture at between ages 75-79 with normal levels of amyloid. The results provide the strongest human genetics evidence yet available suggesting that {varepsilon}4 drives AD risk through a gain of abnormal function and support knockdown of APOE {varepsilon}4 or its protein product as a viable therapeutic option.\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Future Promises, Perils, and Practicalities.\nAuthors: salman, s.; Gu, Q.; Sharma, R.; Wei, Y.; Dherin, B.; Reddy, S.; Tawk, R.; Freeman, W. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.23292822\nAbstractO_ST_ABSIntroductionC_ST_ABSAneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a subtype of hemorrhagic stroke with thirty-day mortality as high as 40%. Given the expansion of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) methods in health care, SAH patients desperately need an integrated AI system that detects, segments, and supports clinical decisions based on presentation and severity. ObjectivesThis review aims to synthesize the current state of the art of AI and ML tools for the management of SAH patients alongside providing an up-to-date account of future horizons in patient care. MethodsWe performed a systematic review through various databases such as Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase. ResultsA total of 507 articles were identified. Following extensive revision, only 21 articles were relevant. Two studies reported improved mortality prediction using Glasgow Coma Scale and biomarkers such as Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and glucose. One study reported that ffANN is equal to the SAHIT and VASOGRADE scores. One study reported that metabolic biomarkers Ornithine, Symmetric Dimethylarginine, and Dimethylguanidine Valeric acid were associated with poor outcomes. Nine studies reported improved prediction of complications and reduction in latency until intervention using clinical scores and imaging. Four studies reported accurate prediction of aneurysmal rupture based on size, shape, and CNN. One study reported AI-assisted Robotic Transcranial Doppler as a substitute for clinicians. ConclusionAI/ML technologies possess tremendous potential in accelerating SAH systems-of- care. Keeping abreast of developments is vital in advancing timely interventions for critical diseases.\nRemote Digital Cognitive Assessment Reveals Cognitive Deficits Related to Hippocampal Atrophy in Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis\nAuthors: Shibata, K.; Attaallah, B.; Tai, X.-Y.; Trender, W.; Hellyer, P. J.; Hampshire, A.; Irani, S. R.; Manohar, S. G.; Husain, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23292765\nAutoimmune Limbic Encephalitis (ALE) is a neurological disease characterised by inflammation of the limbic regions of the brain, mediated by pathogenic autoantibodies. Because cognitive deficits persist following acute treatment of ALE, the accurate assessment of long-term cognitive outcomes is important for clinical assessments and trials. However, evaluating cognition is costly and an unmet need for validated digital methods exists. We investigated whether remote digital methods could identify previously characterised cognitive impairments in ALE patients and would correlate with standard neuropsychological assessment and hippocampal volume. The cognitive performance of 21 chronic ALE patients along with 54 age-matched healthy controls was assessed with a battery of 12 cognitive tasks from the Cognitron online platform. ALE patients performed significantly worse in memory, visuospatial abilities, executive function, and language. No impairments in digit \u0026 spatial span, target detection (attention) and emotion discrimination were observed. The global score on the online cognitive tasks correlated significantly with the established Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination III (ACE) pen-and-paper test. Deficits in visuospatial processing and language were identified in ALE compared to controls using remote digital testing but not the ACE, highlighting higher sensitivity of computerised testing to residual cognitive impairment. Finally, the hippocampal volume of ALE patients and healthy controls correlated with online cognitive scores. Overall, these findings demonstrate that remote, online testing may facilitate the characterisation of cognitive profiles in complex neurological diseases.\nBrain mechanisms explaining postural imbalance in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review\nAuthors: Hadi, Z.; Mahmud, M.; Seemungal, B. M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.23292709\nPersisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG. The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction. In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.\n",

During the early stages of PD, disruptions in the connectivity of multiple brain regions occur, which has prompted the study of PD as a network-level phenomenon. Our hypothesis is that by examining the relationship between brain connectivity and heartbeat dynamics, we can gain insight into the large-scale network disruptions and the neurophysiology of the disrupted interoceptive mechanisms in PD. Our results show that the coupling of fluctuating alpha and gamma connectivity with heartbeat dynamics is reduced in PD patients, as compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, we show that PD patients under dopamine medication recover part of the brain-heart coupling, in proportion with the reduced motor symptoms. Our proposal offers a promising approach to unveil the physiopathology of PD and promoting the development of new diagnostic methods for the early stages of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Discovery of serum protein biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis risk and severity could shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms, suggest new drug targets, enhance the speed of diagnosis, and improve risk stratification algorithms for use in clinical practice or in the identification of high-risk participants for prevention trials. Prior proteome-wide studies of Multiple Sclerosis have yielded inconsistent results due to small sample sizes. We aimed to describe serum protein biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis risk and to explore protein biomarkers of disease severity using radiological outcome measures. Multiple Sclerosis cases and controls were identified in UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort study of [~]500,000 British adults. Serum proteins were assayed in [~]50,000 UK Biobank participants using the Olink proximity extension assay. We performed case-control association testing to examine the association between [~]1300 proteins and Multiple Sclerosis, using linear models adjusted for confounding covariates. We performed a range of sensitivity analyses and validated our findings in a semi-independent testing set. We then compared results across a range of other autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases within UK Biobank to evaluate disease specificity. Finally, associations with radiological lesion burden and brain volume were determined using a subset with available magnetic resonance imaging, using normalised T2-hyperintensity volume or whole brain volume as the outcome measure. 380 prevalent Multiple Sclerosis cases and 38,263 healthy controls were included. Cases and controls were reasonably well-matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation status. We discovered 100 proteins associated with Multiple Sclerosis at a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.05. The only proteins elevated in Multiple Sclerosis at this significance level were interleukin-15 and neurofilament light chain. 98 proteins were decreased in Multiple Sclerosis, including several integrin proteins and cystatin D. Suggestive (False Discovery Rate &lt; 1%) positive associations were found for an additional 13 proteins, including Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, interleukin-17 receptor beta, and the interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein. A substantial minority of these proteins, including cystatin D, were not associated with other autoimmune or neurodegenerative disorders and so could be considered MS-specific. We found evidence (P &lt; 0.05) for an association between higher serum Neurofilament Light Chain and T2 lesion load. We report the largest serum proteomic screen of Multiple Sclerosis, replicating important known associations and strengthening the evidence for the role of serum interleukin-15. While these findings require external validation, they demonstrate the power of biobank-scale datasets for discovering new biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The {varepsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers Disease (AD). Knockdown of this allele may provide a therapeutic strategy for AD, but the effect of APOE loss-of-function (LoF) on AD pathogenesis is unknown. We searched for APOE LoF variants in a large cohort of older controls and patients with AD and identified six heterozygote carriers of APOE LoF variants. Five carriers were controls (ages 71-90) and one was an AD case with an unremarkable age-at-onset between 75-79. Two APOE {varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4 controls (Subjects 1 and 2) carried a stop-gain affecting the {varepsilon}4 allele. Subject 1 was cognitively normal at 90&#43; and had no neuritic plaques at autopsy. Subject 2 was cognitively healthy within the age range 75-79 and underwent lumbar puncture at between ages 75-79 with normal levels of amyloid. The results provide the strongest human genetics evidence yet available suggesting that {varepsilon}4 drives AD risk through a gain of abnormal function and support knockdown of APOE {varepsilon}4 or its protein product as a viable therapeutic option.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractO_ST_ABSIntroductionC_ST_ABSAneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a subtype of hemorrhagic stroke with thirty-day mortality as high as 40%. Given the expansion of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) methods in health care, SAH patients desperately need an integrated AI system that detects, segments, and supports clinical decisions based on presentation and severity.

ObjectivesThis review aims to synthesize the current state of the art of AI and ML tools for the management of SAH patients alongside providing an up-to-date account of future horizons in patient care.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review through various databases such as Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase.

ResultsA total of 507 articles were identified. Following extensive revision, only 21 articles were relevant. Two studies reported improved mortality prediction using Glasgow Coma Scale and biomarkers such as Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and glucose. One study reported that ffANN is equal to the SAHIT and VASOGRADE scores. One study reported that metabolic biomarkers Ornithine, Symmetric Dimethylarginine, and Dimethylguanidine Valeric acid were associated with poor outcomes. Nine studies reported improved prediction of complications and reduction in latency until intervention using clinical scores and imaging. Four studies reported accurate prediction of aneurysmal rupture based on size, shape, and CNN. One study reported AI-assisted Robotic Transcranial Doppler as a substitute for clinicians.

ConclusionAI/ML technologies possess tremendous potential in accelerating SAH systems-of- care. Keeping abreast of developments is vital in advancing timely interventions for critical diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis (ALE) is a neurological disease characterised by inflammation of the limbic regions of the brain, mediated by pathogenic autoantibodies. Because cognitive deficits persist following acute treatment of ALE, the accurate assessment of long-term cognitive outcomes is important for clinical assessments and trials. However, evaluating cognition is costly and an unmet need for validated digital methods exists. We investigated whether remote digital methods could identify previously characterised cognitive impairments in ALE patients and would correlate with standard neuropsychological assessment and hippocampal volume. The cognitive performance of 21 chronic ALE patients along with 54 age-matched healthy controls was assessed with a battery of 12 cognitive tasks from the Cognitron online platform. ALE patients performed significantly worse in memory, visuospatial abilities, executive function, and language. No impairments in digit &amp; spatial span, target detection (attention) and emotion discrimination were observed. The global score on the online cognitive tasks correlated significantly with the established Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination III (ACE) pen-and-paper test. Deficits in visuospatial processing and language were identified in ALE compared to controls using remote digital testing but not the ACE, highlighting higher sensitivity of computerised testing to residual cognitive impairment. Finally, the hippocampal volume of ALE patients and healthy controls correlated with online cognitive scores. Overall, these findings demonstrate that remote, online testing may facilitate the characterisation of cognitive profiles in complex neurological diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Persisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature.

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG.

The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.</p>
