A.; Williams Gray, C. H.; Passamonti, L.; Robbins, T.; Rowe, J.; O'Callaghan, C.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300879\nNoradrenaline is a powerful modulator of cognitive processes, including action-decisions underlying saccadic control. Changes in saccadic eye movements are common across neurodegenerative diseases of ageing, including Parkinsons disease. With growing interest in noradrenergic treatment potential for non-motor symptoms in Parkinsons disease, the temporal precision of oculomotor function is advantageous to assess the effects of this modulation. Here we studied the effect of 40 mg atomoxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, in nineteen people with idiopathic Parkinsons disease using a single dose, randomised double-blind crossover placebo-controlled design. Twenty-five healthy adult participants completed the assessments to provide normative data. Participants performed prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. The latency, velocity and accuracy of saccades, and resting pupil diameter, were measured. Increased pupil diameter on the drug confirmed its expected effect on the locus coeruleus ascending arousal system. Atomoxetine improved key aspects of saccade performance: prosaccade latencies were faster and the saccadic main sequence was normalised. These improvements were accompanied by increased antisaccade error rates on the drug. Together these findings suggest a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off for visuo-motor decisions in response to noradrenergic treatment. Our results provide new evidence to substantiate a role for noradrenergic modulation of saccades, and based on known circuitry we advance the hypothesis that this reflects modulation at the level of the locus coeruleus-superior colliculus pathway. Given the potential for noradrenergic treatment of non-motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease and related conditions, the oculomotor system can support the assessment of cognitive effects without limb-motor confounds on task performance.\nThe use of continuous brain parenchymal impedance dispersion to measure glymphatic function in humans\nAuthors: Dagum, P.; Giovangrandi, L.; Levendovszky, S. R.; Winebaum, J. J.; Singh, T.; Cho, Y.; Kaplan, R. M.; Jaffe, M. S.; Lim, M. M.; Vandeweerd, C.; Iliff, J. J.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.24300933\nGlymphatic function in animal models supports the clearance of brain proteins whose mis-aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The measurement of glymphatic function in the human brain has been elusive, limiting its potential in translational research. Here we described a non-invasive multimodal device for the first-in-human continuous measurement of glymphatic function using repeated electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Through two separate clinical validation studies, the device captured sleep-active glymphatic function. Device measurements successfully (i) paralleled sleep-associated changes in extracellular volume that regulate glymphatic exchange, (ii) replicated preclinical findings showing glymphatic function is increased with increasing sleep EEG delta power, and is decreased with increasing sleep EEG beta power and heart rate, and (iii) predicted glymphatic solute exchange measured by contrast enhanced MRI. The present investigational device permits the continuous and time-resolved assessment of glymphatic function in naturalistic settings necessary to determine the contribution of glymphatic impairment to risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease, and to enable target-engagement studies that modulate glymphatic function in humans.\nPlasma p-tau212: antemortem diagnostic performance and prediction of autopsy verification of Alzheimers disease neuropathology\nAuthors: Kac, P. R.; Gonzalez-Ortiz, F.; Emersic, A.; Dulewicz, M.; Koutarapu, S.; Turton, M.; An, Y.; Smirnov, D.; Kulczynska-Przybik, A.; Varma, V.; Ashton, N. J.; Montoliu-Gaya, L.; Camporesi, E.; Winkel, I.; Paradowski, B.; Moghekar, A.; Troncoso, J. C.; Brinkmalm, G.; Resnick, S. M.; Mroczko, B.; Kvartsberg, H.; Gregoric-Kramberger, M.; Hanrieder, J.; Cucnik, S.; Harrison, P.; Zetterberg, H.; Lewczuk, P.; Thambisetty, M.; Rot, U.; Galasko, D.; Blennow, K.; Karikari, T. K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299806\nBlood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Thereafter, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n=388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205. These findings support plasma p-tau212 as a novel peripherally accessible biomarker of AD pathophysiology.\nNeuroimaging markers of patient-reported outcome measures in acute ischemic stroke\nAuthors: Oliveira, L. C.; Bonkhoff, A. K.; Regenhardt, R. W.; Alhadid, K.; Tuozzo, C.; Etherton, M. R.; Rost, N. S.; Schirmer, M. D.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299829\nObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables. ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores. ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.\nOnset of Alzheimer disease in apolipoprotein ε4 carriers is earlier in butyrylcholinesterase K variant carriers\nAuthors: Lane, R. M.; Darreh-Shori, T.; Junge, C.; Li, D.; Yang, Q. M.; Edwards, A.; Graham, D.; Moore, K.; Mummery, C. J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300718\nBackgroundWe wished to examine the impact of the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) carrier status on age-at-diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers. MethodsIn 45 patients, aged 50-74 years, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker confirmed mild AD, recruited into a clinical trial (NCT03186989), baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and biomarkers were evaluated by BCHE-K and APOE4 allelic status. ResultsIn APOE4 carriers (N = 33), mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in BCHE-K carriers (n = 11) was 6.4 years earlier than in BCHE-K noncarriers (n = 22, P \u003c .001, ANOVA). In APOE4 noncarriers (N = 12) there was no similar influence of BCHE-K. In APOE4 carriers with versus those without BCHE-K, mean age-at-baseline was over 6 years earlier and accompanied by slightly higher amyloid and tau accumulations. A predominant amyloid, limited tau pathophysiology, and limbic-amnestic phenotype was exemplified by APOE4 homozygotes with BCHE-K. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated association of amyloid accumulation with APOE4 carrier status (P \u003c .029), larger total brain ventricle volume (P \u003c .021), less synaptic injury (Ng, P \u003c .001), and less tau (p-tau181, P \u003c .005). In contrast, tau pathophysiology was associated with more neuroaxonal damage (NfL, P = .002), more synaptic injury (Ng, P \u003c .001), and higher levels of glial activation (YKL-40, P = .01). ConclusionFindings concern the genetic architecture of prognosis in early AD, that is fundamental for patients and the design of clinical trials, and that is less well established than the genetics of susceptibility. In mild AD patients aged less than 75 years, the mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in APOE4 carriers was reduced by over 6 years in BCHE-K carriers versus noncarriers. Functional activation of glia may explain much of the effects of APOE4 and BCHE-K on the phenotype of early AD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Glymphatic function in animal models supports the clearance of brain proteins whose mis-aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s disease. The measurement of glymphatic function in the human brain has been elusive, limiting its potential in translational research. Here we described a non-invasive multimodal device for the first-in-human continuous measurement of glymphatic function using repeated electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Through two separate clinical validation studies, the device captured sleep-active glymphatic function. Device measurements successfully (i) paralleled sleep-associated changes in extracellular volume that regulate glymphatic exchange, (ii) replicated preclinical findings showing glymphatic function is increased with increasing sleep EEG delta power, and is decreased with increasing sleep EEG beta power and heart rate, and (iii) predicted glymphatic solute exchange measured by contrast enhanced MRI. The present investigational device permits the continuous and time-resolved assessment of glymphatic function in naturalistic settings necessary to determine the contribution of glymphatic impairment to risk and progression of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and to enable target-engagement studies that modulate glymphatic function in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Thereafter, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n=388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205. These findings support plasma p-tau212 as a novel peripherally accessible biomarker of AD pathophysiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables.

ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores.

ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe wished to examine the impact of the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) carrier status on age-at-diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers.

MethodsIn 45 patients, aged 50-74 years, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker confirmed mild AD, recruited into a clinical trial (NCT03186989), baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and biomarkers were evaluated by BCHE-K and APOE4 allelic status.

ResultsIn APOE4 carriers (N = 33), mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in BCHE-K carriers (n = 11) was 6.4 years earlier than in BCHE-K noncarriers (n = 22, P &lt; .001, ANOVA). In APOE4 noncarriers (N = 12) there was no similar influence of BCHE-K. In APOE4 carriers with versus those without BCHE-K, mean age-at-baseline was over 6 years earlier and accompanied by slightly higher amyloid and tau accumulations. A predominant amyloid, limited tau pathophysiology, and limbic-amnestic phenotype was exemplified by APOE4 homozygotes with BCHE-K. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated association of amyloid accumulation with APOE4 carrier status (P &lt; .029), larger total brain ventricle volume (P &lt; .021), less synaptic injury (Ng, P &lt; .001), and less tau (p-tau181, P &lt; .005). In contrast, tau pathophysiology was associated with more neuroaxonal damage (NfL, P = .002), more synaptic injury (Ng, P &lt; .001), and higher levels of glial activation (YKL-40, P = .01).

ConclusionFindings concern the genetic architecture of prognosis in early AD, that is fundamental for patients and the design of clinical trials, and that is less well established than the genetics of susceptibility. In mild AD patients aged less than 75 years, the mean age-at-diagnosis of AD in APOE4 carriers was reduced by over 6 years in BCHE-K carriers versus noncarriers. Functional activation of glia may explain much of the effects of APOE4 and BCHE-K on the phenotype of early AD.</p>
