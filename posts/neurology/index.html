Melanized neurons in SNc can be visualized in vivo using magnetization transfer (MT) effects. Nigral volume was extracted in data acquired with a MT-prepared gradient echo sequence in 33 controls, 83 non-manifest carriers (42 LRRK2 and 41 GBA nonmanifest carriers), 65 prodromal hyposmic participants, 105 de novo PD patients and 26 48-month PD patients from the Parkinsons Progressive Markers Initiative. No difference in nigral volume was seen between controls and LRRK2 and GBA non-manifest carriers (F=0.076; P=0.927). A significant main effect in group was observed between controls, prodromal hyposmic participants, and overt PD patients (F=5.192; P=0.002). Longer disease duration significantly correlated with lower nigral volume (r=-0.252; P=0.010). This study shows that nigral depigmentation can be robustly detected in prodromal hyposmic participants and overt PD patients.\nAssessing Clinical Progression Measures in Alzheimer's Disease Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: McLaughlin, J.; Scotton, W.; Hardy, J.; Shoai, M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294771\nClinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression. In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}+) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs. SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disease. It is now widely recognised that there is a pre-clinical phase. This phase of the disease may be apparent via biomarker testing up to 20 years before clinically evident AD. Pre-clinical AD is then followed by clinically significant cognitive decline ranging from MCI to severe AD. The aim of randomised controlled trials (RCT) is to reduce or halt the rate of clinical progression of AD. Most of these trials have been unsuccessful. To determine the effectiveness of treatments there must be robust and reliable tools for measuring AD progression. For at least 30 years there has been recognition that the measures of progression used in AD clinical trials are problematic. A significant concern is that current measures of clinical progression are potentially not sensitive enough in early and preclinical stages of AD and so are not reliable indicators of AD progression. In this systematic review and meta-regression we aimed to assess the precision of measurements of clinical progression in AD clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. MethodsMeta analyses of RCTs in AD with amyloid positive status (A{beta}+) as an inclusion criterion was undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0 and the metafor and emmeans libraries. FindingsOf the progression measures commonly reported in RCTs, the FAQ, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE. Other cognitive measures were amongst the least sensitive measures over the chosen time period. As a composite score, both the iADRS and CDRSB appear to be performing better than the cognitive components they comprise. The neuropsychiatric battery analysed in this study appeared to be the least sensitive of measures of progression. InterpretationFunctional measures, with the exception of QoL-AD, perform better than other groups of measures. Measures which rely on purely cognitive domains are not optimal for sole use in AD trials. Ideally, measures should include both cognitive and functional components to enhance sensitivity. New composite measures address the poorer performance of composite scores, as compared to their comprising functional measures, by assigning different weights to cognitive and functional change.\nGeneralisability of epileptiform patterns across time and patients\nAuthors: Karimi-Rouzbahani, H.; McGonigal, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294708\nComplexity of epileptogenic zone (EZ) localisation contributes to failure of surgical resection to produce seizure freedom. This is to some extent a result of distinct patterns of epileptiform activity between (i.e., interictal) and during seizures (i.e., ictal) and their diversity across patients. This often leads to suboptimal localisation based on inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) features. We asked two under-investigated questions. First, whether neural signal reflecting epileptogenicity would be generalisable from interictal to ictal time window within each patient. This would be critical for patients who are monitored in hospital without having a seizure to help with EZ localisation, and more generally for understanding the predictive power of resting state (interictal) EEG data in determining EZ. Second, whether epileptiform patterns would generalise across patients, and if so, which aspects of those patterns are the most generalisable. We used an intracranial EEG dataset that included fifty-five patients with lesional and non-lesional pathology, who had subsequently undergone cortical resection in frontal or temporal lobe with different levels of seizure freedom. We extracted a large set of simple to complex features from stereo-EEG (SEEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) neural signals recorded during interictal and ictal time windows. We fed those features to decision-tree classifiers for EZ localisation and to quantify the diversity of ictal and interictal epileptiform patterns through a cross-time and cross-patient generalisation procedure. We observed significant evidence (Bayes factor \u003e\u003e 10) for generalisability of patterns from interictal to ictal time windows across patients, which were dominantly reflected in signal power and high-frequency network-based features. Majority of patients showed consistent patterns of epileptogenicity across interictal and ictal time windows, reflected in above-chance area-under-curve (mean AUC = 0.6). We observed significant evidence (Bayes factor \u003e\u003e 10) that signal features of epileptogenic regions could generalise across patients in both interictal and ictal time windows with significant evidence for higher generalisability in ictal than interictal time window (mean AUC 0.75 vs. 0.59; Bayes factor \u003e\u003e 10). While signal power and moment features were the most contributory to the cross-patient generalisation in the interictal window, signal complexity features were the most contributory in the ictal window. These results provide new insights about features of epileptic neural activity that generalise across interictal-ictal time windows and patients, which can have implications for both qualitative and quantitative EZ localisation. The explainable machine-learning pipeline developed here can guide future developments in epilepsy investigations.\nCharacterizing the Extended Language Network in Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis\nAuthors: Ratzan, A. S.; Simani, L.; Dworkin, J. D.; Buyukturkoglu, K. S.; Riley, C. S.; Leavitt, V. M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294843\nBackground: Cognitive impairment is a pervasive, functionally limiting symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system that is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults. Recently, language dysfunction has received increased attention as a prevalent and early affected cognitive domain in individuals with MS. Objectives: To establish a network-level model of language dysfunction in MS. Methods: Cognitive data and 3T structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 54 MS patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs). Summary measures of the extended language network (ELN) and structural imaging metrics were calculated. Group differences in ELN summary measures were evaluated. Associations between ELN summary measures and language performance were assessed in both groups; in the MS group, a two-step regression analysis was applied to assess relationships between additional language-specific imaging measures and language performance. Results: In comparison to the HC group, the MS group performed significantly worse on the semantic fluency and rapid automized naming tests (p \u003c 0.005). Concerning the ELN summary measures, the MS group exhibited higher within-ELN connectivity than the HCs (0.11 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.01, p \u003c 0.05, respectively). While no significant relationships between ELN summary measures and language function were observed in either group, the regression analysis identified a set of 17 imaging features that predicted performance on the rapid automized naming test (p \u003c 0.05) and identified key white matter tracts predicting language function in individuals with MS. Conclusion: The derived functional network-level measures, combined with the identified structural neuroimaging metrics, constitute a comprehensive set of imaging features to characterize language dysfunction in MS. Further studies leveraging these features may uncover underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant predictors of language dysfunction, potentially leading to improved precision treatment strategies for cognitively impaired patients with multiple sclerosis.\nPersonalized chronic adaptive deep brain stimulation outperforms conventional stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Oehrn, C. R.; Cernera, S.; Hammer, L. H.; Shcherbakova, M.; Yao, J.; Hahn, A.; Wang, S.; Ostrem, J. L.; Little, S.; Starr, P. A.\nScore: 23.7, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293450\n1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of \"adaptive\" neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.\n",

Nigral volume was extracted in data acquired with a MT-prepared gradient echo sequence in 33 controls, 83 non-manifest carriers (42 LRRK2 and 41 GBA nonmanifest carriers), 65 prodromal hyposmic participants, 105 de novo PD patients and 26 48-month PD patients from the Parkinsons Progressive Markers Initiative. No difference in nigral volume was seen between controls and LRRK2 and GBA non-manifest carriers (F=0.076; P=0.927). A significant main effect in group was observed between controls, prodromal hyposmic participants, and overt PD patients (F=5.192; P=0.002). Longer disease duration significantly correlated with lower nigral volume (r=-0.252; P=0.010). This study shows that nigral depigmentation can be robustly detected in prodromal hyposmic participants and overt PD patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression.

In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry.

Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}&#43;) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs.

SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disease. It is now widely recognised that there is a pre-clinical phase. This phase of the disease may be apparent via biomarker testing up to 20 years before clinically evident AD. Pre-clinical AD is then followed by clinically significant cognitive decline ranging from MCI to severe AD.

The aim of randomised controlled trials (RCT) is to reduce or halt the rate of clinical progression of AD. Most of these trials have been unsuccessful. To determine the effectiveness of treatments there must be robust and reliable tools for measuring AD progression. For at least 30 years there has been recognition that the measures of progression used in AD clinical trials are problematic.

A significant concern is that current measures of clinical progression are potentially not sensitive enough in early and preclinical stages of AD and so are not reliable indicators of AD progression.

In this systematic review and meta-regression we aimed to assess the precision of measurements of clinical progression in AD clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry.

MethodsMeta analyses of RCTs in AD with amyloid positive status (A{beta}&#43;) as an inclusion criterion was undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0 and the metafor and emmeans libraries.

FindingsOf the progression measures commonly reported in RCTs, the FAQ, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE. Other cognitive measures were amongst the least sensitive measures over the chosen time period. As a composite score, both the iADRS and CDRSB appear to be performing better than the cognitive components they comprise. The neuropsychiatric battery analysed in this study appeared to be the least sensitive of measures of progression.

InterpretationFunctional measures, with the exception of QoL-AD, perform better than other groups of measures. Measures which rely on purely cognitive domains are not optimal for sole use in AD trials. Ideally, measures should include both cognitive and functional components to enhance sensitivity. New composite measures address the poorer performance of composite scores, as compared to their comprising functional measures, by assigning different weights to cognitive and functional change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Complexity of epileptogenic zone (EZ) localisation contributes to failure of surgical resection to produce seizure freedom. This is to some extent a result of distinct patterns of epileptiform activity between (i.e., interictal) and during seizures (i.e., ictal) and their diversity across patients. This often leads to suboptimal localisation based on inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) features. We asked two under-investigated questions. First, whether neural signal reflecting epileptogenicity would be generalisable from interictal to ictal time window within each patient. This would be critical for patients who are monitored in hospital without having a seizure to help with EZ localisation, and more generally for understanding the predictive power of resting state (interictal) EEG data in determining EZ. Second, whether epileptiform patterns would generalise across patients, and if so, which aspects of those patterns are the most generalisable. We used an intracranial EEG dataset that included fifty-five patients with lesional and non-lesional pathology, who had subsequently undergone cortical resection in frontal or temporal lobe with different levels of seizure freedom. We extracted a large set of simple to complex features from stereo-EEG (SEEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) neural signals recorded during interictal and ictal time windows. We fed those features to decision-tree classifiers for EZ localisation and to quantify the diversity of ictal and interictal epileptiform patterns through a cross-time and cross-patient generalisation procedure. We observed significant evidence (Bayes factor &gt;&gt; 10) for generalisability of patterns from interictal to ictal time windows across patients, which were dominantly reflected in signal power and high-frequency network-based features. Majority of patients showed consistent patterns of epileptogenicity across interictal and ictal time windows, reflected in above-chance area-under-curve (mean AUC = 0.6). We observed significant evidence (Bayes factor &gt;&gt; 10) that signal features of epileptogenic regions could generalise across patients in both interictal and ictal time windows with significant evidence for higher generalisability in ictal than interictal time window (mean AUC 0.75 vs. 0.59; Bayes factor &gt;&gt; 10). While signal power and moment features were the most contributory to the cross-patient generalisation in the interictal window, signal complexity features were the most contributory in the ictal window. These results provide new insights about features of epileptic neural activity that generalise across interictal-ictal time windows and patients, which can have implications for both qualitative and quantitative EZ localisation. The explainable machine-learning pipeline developed here can guide future developments in epilepsy investigations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Cognitive impairment is a pervasive, functionally limiting symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system that is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults. Recently, language dysfunction has received increased attention as a prevalent and early affected cognitive domain in individuals with MS. Objectives: To establish a network-level model of language dysfunction in MS. Methods: Cognitive data and 3T structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 54 MS patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs). Summary measures of the extended language network (ELN) and structural imaging metrics were calculated. Group differences in ELN summary measures were evaluated. Associations between ELN summary measures and language performance were assessed in both groups; in the MS group, a two-step regression analysis was applied to assess relationships between additional language-specific imaging measures and language performance. Results: In comparison to the HC group, the MS group performed significantly worse on the semantic fluency and rapid automized naming tests (p &lt; 0.005). Concerning the ELN summary measures, the MS group exhibited higher within-ELN connectivity than the HCs (0.11 &#43;/- 0.02 vs. 0.10 &#43;/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). While no significant relationships between ELN summary measures and language function were observed in either group, the regression analysis identified a set of 17 imaging features that predicted performance on the rapid automized naming test (p &lt; 0.05) and identified key white matter tracts predicting language function in individuals with MS. Conclusion: The derived functional network-level measures, combined with the identified structural neuroimaging metrics, constitute a comprehensive set of imaging features to characterize language dysfunction in MS. Further studies leveraging these features may uncover underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant predictors of language dysfunction, potentially leading to improved precision treatment strategies for cognitively impaired patients with multiple sclerosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of &#34;adaptive&#34; neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.</p>
