While numerous studies have explored the occurrence and consequences of neurological issues in COVID-19, they have often involved limited sample sizes. PurposeThis paper aims to determine the overall occurrence of neurological complications in COVID-19, examine their links with patient demographics, and assess their impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, it seeks to provide an overview of the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms. MethodologyTwo systematic reviews were conducted to investigate acute and chronic neurological complications associated with COVID-19. A comprehensive search of medical databases was performed, and relevant studies were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with subgroup analysis and meta-regression used to assess heterogeneity. ResultsThe analysis of acute complications included 20,011 patients with an average age of 58.1 years and a slight male predominance (55.2%). Common neurological symptoms included loss of taste and smell, headaches, acute encephalopathy, and stroke. For the analysis of long-term complications, 2,094 patients were included. Survivors of COVID-19 experienced ongoing neurological issues ranging from sensory impairments to fatigue, headaches, strokes, and even cognitive and psychiatric problems. ConclusionBy examining various neurological symptoms, this study found a significant association between these manifestations and worse overall outcomes, especially in patients over 60 years old. Identifying high-risk individuals and maintaining a high level of suspicion are crucial for enhancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, validating biomarkers, and improving the management of these neurological issues.\nDiminished utility of fMRI subsequent memory models with increasing severity across the Alzheimer's disease risk spectrum\nAuthors: Soch, J.; Richter, A.; Kizilirmak, J.

H.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295362\nIn functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, episodic memory is commonly investigated with the subsequent memory paradigm in which brain activity is recorded during encoding and analyzed as a function of subsequent remembering and forgetting. Impaired episodic memory is common in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), but only few studies have reported subsequent memory effects in AD or its risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One reason for this might be that subsequent memory responses may be blunted in AD or MCI and thus less likely to manifest in fMRI signal differences. Here, we used Bayesian model selection of single-subject fMRI general linear models (GLMs) for a visual novelty and memory encoding experiment to compare the model performance of categorical and parametric subsequent memory models as well as memory-invariant models in a clinical cohort (N = 468) comprising healthy controls (HC) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and AD, plus healthy relatives of AD patients (AD-rel). We could replicate the previously reported superiority of parametric subsequent memory models over categorical models (Soch et al., 2021a) in the HC and also in the SCD and AD-rel groups. However, memory-invariant models outperformed any model assuming subsequent memory effects in the MCI and AD groups. In the AD group, we additionally found substantially lower model preference for models assuming novelty compared to models not differentiating between novel and familiar stimuli. Our results suggest that voxel-wise memory-related fMRI activity patterns in AD and also MCI should be interpreted with caution and point to the need for additional or alternative approaches to investigate memory function.\nQuantitative assessment of head movement dynamics in dystonia using visual perceptive deep learning: a multi-centre retrospective longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Peach, R.; Friedrich, M.; Fronemann, L.; Muthuraman, M.; Schreglmann, S. R.; Zeller, D.; Schrader, C.; Krauss, J.; Schnitzler, A.; Wittstock, M.; Helmers, A.-K.; Paschen, S.; Kuhn, A.; Skogseid, I. M.; Eisner, W.; Mueller, J.; Matthies, C.; Reich, M.; Volkmann, J.; Ip, C. W.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295260\nBackgroundDystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterised by abnormal involuntary movements and postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for dystonia rely on simplified rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the impact of therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an efficient and accurate method that is rater-independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. MethodsTo evaluate the framework, we leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort studies across seven academic centres in Germany. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical validation and derived kinematic variables reflecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was validated in a fully independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients. FindingsComputer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with clinically assigned scores, outperforming previous approaches employing specialised camera equipment. Across comparisons, we discovered a consistent set of kinematic features derived from full video assessments, which encoded information relevant to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural circuit intervention more strongly and independently of static head angle deviations predominantly used for scoring. InterpretationThe proposed visual perceptive machine learning framework reveals kinematic pathosignatures of dystonia which may be utilized to augment clinical management, facilitate scientific translation and inform personalised and precision approaches in Neurology. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSClinical assessment of dystonia, a neurological movement disorder, has traditionally relied on rating scales that aim to simplify complex phenomenology into lowerdimensional rating items. However, these score-based assessments have significant clinimetric limitations and do not fully capture the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of dystonic phenomena, which are crucial for clinical judgment and pathophysiological understanding. In contrast, recent investigations in animal models of dystonia have already demonstrated the utility and relevance of quantitative methods for phenotyping, which gradually supersedes previous observer-dependent behavioural analyses. Taken together, this has led to a need for more objective and detailed clinical evaluation methods of dystonia. We performed a PubMed search up to July 2023 combining the terms \"dystonia\" AND (\"deep learning\" OR \"machine learning\" or \"computer vision\" OR \"vision-based\" OR \"video-based\") AND (\"angle\" OR \"kinematic\" OR \"rating\" OR \"scoring\" OR \"movement analysis\") including abstracts in English or German. The search yielded three studies that validated vision-based frameworks for automating the assessment of cervical dystonia severity compared to clinician-annotated ratings. Two of these studies focused on deriving head angle deviations from specialised camera setups, while the third study utilised computer vision in a retrospective video dataset recorded using conventional equipment. These studies reported fair to moderately strong correlations between vision-based head angle measurements and clinical scores. Additionally, two studies investigated computer vision for assessing head tremor in the context of cervical dystonia: one single case report demonstrated the clinical validity of computer vision-derived head angle and head tremor metrics, while a retrospective cross-sectional study reported moderately strong clinical agreement of computer vision-derived head oscillation metrics across different dystonia subgroups. Two additional studies used computer visionbased kinematics to quantify dystonia-like phenomena in rodent models of monogenetic dystonia, demonstrating utility in both phenotype and genotype predictions. However, most of the clinical studies were limited to static task conditions, where patients attempted to hold a neutral position of the head, thus not providing a naturalistic account of dystonia. Moreover, beyond head angular deviations and oscillation metrics, no study explored a broader kinematic feature space that reflects the true spatiotemporal complexity of dystonic movements. Additionally, the studies assessed patients at single time points without considering different therapy conditions, particularly the effects of deep brain stimulation, which is a highly effective intervention targeting brain circuits. Nor did they compare dystonia sub-types, such as cervical and generalised systonia. Added value of this studyIn this study, we present a comprehensive visual perceptive deep learning framework that addresses the gaps in current dystonia assessments. We use this framework to retrospectively analyse a unique dataset from three multi-centric, studies encompassing video examinations of patients along the dystonic severity continuum, including different deep brain stimulation states. Our framework goes beyond the automation of suboptimal symptom severity assessments by reverse engineering a set of clinically inspired kinematic features. The resulting high dimensional, yet intuitively interpretable kinematic feature space enabled us to explore disease states and effects of brain circuit therapies in a level of detail comparable to experimental neuroscientific investigations. Through a data-driven approach, we have identified a consistent set of only four dynamic parameters that encode dystonia severity, subtype, and the efficacy of brain circuit interventions. Notably, these features are independent of static head angle deviations, which play a central role in dystonia severity scores, pointing to the involvement of partially distinct neurobiological processes not captured by these scores. Our findings align with emerging concepts of symptom-specific brain circuits and findings in rodent models of dystonia, thereby exemplifying the visual perceptive frameworks potential to augment clinical management and bridge translational gaps in movement disorders research. By providing a more comprehensive and precise assessment of the disorder, our study offers valuable insights for improved treatment strategies and further understanding of dystonias complex neurobiology. Implications of all the available evidenceThe available evidence collectively underscores the limitations of traditional rating scales in capturing the informative spatiotemporal dynamics of dystonic movements, emphasizing the need for more objective and granular evaluation methods. In line with recent animal studies using computer vision for dystonia quantification, recent clinical studies have shown the potential of computer vision-based frameworks in automating cervical dystonia severity assessment and capturing head tremor metrics. However, their underlying study designs may inadvertently reinforce limitations associated with the clinical scoring process. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive visual perceptive deep learning framework that serves as a powerful platform to augment clinical judgement and generate valuable pathophysiological insights by extracting a set of clinically inspired, interpretable kinematic features. Our findings have implications beyond dystonia, showcasing the utility of visual perceptive frameworks in enhancing clinical management and fostering integration with advanced neuroimaging and neurotechnological methods. This study opens doors for future translational research to explore the broader application of computer vision and deep learning techniques to derive kinematic signatures of movement disorders across species and experimental conditions, promising more precise and personalised assessments that can significantly improve therapeutic strategies and patient outcomes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, episodic memory is commonly investigated with the subsequent memory paradigm in which brain activity is recorded during encoding and analyzed as a function of subsequent remembering and forgetting. Impaired episodic memory is common in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), but only few studies have reported subsequent memory effects in AD or its risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One reason for this might be that subsequent memory responses may be blunted in AD or MCI and thus less likely to manifest in fMRI signal differences. Here, we used Bayesian model selection of single-subject fMRI general linear models (GLMs) for a visual novelty and memory encoding experiment to compare the model performance of categorical and parametric subsequent memory models as well as memory-invariant models in a clinical cohort (N = 468) comprising healthy controls (HC) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and AD, plus healthy relatives of AD patients (AD-rel). We could replicate the previously reported superiority of parametric subsequent memory models over categorical models (Soch et al., 2021a) in the HC and also in the SCD and AD-rel groups. However, memory-invariant models outperformed any model assuming subsequent memory effects in the MCI and AD groups. In the AD group, we additionally found substantially lower model preference for models assuming novelty compared to models not differentiating between novel and familiar stimuli. Our results suggest that voxel-wise memory-related fMRI activity patterns in AD and also MCI should be interpreted with caution and point to the need for additional or alternative approaches to investigate memory function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterised by abnormal involuntary movements and postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for dystonia rely on simplified rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the impact of therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an efficient and accurate method that is rater-independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients.

MethodsTo evaluate the framework, we leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort studies across seven academic centres in Germany. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical validation and derived kinematic variables reflecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was validated in a fully independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients.

FindingsComputer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with clinically assigned scores, outperforming previous approaches employing specialised camera equipment. Across comparisons, we discovered a consistent set of kinematic features derived from full video assessments, which encoded information relevant to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural circuit intervention more strongly and independently of static head angle deviations predominantly used for scoring.

InterpretationThe proposed visual perceptive machine learning framework reveals kinematic pathosignatures of dystonia which may be utilized to augment clinical management, facilitate scientific translation and inform personalised and precision approaches in Neurology.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSClinical assessment of dystonia, a neurological movement disorder, has traditionally relied on rating scales that aim to simplify complex phenomenology into lowerdimensional rating items. However, these score-based assessments have significant clinimetric limitations and do not fully capture the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of dystonic phenomena, which are crucial for clinical judgment and pathophysiological understanding. In contrast, recent investigations in animal models of dystonia have already demonstrated the utility and relevance of quantitative methods for phenotyping, which gradually supersedes previous observer-dependent behavioural analyses. Taken together, this has led to a need for more objective and detailed clinical evaluation methods of dystonia.

We performed a PubMed search up to July 2023 combining the terms &#34;dystonia&#34; AND (&#34;deep learning&#34; OR &#34;machine learning&#34; or &#34;computer vision&#34; OR &#34;vision-based&#34; OR &#34;video-based&#34;) AND (&#34;angle&#34; OR &#34;kinematic&#34; OR &#34;rating&#34; OR &#34;scoring&#34; OR &#34;movement analysis&#34;) including abstracts in English or German. The search yielded three studies that validated vision-based frameworks for automating the assessment of cervical dystonia severity compared to clinician-annotated ratings. Two of these studies focused on deriving head angle deviations from specialised camera setups, while the third study utilised computer vision in a retrospective video dataset recorded using conventional equipment. These studies reported fair to moderately strong correlations between vision-based head angle measurements and clinical scores. Additionally, two studies investigated computer vision for assessing head tremor in the context of cervical dystonia: one single case report demonstrated the clinical validity of computer vision-derived head angle and head tremor metrics, while a retrospective cross-sectional study reported moderately strong clinical agreement of computer vision-derived head oscillation metrics across different dystonia subgroups. Two additional studies used computer visionbased kinematics to quantify dystonia-like phenomena in rodent models of monogenetic dystonia, demonstrating utility in both phenotype and genotype predictions.

However, most of the clinical studies were limited to static task conditions, where patients attempted to hold a neutral position of the head, thus not providing a naturalistic account of dystonia. Moreover, beyond head angular deviations and oscillation metrics, no study explored a broader kinematic feature space that reflects the true spatiotemporal complexity of dystonic movements. Additionally, the studies assessed patients at single time points without considering different therapy conditions, particularly the effects of deep brain stimulation, which is a highly effective intervention targeting brain circuits. Nor did they compare dystonia sub-types, such as cervical and generalised systonia.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we present a comprehensive visual perceptive deep learning framework that addresses the gaps in current dystonia assessments. We use this framework to retrospectively analyse a unique dataset from three multi-centric, studies encompassing video examinations of patients along the dystonic severity continuum, including different deep brain stimulation states. Our framework goes beyond the automation of suboptimal symptom severity assessments by reverse engineering a set of clinically inspired kinematic features. The resulting high dimensional, yet intuitively interpretable kinematic feature space enabled us to explore disease states and effects of brain circuit therapies in a level of detail comparable to experimental neuroscientific investigations. Through a data-driven approach, we have identified a consistent set of only four dynamic parameters that encode dystonia severity, subtype, and the efficacy of brain circuit interventions. Notably, these features are independent of static head angle deviations, which play a central role in dystonia severity scores, pointing to the involvement of partially distinct neurobiological processes not captured by these scores. Our findings align with emerging concepts of symptom-specific brain circuits and findings in rodent models of dystonia, thereby exemplifying the visual perceptive frameworks potential to augment clinical management and bridge translational gaps in movement disorders research. By providing a more comprehensive and precise assessment of the disorder, our study offers valuable insights for improved treatment strategies and further understanding of dystonias complex neurobiology.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe available evidence collectively underscores the limitations of traditional rating scales in capturing the informative spatiotemporal dynamics of dystonic movements, emphasizing the need for more objective and granular evaluation methods. In line with recent animal studies using computer vision for dystonia quantification, recent clinical studies have shown the potential of computer vision-based frameworks in automating cervical dystonia severity assessment and capturing head tremor metrics. However, their underlying study designs may inadvertently reinforce limitations associated with the clinical scoring process.

In this study, we introduce a comprehensive visual perceptive deep learning framework that serves as a powerful platform to augment clinical judgement and generate valuable pathophysiological insights by extracting a set of clinically inspired, interpretable kinematic features. Our findings have implications beyond dystonia, showcasing the utility of visual perceptive frameworks in enhancing clinical management and fostering integration with advanced neuroimaging and neurotechnological methods. This study opens doors for future translational research to explore the broader application of computer vision and deep learning techniques to derive kinematic signatures of movement disorders across species and experimental conditions, promising more precise and personalised assessments that can significantly improve therapeutic strategies and patient outcomes.</p>
