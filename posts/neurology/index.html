Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.\nTransferability of a European-derived Alzheimer Disease Genetic Risk Score across Multi-Ancestry Populations.\nAuthors: Nicolas, A.; Grenier-Boley, B.; Sherva, R.; Kim, Y.; Kikuchi, M.; de Rojas, i.; Dalmasso, C.; Zhou, X.; Le Guen, Y.; Arboleda-Bustos, C. E.; Camargos Bicalho, M.

J.; Pastor, P.; S\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297061\nWe built a genetic risk score (GRS) from the most complete landscape of the Alzheimer disease (AD) genetics. We extended its analysis in 16 European countries and observed a consistent association of this GRS with AD risk, age at onset and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker levels regardless of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. This GRS was also associated with AD risk (independently of APOE) with a decreasing order of magnitude in those with an European-American, North-African, East-Asian, Latin-American, African-American background respectively. No association of the GRS to AD was seen in sub-Saharan African and Indian populations. This GRS captures information specific to AD as its association decreases as the diagnosis broadens. In conclusion, a simple GRS captures shared genetic information specific to AD between multi-ancestry populations. However, more population diversity is needed to better understand the AD genetic complexity across populations.\nLongitudinal prevalence of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in the idiopathic Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort.\nAuthors: Beach, P. A.; McKay, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297107\nBackgroundReported orthostatic hypotension (OH) prevalence in Parkinson disease (PD) varies widely, with few studies evaluating specifically neurogenic-OH (nOH). The ratio of orthostatic heart rate (HR) to systolic blood pressure (SBP) change ({Delta}) is a valid screening method to stratify nOH/non-nOH but had minimal epidemiologic application. ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence of nOH and non-nOH in the PPMI using the {Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP ratio and examine associations between nOH and various motor and non-motor measures. MethodsLongitudinal orthostatic vitals and motor and non-motor measures were extracted (baseline-month 48). Patients were consensus criteria classified as OH+/-, with {Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP sub-classification to nOH ({Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP\u003c0.5) or non-nOH (ratio[\u0026ge;]0.5). Prevalence was determined across visits. Independent linear mixed models tested associations between nOH/non-nOH and clinical variables. ResultsOf N=907 PD with baseline orthostatic vitals, 3.9% and 1.8% exhibited nOH and non-nOH, respectively. Prevalence of nOH/non-nOH increased yearly (P=0.012, chi-square), though with modest magnitude (baseline: 5.6% [95% CI: 4.3-7.3%]; month 48: 8.6% [6.4-11.5%]). nOH patients were older than PD with no OH and nOH was associated with greater impairment of motor and independent functioning than non-nOH/OH-groups. Cognitive function and typical OH symptoms were worse in PD+OH, generally. ConclusionsnOH prevalence was greater than non-nOH in the PPMI early PD cohort, with modest prevalence increase over time. Our findings are consistent with prior studies of larges cohorts that evaluated nOH, specifically. Early PD with nOH were likelier to be older and suffer from greater motor and functional impairment, but OH presence was generally associated with more cognitive impairment.\nMultivariate Age-related analysis of variance in quantitative MRI maps: Widespread age-related differences revisited\nAuthors: Moallemian, S.; Bastin, C.; Callaghan, M. F.; Phillips, C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297253\nThis study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.\nSeparating representational and noise components of speech prosody perception after brain stroke\nAuthors: ADL ZARRABI, A.; Jeulin, M.; Bardet, P.; Commere, P.; Naccache, L.; Aucouturier, J.-J.; Ponsot, E.; Villain, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297140\nAfter a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation+noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.\nHorizon Sham Adaptor: Unlocking the Potential of Dual-Functionality of Single TMS Coil for Real and Sham Stimulations\nAuthors: Memarian Sorkhabi, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297143\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis paper introduces a new figure-of-eight TMS coil design capable of delivering both real and sham TMS stimulation using a single coil. The design, emitted clicking noise, and induced tactile sensation provide no discernible indication of whether it is in the real or sham state, making it suitable for double-blind studies. This coil family comprises the E-z Cool Coil and Air Film Coil (AFC) and is compatible with Magstim Horizon stimulators. This single-coil TMS setup enables the administration of either real or sham protocols without requiring coil replacement or physical repositioning. The transition between these states is achieved simply by replacing the adaptor between the coil connector and the TMS device.\nRurality Modifies the Association Between Symptoms and the Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nAuthors: Hart, A. A.; Swenson, A.; Narayanan, N.; Simmering, J. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23297024\nObjectiveWe utilized national claims-based data to identify the change in hazard of diagnosis of ALS following a possible ALS-related diagnosis (e.g., falls) and whether the change in hazard varies whether the patient lives in an urban or rural area. MethodsHealth insurance claims data from both the commercial insurance market and Medicare supplemental market were obtained from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Coordination of Benefits databases. Individuals with a diagnosis of ALS were identified and matched on age, sex, and enrollment period to individuals without ALS. For all individuals, inciting events such as falls, muscle related symptoms, or bulbar symptoms were also extracted. We then used fixed-effects regression to estimate the risk of being diagnosed with ALS following one of these events controlling for urban-rural status. Additionally, we utilized interaction terms to evaluate the effect of rurality on odds of diagnosis. Results19,126 individuals with ALS were included with 96,126 controls. Patients with ALS were more likely than matched controls to live in an urban area (87 vs 85%). Of those with ALS 84% had a symptom code preceding their diagnosis as compared to 51% in the general population. The association between having any symptoms and future diagnosis of ALS remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounders and an odds ratio of nearly 5. Odds ratios for the individual symptoms varied from 1.2 to over 10. In all models, living in an urban area was associated with increased odds of diagnosis with ALS while the effect of having a symptom was smaller among urban dwellers. Urban dwellers who are diagnosed with ALS are diagnosed at younger ages. ConclusionsEarly diagnosis of ALS is vital for connecting patients with research and treatment options. These results suggest symptoms appear in the administrative health record potentially years before the diagnosis of ALS. Additionally, rural patients are diagnosed at later ages with a greater dependence on major symptoms than urban patients. These results highlight potential improvements for surveillance and screening for ALS.\nStriatal dopamine tone is positively associated with body mass index in humans as determined by PET using dual dopamine type-2 receptor antagonist tracers\nAuthors: Darcey, V. L.; Guo, J.; Chi, M.; Chung, S. T.; Courville, A. B.; Gallagher, I.; Herscovitch, P.; Howard, R.; La Noire, M.; Milley, L.; Schick, A.; Stagliano, M.; Turner, S.; Urbanski, N.; Yang, S.; Yim, E.; Zhai, N.; Zhou, M. S.; Hall, K. D.\nScore: 48.4, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296169\nThe relationship between adiposity and dopamine type-2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the human brain has been repeatedly studied for \u003e20 years with highly discrepant results, likely due to variable methodologies and differing study populations. We conducted a controlled inpatient feeding study to measure D2BP in the striatum using positron emission tomography with both [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in pseudo-random order in 54 young adults with a wide range of body mass index (BMI 20-44 kg/m2). Within-subject D2BP measurements using the two tracers were moderately correlated (r=0.47, p\u003c0.001). D2BP was negatively correlated with BMI as measured by [11C]raclopride (r= -0.51; p\u003c0.0001) but not [18F]fallypride (r=-0.01; p=0.92) and these correlation coefficients were significantly different from each other (p\u003c0.001). Given that [18F]fallypride has greater binding affinity to dopamine type-2 receptors than [11C]raclopride, which is more easily displaced by endogenous dopamine, our results suggest that adiposity is positively associated with increased striatal dopamine tone.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We built a genetic risk score (GRS) from the most complete landscape of the Alzheimer disease (AD) genetics. We extended its analysis in 16 European countries and observed a consistent association of this GRS with AD risk, age at onset and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker levels regardless of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. This GRS was also associated with AD risk (independently of APOE) with a decreasing order of magnitude in those with an European-American, North-African, East-Asian, Latin-American, African-American background respectively. No association of the GRS to AD was seen in sub-Saharan African and Indian populations. This GRS captures information specific to AD as its association decreases as the diagnosis broadens. In conclusion, a simple GRS captures shared genetic information specific to AD between multi-ancestry populations. However, more population diversity is needed to better understand the AD genetic complexity across populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundReported orthostatic hypotension (OH) prevalence in Parkinson disease (PD) varies widely, with few studies evaluating specifically neurogenic-OH (nOH). The ratio of orthostatic heart rate (HR) to systolic blood pressure (SBP) change ({Delta}) is a valid screening method to stratify nOH/non-nOH but had minimal epidemiologic application.

ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence of nOH and non-nOH in the PPMI using the {Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP ratio and examine associations between nOH and various motor and non-motor measures.

MethodsLongitudinal orthostatic vitals and motor and non-motor measures were extracted (baseline-month 48). Patients were consensus criteria classified as OH&#43;/-, with {Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP sub-classification to nOH ({Delta}HR/{Delta}SBP&lt;0.5) or non-nOH (ratio[&amp;ge;]0.5). Prevalence was determined across visits. Independent linear mixed models tested associations between nOH/non-nOH and clinical variables.

ResultsOf N=907 PD with baseline orthostatic vitals, 3.9% and 1.8% exhibited nOH and non-nOH, respectively. Prevalence of nOH/non-nOH increased yearly (P=0.012, chi-square), though with modest magnitude (baseline: 5.6% [95% CI: 4.3-7.3%]; month 48: 8.6% [6.4-11.5%]). nOH patients were older than PD with no OH and nOH was associated with greater impairment of motor and independent functioning than non-nOH/OH-groups. Cognitive function and typical OH symptoms were worse in PD&#43;OH, generally.

ConclusionsnOH prevalence was greater than non-nOH in the PPMI early PD cohort, with modest prevalence increase over time. Our findings are consistent with prior studies of larges cohorts that evaluated nOH, specifically. Early PD with nOH were likelier to be older and suffer from greater motor and functional impairment, but OH presence was generally associated with more cognitive impairment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation&#43;noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis paper introduces a new figure-of-eight TMS coil design capable of delivering both real and sham TMS stimulation using a single coil. The design, emitted clicking noise, and induced tactile sensation provide no discernible indication of whether it is in the real or sham state, making it suitable for double-blind studies. This coil family comprises the E-z Cool Coil and Air Film Coil (AFC) and is compatible with Magstim Horizon stimulators. This single-coil TMS setup enables the administration of either real or sham protocols without requiring coil replacement or physical repositioning. The transition between these states is achieved simply by replacing the adaptor between the coil connector and the TMS device.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveWe utilized national claims-based data to identify the change in hazard of diagnosis of ALS following a possible ALS-related diagnosis (e.g., falls) and whether the change in hazard varies whether the patient lives in an urban or rural area.

MethodsHealth insurance claims data from both the commercial insurance market and Medicare supplemental market were obtained from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Coordination of Benefits databases. Individuals with a diagnosis of ALS were identified and matched on age, sex, and enrollment period to individuals without ALS. For all individuals, inciting events such as falls, muscle related symptoms, or bulbar symptoms were also extracted. We then used fixed-effects regression to estimate the risk of being diagnosed with ALS following one of these events controlling for urban-rural status. Additionally, we utilized interaction terms to evaluate the effect of rurality on odds of diagnosis.

Results19,126 individuals with ALS were included with 96,126 controls. Patients with ALS were more likely than matched controls to live in an urban area (87 vs 85%). Of those with ALS 84% had a symptom code preceding their diagnosis as compared to 51% in the general population. The association between having any symptoms and future diagnosis of ALS remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounders and an odds ratio of nearly 5. Odds ratios for the individual symptoms varied from 1.2 to over 10. In all models, living in an urban area was associated with increased odds of diagnosis with ALS while the effect of having a symptom was smaller among urban dwellers. Urban dwellers who are diagnosed with ALS are diagnosed at younger ages.

ConclusionsEarly diagnosis of ALS is vital for connecting patients with research and treatment options. These results suggest symptoms appear in the administrative health record potentially years before the diagnosis of ALS. Additionally, rural patients are diagnosed at later ages with a greater dependence on major symptoms than urban patients. These results highlight potential improvements for surveillance and screening for ALS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relationship between adiposity and dopamine type-2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the human brain has been repeatedly studied for &gt;20 years with highly discrepant results, likely due to variable methodologies and differing study populations. We conducted a controlled inpatient feeding study to measure D2BP in the striatum using positron emission tomography with both [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in pseudo-random order in 54 young adults with a wide range of body mass index (BMI 20-44 kg/m2). Within-subject D2BP measurements using the two tracers were moderately correlated (r=0.47, p&lt;0.001). D2BP was negatively correlated with BMI as measured by [11C]raclopride (r= -0.51; p&lt;0.0001) but not [18F]fallypride (r=-0.01; p=0.92) and these correlation coefficients were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.001). Given that [18F]fallypride has greater binding affinity to dopamine type-2 receptors than [11C]raclopride, which is more easily displaced by endogenous dopamine, our results suggest that adiposity is positively associated with increased striatal dopamine tone.</p>
