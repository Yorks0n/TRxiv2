R.\nScore: 70.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294253\nVitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination.1 Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline.2,3,4 However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.\nHow is sleep-disordered breathing linked with biomarkers of Alzheimer disease?\nAuthors: Akradi, M.; Farzane-Daghigh, T.; Ebneabbasi, A.; Bi, H.; Drzezga, A.; Mander, B. A.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294054\nSleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in Alzheimers disease (AD). We assessed whether and how SDB affects neuroimaging biomarkers of AD, including amyloid-beta plaque burden (A{beta}), regional uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose using positron emission tomography (rFDG-PET), grey matter volume (GMV), as well as cognitive scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. MethodsWe selected 757 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database based on cognitive status (AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitively unimpaired (CU)), and SDB condition (with/without SDB). To ensure the reliability of our findings and considering imbalanced sample size across groups, we used a stratified subsampling approach generating 10,000 subsamples (n=10/group). We then selected 512 subsamples with matched covariates. The effect size of the cognitive status-SDB interaction was computed for each biomarker and cognitive score. For reference, we computed 1000 null models by shuffling group labels randomly. The average value of effect sizes for each biomarker in each region was estimated through bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations for both the main and null models and compared with the null models distribution. Linear regression models were next implemented to identify associations between the effect size on A{beta}, rFDG, and GMV with the effect size on cognitive scores and CSF biomarkers across all subsamples. ResultsThe cognitive status-SDB interaction had a medium-sized effect on A{beta}, rFDG and GMV biomarkers in several brain areas. The effect sizes of the mentioned interactions on A{beta} plaque burden in the right precuneus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left occipital fusiform gyrus were associated with the effect sizes of the interactions on cognitive scores. Further, the interaction effect sizes on CSF A{beta}42 were related to the interaction effect sizes on A{beta} in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as rFDG in the left precuneus cortex and GMV in bilateral angular gyrus and right occipital fusiform gyrus. Effect sizes on CSF p-tau were also correlated with the effect sizes on A{beta} in the left lateral occipital cortex and GMV in the left middle temporal gyrus. ConclusionWe observed that SDB interacts with neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of AD. Specifically, SDB has a robust association with markers of A{beta} pathology in PET and CSF relative to rFDG and GMV in the AD group. The cognitive status-SDB interaction on A{beta} is associated with cognitive decline. This study further supports the hypothesis that SDB may precipitate AD pathology.\nSynaptic inhibitory dynamics drive benzodiazepine response in paediatric status epilepticus\nAuthors: Fedele, T.; Burman, R. J.; Steinberg, A.; Selmin, G.; Ramantani, G.; Rosch, R.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294456\nPaediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.\nClassifying the risk for myasthenic crisis using data-driven explainable machine learning with informative feature design and variance control - a pilot study\nAuthors: Bershan, S.; Meisel, A.; Mergenthaler, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.23294175\nImportanceMyasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression. ObjectiveTo test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC. DesignThis is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010. SettingSingle center. ParticipantsA cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023. ExposureClassification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient. ResultsThis study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data? FindingsIn this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features. MeaningThese findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision.\nLinking cortical lesions to metabolic changes in multiple sclerosis using 7T proton MR spectroscopy\nAuthors: Madsen, M. A. J.; Povazan, M.; Wiggermann, V.; Lundell, H.; Blinkenberg, M.; Christensen, J. R.; Sellebjerg, F.; Siebner, H. R.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294260\nImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex. DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T. SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020. ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2). ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI. Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel. ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean +/- standard deviation, 45.1 +/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 +/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 +/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 +/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 +/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 +/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups. ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels. Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis? Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume. Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.\nUncovering Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Corticothalamic Network during Seizures\nAuthors: Panchavati, S.; Daida, A.; Edmonds, B.; Miyakoshi, M.; Oana, S.; Ahn, S. S.; Arnold, C. D.; Salamon, N.; Sankar, R.; Fallah, A.; Speier, W.; Nariai, H.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294382\nObjectiveAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus (AN) and centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. This study aims to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci. MethodsWe analyzed ten patients (aged 2.7-28.1) with medication-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent stereotactic EEG evaluation with thalamic coverage. We examined both undirected and directed connectivity, incorporating coherence and spectral Granger causality analysis (GCA) between the diverse seizure foci and thalamic nuclei (AN and CM). ResultsIn our analysis of 36 seizures, coherence between seizure onset and thalamic nuclei increased across all frequencies, especially in slower bands (delta, theta, alpha). GCA showed increased information flow from seizure onset to the thalamus across all frequency bands, but outflows from the thalamus were mainly in slower frequencies, particularly delta. In the subgroup analysis based on various seizure foci, the delta coherence showed a more pronounced increase at CM than at AN during frontal lobe seizures. Conversely, in limbic seizures, the delta coherence increase was greater at AN compared to CM. InterpretationIt appears that the delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. Our results underscore the significance of comprehending the spatiotemporal dynamics of the corticothalamic network during seizures, and this knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies. Summary for Social MediaTwitter handles: @saarang_p; @BillSpeier What is the current knowledge on the topicAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. What question did this study addressThis study aimed to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci. What does this study add to our knowledgeThe delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. There are seizure-onset dependent spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network. How might this potentially impact on the practice of neurologyThis knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies.\nNeurostimulation in upper-limb amputees for suppression of phantom limb pain: changes in high-density EEG patterns\nAuthors: Kleeva, D.; Soghoyan, G.; Biktimirov, A.; Piliugin, N.; Matvienko, Y.; Sintsov, M.; Lebedev, M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.23294037\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.\nCOVID-19 Symptoms and Immunotherapy in People with Multiple Sclerosis: An Analysis of the COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative Dataset\nAuthors: Garcia-Dominguez, M. A.; Srichawla, B. S.; Kipkorir, V.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294509\nOBJECTIVES: To analyze the symptoms and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) on immunotherapy using data from the COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis (MS) Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset provided by PhysioNet. METHODS: The open-access COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset was obtained through credentialed access using PhysioNet. The variables analyzed included body mass index (BMI), symptoms of COVID-19, age, current use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT), efficacy of DMT, comorbidities, hospitalization status, and type of MS. A linear regression analysis was completed. Data analysis and visualization were completed using STATA v1.5, R-Studio v1.1.447, Python v3.8, and its associated libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. RESULTS: A total of 1141 participants were included in the analysis. 904 women and 237 men were diagnosed with MS. Among the pwMS included in the study; 208 (19.54%) had a suspected infection with COVID-19 and only 49 (5.25%) were confirmed. Any COVID-19 symptom was present in 360 individuals. The commonly reported DMT agents included dimethyl fumarate (12.71%) and fingolimod (10.17%). 101 in total (8.85%) reported not using any DMT. Factors associated with hospitalization and/or admission to the ICU included having any comorbidity (p = 0.01), neuromuscular disorder (p = 0.046), hypertension (p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (p \u003c 0.001), and immunodeficiency (p = 0.003). The type of MS, the duration of the disease, and high-efficacy DMT therapy did not have a statistically significant influence on hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of comorbidities, especially neuromuscular disorders, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and immunodeficiencies, as possible prognostic indicators for worse outcomes of COVID-19 in pwMS. On the contrary, the type of MS, the duration of the disease, and the efficacy of disease-modifying therapy did not significantly affect the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 in this cohort.\nAssociation between Dysphagia and Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety after Ischemic Stroke\nAuthors: Karisik, A.; STROKE-CARD Registry Study Group, ; Dejakum, B.; Moelgg, K.; Komarek, S.; Toell, T.; Mayer-Suess, L.; Pechlaner, R.; Kostner, S.; Sollereder, S.; Kiechl, S.

We aimed to investigate the potential relationship between swallowing impairment and symptoms of anxiety and depression after ischemic stroke. METHODS Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke participating in the prospective STROKE-CARD Registry study at the study center Innsbruck, Austria from 2020 to 2022 were assessed for presence of dysphagia on hospital admission (clinical swallowing assessment) as well as for persistence until hospital discharge and a 3-month follow-up (SINGER Independency Index). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were recorded using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS Of 648 patients (36.6% female), 19.3% had dysphagia at hospital admission which persisted in 14.8% (hospital discharge) and 6.8% (3-month follow-up). With the presence or duration of dysphagia (no dysphagia, dysphagia at baseline, discharge or at 3 months), score points (mean{+/-}SD) increased in the BDI (7.9{+/-}6.7, 12.5{+/-}8.7, 13.5{+/-}9.0, 16.5{+/-}10.2), HADS-D (4.4{+/-}3.7, 7.1{+/-}4.2, 7.7{+/-}4.4, 9.8{+/-}4.3) and HADS-A (4.4{+/-}3.5, 5.4{+/-}3.6, 6.0{+/-}3.6, 7.0{+/-}3.6). In linear regression analysis adjusting for age, sex and functional disability, BDI and HADS-D but not HADS-A scores were significantly higher in patients with dysphagia when compared to those without dysphagia at baseline or who recovered to discharge and follow-up. Moreover, patients with swallowing impairment were more likely to receive antidepressants, antipsychotics or benzodiazepines at discharge and 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Dysphagia after stroke is common and severely affects psychosocial functioning of individuals. Our results highlight swallowing impairment as an independent predictor of depressive symptoms after stroke.\nLong-read sequencing resolves a complex structural variant in PRKN Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Daida, K.; Funayama, M.; Billingsley, K. J.; Malik, L.; Miano-Burkhardt, A.; Leonard, H. L.; Makarious, M. B.; Iwaki, H.; Ding, J.; Gibbs, J. R.; Ishiguro, M.; Yoshino, H.; Ogaki, K.; Oyama, G.; Nishioka, K.; Nonaka, R.; Akamatsu, W.; Blauwendraat, C.; Hattori, N.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23293948\nBackgroundPRKN mutations are the most common cause of young onset and autosomal recessive Parkinsons disease (PD). PRKN is located in FRA6E which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. ObjectivesTo identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. MethodsWe investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of AMP-PD and UK-Biobank datasets. ResultsMultiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon 3 deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4,941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN isoforms. ConclusionsThis is the first report describing a large 7Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN. This study highlights the importance of using long-read whole genome sequencing for structural variant analysis in unresolved young-onset PD cases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Vitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination.1 Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline.2,3,4 However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in Alzheimers disease (AD). We assessed whether and how SDB affects neuroimaging biomarkers of AD, including amyloid-beta plaque burden (A{beta}), regional uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose using positron emission tomography (rFDG-PET), grey matter volume (GMV), as well as cognitive scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

MethodsWe selected 757 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database based on cognitive status (AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitively unimpaired (CU)), and SDB condition (with/without SDB). To ensure the reliability of our findings and considering imbalanced sample size across groups, we used a stratified subsampling approach generating 10,000 subsamples (n=10/group). We then selected 512 subsamples with matched covariates. The effect size of the cognitive status-SDB interaction was computed for each biomarker and cognitive score. For reference, we computed 1000 null models by shuffling group labels randomly. The average value of effect sizes for each biomarker in each region was estimated through bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations for both the main and null models and compared with the null models distribution. Linear regression models were next implemented to identify associations between the effect size on A{beta}, rFDG, and GMV with the effect size on cognitive scores and CSF biomarkers across all subsamples.

ResultsThe cognitive status-SDB interaction had a medium-sized effect on A{beta}, rFDG and GMV biomarkers in several brain areas. The effect sizes of the mentioned interactions on A{beta} plaque burden in the right precuneus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left occipital fusiform gyrus were associated with the effect sizes of the interactions on cognitive scores. Further, the interaction effect sizes on CSF A{beta}42 were related to the interaction effect sizes on A{beta} in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as rFDG in the left precuneus cortex and GMV in bilateral angular gyrus and right occipital fusiform gyrus. Effect sizes on CSF p-tau were also correlated with the effect sizes on A{beta} in the left lateral occipital cortex and GMV in the left middle temporal gyrus.

ConclusionWe observed that SDB interacts with neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of AD. Specifically, SDB has a robust association with markers of A{beta} pathology in PET and CSF relative to rFDG and GMV in the AD group. The cognitive status-SDB interaction on A{beta} is associated with cognitive decline. This study further supports the hypothesis that SDB may precipitate AD pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Paediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceMyasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression.

ObjectiveTo test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC.

DesignThis is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010.

SettingSingle center.

ParticipantsA cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023.

ExposureClassification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient.

ResultsThis study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data?

FindingsIn this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features.

MeaningThese findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex.

DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T.

SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020.

ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2).

ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI.

Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel.

ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean &#43;/- standard deviation, 45.1 &#43;/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 &#43;/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 &#43;/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 &#43;/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 &#43;/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 &#43;/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups.

ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels.

Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis?

Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume.

Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus (AN) and centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. This study aims to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci.

MethodsWe analyzed ten patients (aged 2.7-28.1) with medication-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent stereotactic EEG evaluation with thalamic coverage. We examined both undirected and directed connectivity, incorporating coherence and spectral Granger causality analysis (GCA) between the diverse seizure foci and thalamic nuclei (AN and CM).

ResultsIn our analysis of 36 seizures, coherence between seizure onset and thalamic nuclei increased across all frequencies, especially in slower bands (delta, theta, alpha). GCA showed increased information flow from seizure onset to the thalamus across all frequency bands, but outflows from the thalamus were mainly in slower frequencies, particularly delta. In the subgroup analysis based on various seizure foci, the delta coherence showed a more pronounced increase at CM than at AN during frontal lobe seizures. Conversely, in limbic seizures, the delta coherence increase was greater at AN compared to CM.

InterpretationIt appears that the delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. Our results underscore the significance of comprehending the spatiotemporal dynamics of the corticothalamic network during seizures, and this knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies.

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVES: To analyze the symptoms and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) on immunotherapy using data from the COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis (MS) Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset provided by PhysioNet. METHODS: The open-access COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset was obtained through credentialed access using PhysioNet. The variables analyzed included body mass index (BMI), symptoms of COVID-19, age, current use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT), efficacy of DMT, comorbidities, hospitalization status, and type of MS. A linear regression analysis was completed. Data analysis and visualization were completed using STATA v1.5, R-Studio v1.1.447, Python v3.8, and its associated libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. RESULTS: A total of 1141 participants were included in the analysis. 904 women and 237 men were diagnosed with MS. Among the pwMS included in the study; 208 (19.54%) had a suspected infection with COVID-19 and only 49 (5.25%) were confirmed. Any COVID-19 symptom was present in 360 individuals. The commonly reported DMT agents included dimethyl fumarate (12.71%) and fingolimod (10.17%). 101 in total (8.85%) reported not using any DMT. Factors associated with hospitalization and/or admission to the ICU included having any comorbidity (p = 0.01), neuromuscular disorder (p = 0.046), hypertension (p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (p &lt; 0.001), and immunodeficiency (p = 0.003). The type of MS, the duration of the disease, and high-efficacy DMT therapy did not have a statistically significant influence on hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of comorbidities, especially neuromuscular disorders, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and immunodeficiencies, as possible prognostic indicators for worse outcomes of COVID-19 in pwMS. On the contrary, the type of MS, the duration of the disease, and the efficacy of disease-modifying therapy did not significantly affect the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 in this cohort.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND Dysphagia after stroke is associated not only with poor outcome and higher mortality, but also with reduced quality of life and social isolation. We aimed to investigate the potential relationship between swallowing impairment and symptoms of anxiety and depression after ischemic stroke. METHODS Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke participating in the prospective STROKE-CARD Registry study at the study center Innsbruck, Austria from 2020 to 2022 were assessed for presence of dysphagia on hospital admission (clinical swallowing assessment) as well as for persistence until hospital discharge and a 3-month follow-up (SINGER Independency Index). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were recorded using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS Of 648 patients (36.6% female), 19.3% had dysphagia at hospital admission which persisted in 14.8% (hospital discharge) and 6.8% (3-month follow-up). With the presence or duration of dysphagia (no dysphagia, dysphagia at baseline, discharge or at 3 months), score points (mean{&#43;/-}SD) increased in the BDI (7.9{&#43;/-}6.7, 12.5{&#43;/-}8.7, 13.5{&#43;/-}9.0, 16.5{&#43;/-}10.2), HADS-D (4.4{&#43;/-}3.7, 7.1{&#43;/-}4.2, 7.7{&#43;/-}4.4, 9.8{&#43;/-}4.3) and HADS-A (4.4{&#43;/-}3.5, 5.4{&#43;/-}3.6, 6.0{&#43;/-}3.6, 7.0{&#43;/-}3.6). In linear regression analysis adjusting for age, sex and functional disability, BDI and HADS-D but not HADS-A scores were significantly higher in patients with dysphagia when compared to those without dysphagia at baseline or who recovered to discharge and follow-up. Moreover, patients with swallowing impairment were more likely to receive antidepressants, antipsychotics or benzodiazepines at discharge and 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Dysphagia after stroke is common and severely affects psychosocial functioning of individuals. Our results highlight swallowing impairment as an independent predictor of depressive symptoms after stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPRKN mutations are the most common cause of young onset and autosomal recessive Parkinsons disease (PD). PRKN is located in FRA6E which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants.

ObjectivesTo identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing.

MethodsWe investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of AMP-PD and UK-Biobank datasets.

ResultsMultiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon 3 deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4,941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN isoforms.

ConclusionsThis is the first report describing a large 7Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN. This study highlights the importance of using long-read whole genome sequencing for structural variant analysis in unresolved young-onset PD cases.</p>
