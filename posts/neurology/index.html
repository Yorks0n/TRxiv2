R.; Wiseman, K. N.; Sanchez-Castillo, M.; Billings, S.; Jepsen, W.; Huentelman, M.; Narayanan, V.\nScore: 522.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296768\nWe sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.\nPathways linking pulse pressure to dementia in adults with Down syndrome\nAuthors: Rizvi, B.; Lao, P. J.; Sathishkumar, M.; Taylor, L.; Queder, N.; McMillan, L.; Edwards, N.; Keator, D. B.; Doran, E.; Hom, C.; Nguyen, D.; Rosas, H. D.; Lai, F.; Schupf, N.; Guiterrez, J.; Silverman, W.; Lott, I. T.; Mapstone, M.; Wilcock, D. M.; Head, E.; Yassa, M. A.; Brickman, A. M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297625\nIndividuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{+/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.\nMultivariate Age-related analysis of variance in quantitative MRI maps: Widespread age-related differences revisited\nAuthors: Moallemian, S.; Bastin, C.; Callaghan, M. F.; Phillips, C.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297253\nThis study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.\nGGC expansion in ZFHX3 causes SCA4 and impairs autophagy\nAuthors: Figueroa, K. P.; Gross, C.; Atienza, E. B.; Paul, S.; Gandelman, M.; Haack, T. B.; Kakar, N.; Sturm, M.; Casadei, N.; Admard, J.; Park, J.; Zühlke, C.; Hellenbroich, Y.; Pozojevic, J.; Balachandran, S.; Händler, K.; Zittel, S.; Timmann, D.; Erdlenbruch, F.; Herrmann, L.; Feindt, T.; Zenker, M.; Dufke, C.; Hübener-Schmid, J.; Scoles, D. R.; Koeppen, A.; Ossowski, S.; Spielmann, M.; Riess, O.; Pulst, S. M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297560\nDespite linkage to 16q in 1996, the mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4), a late-onset sensory and cerebellar ataxia, escaped detection for 25 years. Using long-read PacBio-HiFi and ONT-Nanopre sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified expansion of a GGC DNA repeat in a \u003e85% GC-rich region in exon 10 of the ZFHX3 gene coding for poly-glycine (polyG). In a total of 15 nuclear families from Utah and 9 from Europe, the repeat was expanded to \u003e40 repeats in SCA4 patients accompanied by significant phenotypic variation independent of repeat size compared to the most common normal repeat size of 21 repeats. The RE event likely occurred in a frequent Swedish haplotype shared by cases from Utah and Germany. Six characteristic ultra-rare SNVs in the vicinity of the RE in cases from Utah and Lubeck (Germany) indicate a common founder event for some of the patients. In fibroblast and iPS cells, the GGC expansion leads to increased ZFHX3 protein levels, polyG aggregates, and abnormal autophagy, which normalized with ZFHX3 siRNA. Increasing autophagic flux may provide a therapeutic avenue for this novel polyG disease.\nGenome-wide association study identifies APOE and ZMIZ1 variants as mitophagy modifiers in Lewy body disease\nAuthors: Hou, X.; Heckman, M. G.; Fiesel, F. C.; Koga, S.; Soto-Beasley, A. I.; Watzlawik, J. O.; Zhao, J.; Valentino, R. R.; Johnson, P. W.; White, L. J.; Quicksall, Z. S.; Reddy, J. S.; Bras, J.; Guerreiro, R.; Zhao, N.; Bu, G.; Dickson, D. W.; Ross, O. A.; Springer, W.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297100\nThe PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; {beta}: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p=8.67x10-25) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; {beta}: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p=1.42x10-8). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4-carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain (ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimers disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.\nCalcitriol treatment is safe and increases frataxin levels in Friedreich Ataxia patients.\nAuthors: Alemany-Perna, B.; Tamarit, J.; Lopez Dominguez, D.; Quiroga-Varela, A.; Merchan-Ruiz, M.; Ramio Torrenta, L.; Genis Batlle, D.; Ros, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297713\nABSTRACT. Background: Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), improves the phenotype and increases frataxin levels in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA). Methods: Based on these results, we started a pilot clinical trial in which a dose of 0.25mcg/24h was administered to 15 FRDA patients for a year. Evaluations of neurological function changes (SARA scale, 9-HPT, 8-MWT, PATA test) and quality of life (Barthel Scale and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire) were performed. Frataxin amounts were measured in isolated platelets obtained from these FRDA patients, from heterozygous FRDA carriers (relatives of the FA patients) and from non-heterozygous sex and age matched controls. Results: Although the patients did not experience any observable neurological improvement, there was a statistically significant increase in frataxin levels from initial values, 5,6 pg/ug, to 7,0 pg/ug after 12 months. Differences in frataxin levels referred to total protein amounts were observed amongst sex and age matched controls (18.11 pg/ug), relative controls (10.07 pg/ug), and FRDA patients (5.71 pg/ug). The treatment was well tolerated by most patients, and only some of them experienced minor adverse effects at the beginning of the trial. Conclusion: Calcitriol dosage used (0.25mcg/24h) is safe for FRDA patients and it increases frataxin levels. We cannot rule out that higher doses administered longer could yield neurological benefits.\nFTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes\nAuthors: Pasquini, L.; Pereira, F.; Seddighi, S.; Zeng, Y.; Ilan-Gala, I.; Vatsavayai, S.; Friedberg, A.; Lee, A.; Brown, J.; Spina, S.; Grinberg, L.; Sirkis, D.; Bonham, L.; Yokoyama, J.; Boxer, A.; Kramer, J.; Rosen, H.; Humphrey, J.; Gitler, A.; Miller, B.; Pollard, K.; Ward, M.; Seeley, W. W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297687\nIn frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.\nGenetic Analysis and Natural History of Parkinson's Disease Due to the LRRK2 G2019S Variant\nAuthors: Kmiecik, M. J.; Micheletti, S.; Coker, D.; Heilbron, K.; Shi, J.; Stagaman, K.; Filshtein Sonmez, T.; Fontanillas, P.; Shringarpure, S. S.; Schloetter, M.; Rowbotham, H. M.; Cannon, P.; Shelton, J. F.; Hinds, D. A.; Tung, J. Y.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Holmes, M. V.; Aslibekyan, S.; Norcliffe-Kaufmann, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297636\nThe LRRK2 G2019S variant is the most common cause of monogenic Parkinsons Disease (PD); however, questions remain regarding the penetrance, clinical phenotype, and natural history of carriers. We performed a 3.5 year prospective longitudinal online study in a large number of 1,286 genotyped LRRK2 G2019S carriers and 109,154 controls, with and without Parkinsons disease (PD) recruited from the 23andMe Research Cohort. We collected self-reported motor and non-motor symptoms every six months, as well as demographics, family histories, and environmental risk factors. Incident cases of PD (phenoconverters) were identified at follow-up. We determined lifetime risk of PD using accelerated failure time modeling and explored the impact of polygenic risk on penetrance. We also computed the genetic ancestry of all LRRK2 G2019S carriers in the 23andMe database and identified regions of the world where carrier frequencies are highest. We observed that despite a one year longer disease duration (p=0.016), LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD had similar burden of motor symptoms, yet significantly fewer non-motor symptoms including cognitive difficulties, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and hyposmia (all p-values\u003c0.0002). The cumulative incidence of PD in G2019S carriers by age 60 was 8.66%. G2019S carriers had a 10-fold risk of developing PD versus non-carriers. This rose to a 27-fold risk in G2019S carriers with a PD polygenic risk score in the top 25% versus non-carriers in the bottom 25%. In addition to identifying ancient founding events in people of North African and Ashkenazi descent, our genetic ancestry analyses infer that the G2019S variant was later introduced to Spanish colonial territories in the Americas. Our results suggest LRRK2 G2019S PD appears to be a slowly progressive predominantly motor subtype of PD with a lower prevalence of hyposmia, RBD, and cognitive impairment. This suggests that the current prodromal criteria, which are based on idiopathic PD, may lack sensitivity to detect the early phases of LRRK2 PD in G2019S carriers. We show that polygenic burden may contribute to the development of PD in the LRRK2 G2019S carrier population. Collectively, the results should help support screening programs and candidate enrichment strategies for upcoming trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in early-stage disease.\nElectroencephalographic insights into variant function and clinical outcomes in SCN2A encephalopathy\nAuthors: Fogerson, M.; Tsitsiklis, M.; Brimble, E.; Brunger, T.; Arslan, A.

L.; Lal, D.; Pathmanathan, J.; Westover, B.; Fitter, N.; Donoghue, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23296360\nNeither phenotype nor genotype reliably predicts clinical disease severity or neurodevelopmental outcomes in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this study we examined the electroencephalographic (EEG) features of children with SCN2A variants to quantify the range of EEG abnormalities and link EEG biomarkers to developmental outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed data from a cohort of 28 children with SCN2A variants and employed a genetics-based consensus framework to infer the functional characterization of each subjects SCN2A variant. Eleven subjects were predicted to have a gain-of-function variant, and 17 subjects a loss-of-function variant. Overall, variant classifications matched subject phenotypes. 493 EEG recordings from the 28 subjects were analyzed (ages 1 day to 16 years). In addition to the SCN2A recordings, normative data from 1230 children without an epilepsy diagnosis or epileptiform features based on neurologists review was analyzed (1704 EEG recordings, ages 0 days to 16 years). We detected interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the SCN2A recordings using Beacons automated IED detection algorithm. We characterized background spectral features by computing relative power in four frequency bands (delta=1-4Hz, theta=4-8Hz, alpha=8-13Hz, beta=13-30Hz) in recordings from both the SCN2A and control cohorts. Additionally, we determined whether each SCN2A recording was associated with a gross motor developmental delay based on reported attainment of gross motor milestones. We then used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate the effect of EEG biomarkers on developmental delay. We characterized EEG abnormalities in the background spectral features of the SCN2A cohort compared to the controls and identified differences in EEG signatures between the subjects with gain- and loss-of-function variants. Additionally, we showed that background spectral features are correlated with motor developmental outcome when measured relative to age-matched neurotypical children. Furthermore, we showed that interictal epileptiform activity is correlated with delayed motor development in subjects with gain-of-function variants. Taken together, these findings suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to identify neurological abnormalities that correlate both with SCN2A variants and measures of development. We demonstrate the potential value of EEG as a disease biomarker, and we highlight the potential of such biomarkers to both guide future invasive genetic therapies and to be used as diagnostic tools.\nSeparating representational and noise components of speech prosody perception after brain stroke\nAuthors: ADL ZARRABI, A.; Jeulin, M.; Bardet, P.; Commere, P.; Naccache, L.; Aucouturier, J.-J.; Ponsot, E.; Villain, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297140\nAfter a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation+noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{&#43;/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite linkage to 16q in 1996, the mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4), a late-onset sensory and cerebellar ataxia, escaped detection for 25 years. Using long-read PacBio-HiFi and ONT-Nanopre sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified expansion of a GGC DNA repeat in a &gt;85% GC-rich region in exon 10 of the ZFHX3 gene coding for poly-glycine (polyG). In a total of 15 nuclear families from Utah and 9 from Europe, the repeat was expanded to &gt;40 repeats in SCA4 patients accompanied by significant phenotypic variation independent of repeat size compared to the most common normal repeat size of 21 repeats. The RE event likely occurred in a frequent Swedish haplotype shared by cases from Utah and Germany. Six characteristic ultra-rare SNVs in the vicinity of the RE in cases from Utah and Lubeck (Germany) indicate a common founder event for some of the patients. In fibroblast and iPS cells, the GGC expansion leads to increased ZFHX3 protein levels, polyG aggregates, and abnormal autophagy, which normalized with ZFHX3 siRNA. Increasing autophagic flux may provide a therapeutic avenue for this novel polyG disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; {beta}: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p=8.67x10-25) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; {beta}: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p=1.42x10-8). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4-carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain (ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimers disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT. Background: Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), improves the phenotype and increases frataxin levels in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA). Methods: Based on these results, we started a pilot clinical trial in which a dose of 0.25mcg/24h was administered to 15 FRDA patients for a year. Evaluations of neurological function changes (SARA scale, 9-HPT, 8-MWT, PATA test) and quality of life (Barthel Scale and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire) were performed. Frataxin amounts were measured in isolated platelets obtained from these FRDA patients, from heterozygous FRDA carriers (relatives of the FA patients) and from non-heterozygous sex and age matched controls. Results: Although the patients did not experience any observable neurological improvement, there was a statistically significant increase in frataxin levels from initial values, 5,6 pg/ug, to 7,0 pg/ug after 12 months. Differences in frataxin levels referred to total protein amounts were observed amongst sex and age matched controls (18.11 pg/ug), relative controls (10.07 pg/ug), and FRDA patients (5.71 pg/ug). The treatment was well tolerated by most patients, and only some of them experienced minor adverse effects at the beginning of the trial. Conclusion: Calcitriol dosage used (0.25mcg/24h) is safe for FRDA patients and it increases frataxin levels. We cannot rule out that higher doses administered longer could yield neurological benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The LRRK2 G2019S variant is the most common cause of monogenic Parkinsons Disease (PD); however, questions remain regarding the penetrance, clinical phenotype, and natural history of carriers.

We performed a 3.5 year prospective longitudinal online study in a large number of 1,286 genotyped LRRK2 G2019S carriers and 109,154 controls, with and without Parkinsons disease (PD) recruited from the 23andMe Research Cohort. We collected self-reported motor and non-motor symptoms every six months, as well as demographics, family histories, and environmental risk factors. Incident cases of PD (phenoconverters) were identified at follow-up. We determined lifetime risk of PD using accelerated failure time modeling and explored the impact of polygenic risk on penetrance. We also computed the genetic ancestry of all LRRK2 G2019S carriers in the 23andMe database and identified regions of the world where carrier frequencies are highest.

We observed that despite a one year longer disease duration (p=0.016), LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD had similar burden of motor symptoms, yet significantly fewer non-motor symptoms including cognitive difficulties, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and hyposmia (all p-values&lt;0.0002). The cumulative incidence of PD in G2019S carriers by age 60 was 8.66%. G2019S carriers had a 10-fold risk of developing PD versus non-carriers. This rose to a 27-fold risk in G2019S carriers with a PD polygenic risk score in the top 25% versus non-carriers in the bottom 25%. In addition to identifying ancient founding events in people of North African and Ashkenazi descent, our genetic ancestry analyses infer that the G2019S variant was later introduced to Spanish colonial territories in the Americas.

Our results suggest LRRK2 G2019S PD appears to be a slowly progressive predominantly motor subtype of PD with a lower prevalence of hyposmia, RBD, and cognitive impairment. This suggests that the current prodromal criteria, which are based on idiopathic PD, may lack sensitivity to detect the early phases of LRRK2 PD in G2019S carriers. We show that polygenic burden may contribute to the development of PD in the LRRK2 G2019S carrier population. Collectively, the results should help support screening programs and candidate enrichment strategies for upcoming trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in early-stage disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neither phenotype nor genotype reliably predicts clinical disease severity or neurodevelopmental outcomes in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this study we examined the electroencephalographic (EEG) features of children with SCN2A variants to quantify the range of EEG abnormalities and link EEG biomarkers to developmental outcomes.

We retrospectively analyzed data from a cohort of 28 children with SCN2A variants and employed a genetics-based consensus framework to infer the functional characterization of each subjects SCN2A variant. Eleven subjects were predicted to have a gain-of-function variant, and 17 subjects a loss-of-function variant. Overall, variant classifications matched subject phenotypes. 493 EEG recordings from the 28 subjects were analyzed (ages 1 day to 16 years). In addition to the SCN2A recordings, normative data from 1230 children without an epilepsy diagnosis or epileptiform features based on neurologists review was analyzed (1704 EEG recordings, ages 0 days to 16 years). We detected interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the SCN2A recordings using Beacons automated IED detection algorithm. We characterized background spectral features by computing relative power in four frequency bands (delta=1-4Hz, theta=4-8Hz, alpha=8-13Hz, beta=13-30Hz) in recordings from both the SCN2A and control cohorts. Additionally, we determined whether each SCN2A recording was associated with a gross motor developmental delay based on reported attainment of gross motor milestones. We then used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate the effect of EEG biomarkers on developmental delay.

We characterized EEG abnormalities in the background spectral features of the SCN2A cohort compared to the controls and identified differences in EEG signatures between the subjects with gain- and loss-of-function variants. Additionally, we showed that background spectral features are correlated with motor developmental outcome when measured relative to age-matched neurotypical children. Furthermore, we showed that interictal epileptiform activity is correlated with delayed motor development in subjects with gain-of-function variants.

Taken together, these findings suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to identify neurological abnormalities that correlate both with SCN2A variants and measures of development. We demonstrate the potential value of EEG as a disease biomarker, and we highlight the potential of such biomarkers to both guide future invasive genetic therapies and to be used as diagnostic tools.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation&#43;noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.</p>
