D.\nScore: 28.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301332\nBackgroundIn Lewis Carrolls 1865 novel \"Alices Adventures in Wonderland\", the protagonist experiences distortions in the size of her body and those of others. This fiction becomes reality in neurological patients with Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS). Brain lesions causing AIWS may offer unique insights into the syndromes elusive neuroanatomy. MethodsA systematic literature search identified 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS. Lesion locations were mapped onto a brain atlas and functional connectivity between each lesion location and other brain regions was estimated using resting-state fMRI data from 1000 healthy subjects. Connections common to AIWS lesions were identified and compared to connections from 1073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alignment between this lesion-derived AIWS network and neuroimaging findings from patients with AIWS due to other etiologies was assessed. ResultsAlthough AIWS lesions occurred in many different brain locations, these lesions fell within a specific, functionally connected brain network. This network was defined by connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, a brain region selectively activated by viewing body parts, and the inferior parietal cortex, a brain region involved in processing of size and scale. This connectivity pattern was specific to AIWS when compared to lesions causing other neuropsychiatric disorders and aligned with neuroimaging findings in patients with AIWS from other etiologies. ConclusionLesions causing AIWS fall within a specific brain network defined by connectivity to two distinct brain regions, one region involved in body perception and another in processing of size and scale.\nProteomic Changes in the Human Cerebrovasculature in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathies Linked to Peripheral Biomarkers in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid\nAuthors: Wojtas, A. M.; Dammer, E. B.; Guo, Q.; Ping, L.; Shantaraman, A.; Duong, D. M.; Yin, L.; Fox, E. J.; Seifar, F.; Lee, E. B.; Johnson, E. C. B.; Lah, J. J.; Levey, A. I.; Levites, Y.; Rangaraju, S.; Golde, T. E.; Seyfried, N. T.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301099\nDysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.\nVAL-1221 FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH LAFORA DISEASE: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A SINGLE-ARM, OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL\nAuthors: Muccioli, L.; Vignatelli, L.; Tappata, M.; Mazzone, S.; Zenesini, C.; DEFEAT-LD study group, ; Armstrong, D.; Michelucci, R.; Bisulli, F.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24302141\nIntroductionLafora Disease (LD) is an ultrarare fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy, causing drug-resistant epilepsy, myoclonus, and psychomotor deterioration. LD is caused by mutations in EPM2A or NHLRC1, which lead to the accumulation of polyglucosans in the brain and neurodegeneration. There are no approved treatments for LD. VAL-1221 is a fusion protein comprised of the Fab portion of a cell-penetrating antibody and recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase, and has demonstrated an ability to clear polyglucosans. We hypothesize that intravenous infusion of VAL-1221 might be able to degrade cerebral polyglucosans and stabilize or improve disease outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of VAL-1221 in patients with LD. Methods and analysisThe study is a phase 2, single-arm, open-label, baseline-controlled clinical trial which will be conducted in a single investigational study center in Italy, namely the sponsor \"IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna - Azienda USL di Bologna\". The study will enroll 6 genetically-confirmed patients with mid- to late stage LD. The global duration of the study for each participant will be 18 months, including screening period, open-label treatment (12 months), and follow-up period. VAL-1221 20 mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion every week for 3 weeks, then every other week. Patients will undergo full clinical assessments at baseline, at an intermediate and at the end-of-treatment visit. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety. The exploratory efficacy endpoints will be related to epilepsy, neuropsychological and motor functions, global assessment and disease burden, in addition to biomarkers. Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive. Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (number 232-2023-FARM-AUSLBO-23020, 22-Mar-2023). The results of this study will be disseminated by the investigators through presentations at international scientific conferences and reported in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.\nAssociation between lifestyle at different life periods and brain integrity in older adults\nAuthors: Turpin, A.-L.; Felisatti, F.; Mezenge, F.; Landeau, B.; Vivien, D.; de la Sayette, V.; Chetelat, G.; Gonneaud, J.; Medit-Ageing Research Group, Score: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302049\nImportanceLifestyle factors have been associated with dementia risk and neuroimaging markers of ageing and Alzheimers Disease (AD), but the period at which they have the greatest influence remains unclear. ObjectiveTo determine the relative influence of lifestyle at different life periods on older adults brain health. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBaseline data from the Age-Well trial were used in this study. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 65 years and older were recruited in the general population between November 2016 to March 2018 in Caen, France. Analysis took place between June 2022 and September 2023. Exposure(s)The Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) was used to assess lifestyle during young adulthood (3-30y), midlife (30-65y) and late-life (\u003e65y). For each life period, LEQ score is divided into specific and non-specific subscores. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Multiple regressions were conducted including lifestyle at the three life periods (in the same model) to predict gray matter volume (GMv; from structural MRI), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), perfusion (Florbetapir-PET, early-acquisition) and amyloid burden (Florbetapir-PET, late-acquisition), both in AD-sensitive regions and voxel-wise, controlling for age and sex. Then, comparisons of correlations between lifestyle at each life period, as well as between specific versus non-specific activities, and neuroimaging outcomes were performed. ResultsOf the 135 older adults (mean age=69.3{+/-}3.79), 61.5% were women. No significant association was found between LEQ scores and AD-sensitive regions. While LEQ-young was not associated with neuroimaging, LEQ-midlife was more strongly associated with GMv, including in the anterior cingulate cortex, and with amyloid burden in the precuneus compared to the other periods. LEQ-late showed stronger associations with perfusion and glucose metabolism than LEQ-young and LEQ-midlife in medial frontal regions. Lower amyloid burden was more strongly correlated with LEQ-midlife specific than non-specific activities (z=-2.0977, p\u003c.05, [95% CI, -0.3985 - -0.0102]) while perfusion was more strongly correlated with LEQ-late non-specific than specific scores (z=2.4369, p\u003c.01, [95% CI, 0.0.415-0.4165]). Conclusions and RelevanceLifestyle at different life periods might have complementary benefits on structural/molecular versus functional markers of brain health in late-life. Interestingly, these associations were found in regions related to reserve/resilience and aging.

M.; Mascarenhas, R.; Merrikh, D.; Khanbabaei, M.; Maroilley, T.; Kaur, N.; Liu, Y.; Soule, T.; Manalo, M. K.; Tamura, G.; Jacobs, J.; Hader, W.; Pfeffer, G.; Tarailo-Graovac, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301006\nBackgroundRecent studies have identified brain somatic variants as a cause of focal epilepsy. These studies relied on resected tissue from epilepsy surgery which is not available in most patients. The use of trace tissue adherent to depth electrodes used for stereo electroencephalography (stereo EEG) has been proposed as an alternative but is hampered by the low cell quality and contamination by non-brain cells. Here, we use our improved depth electrode harvesting technique that purifies neuronal nuclei to achieve molecular diagnosis in a patient with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). MethodsDepth electrode tips were collected, pooled by brain region and seizure onset zone, nuclei isolated and sorted using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS). Somatic DNA was amplified from neuronal and astrocyte nuclei using primary template amplification followed by exome sequencing of neuronal DNA from the affected pool, unaffected pool, and saliva. The identified variant was validated using droplet digital PCR. ResultsAn adolescent male with drug-resistant genetic-structural epilepsy due to left anterior insula FCD had daily focal aware seizures. Stereo EEG confirmed seizure onset in the left anterior insula. The two anterior insula electrodes were combined as the affected pool and three frontal electrodes as the unaffected pool. FANS isolated 140 neuronal nuclei from the affected and 245 neuronal nuclei from the unaffected pool. A novel somatic missense MTOR variant (p.Leu489Met, CADD score 23.7) was identified in the affected neuronal sample. Droplet digital PCR confirmed a mosaic gradient (VAF 0.78% in affected neuronal sample, variant was absent in all other samples). ConclusionsOur finding confirms that harvesting neuronal DNA from depth electrodes followed by molecular analysis to identify brain somatic variants is feasible. Our novel method represents a significant improvement compared to the previous method by focusing the analysis on high quality cells of the cell type of interest.\nSodium Valproate Modulates Cortical Morphology in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy\nAuthors: Crespo Pimentel, B.; Kuchukhidze, G.; Xiao, F.; Caciagli, L.; Hoefler, J.; Rainer, L.; Kronbichler, M.; Vollmar, C.; Duncan, J. S.; Trinka, E.; Koepp, M.; Wandschneider, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301048\nImportanceIdiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes in are associated with cortical thinning of the premotor areas. Whether this represents an underlying disease signature, a consequence of seizure activity or is related to anti-seizure medication is unknown. ObjectiveTo investigate valproate-related effects on cortical morphology in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), one of the most common IGE syndromes. DesignRetrospective neuroimaging case-control study. SettingRecruitment took place in epilepsy clinics in two European epilepsy referral centers. ParticipantsWe matched individuals with JME on valproate (n=36) to a group of healthy controls (n=36), as well as individuals with JME not on valproate (n=36) and a group of people with temporal lobe epilepsy (n=19) on valproate using propensity scores for age, sex, occurrence of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and drug refractoriness. Main outcomes and MeasuresAll participants underwent structural T1-weighted brain imaging and MRI-derived vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness were calculated. Results were reported in effect-sizes using cohens d. ResultsCompared to healthy controls, individuals with JME on valproate demonstrated cortical thinning bilaterally in the precentral gyri (left: d = -1.0, p \u003c.001; right: d = -1.0, p \u003c.001). This effect was localized to the left precentral gyrus when comparing JME on VPA with individuals with JME not on valproate (d = -0.89; p\u003c.01) or with individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy on valproate (d = -0.18, p \u003c.001). No significant differences in cortical thickness were detected between individuals with JME not on valproate and healthy controls. Cortical thinning in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and superior frontal was more marked with increasing valproate dose (left: t = -6,65, p \u003c.0001; right: t = -5,20, p \u003c.0001). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cross-sectional study of 91 patients with epilepsy, valproate treatment was associated with JME-specific and dose-dependent cortical thinning of the precentral gyri. Our findings suggest a valproate-induced reorganization of disease-specific areas in JME that may not only help explain the high efficacy of this medication in IGEs but also potentially account for previously described changes of cortical thickness in this disease group.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn Lewis Carrolls 1865 novel &#34;Alices Adventures in Wonderland&#34;, the protagonist experiences distortions in the size of her body and those of others. This fiction becomes reality in neurological patients with Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS). Brain lesions causing AIWS may offer unique insights into the syndromes elusive neuroanatomy.

MethodsA systematic literature search identified 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS. Lesion locations were mapped onto a brain atlas and functional connectivity between each lesion location and other brain regions was estimated using resting-state fMRI data from 1000 healthy subjects. Connections common to AIWS lesions were identified and compared to connections from 1073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alignment between this lesion-derived AIWS network and neuroimaging findings from patients with AIWS due to other etiologies was assessed.

ResultsAlthough AIWS lesions occurred in many different brain locations, these lesions fell within a specific, functionally connected brain network. This network was defined by connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, a brain region selectively activated by viewing body parts, and the inferior parietal cortex, a brain region involved in processing of size and scale. This connectivity pattern was specific to AIWS when compared to lesions causing other neuropsychiatric disorders and aligned with neuroimaging findings in patients with AIWS from other etiologies.

ConclusionLesions causing AIWS fall within a specific brain network defined by connectivity to two distinct brain regions, one region involved in body perception and another in processing of size and scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionLafora Disease (LD) is an ultrarare fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy, causing drug-resistant epilepsy, myoclonus, and psychomotor deterioration. LD is caused by mutations in EPM2A or NHLRC1, which lead to the accumulation of polyglucosans in the brain and neurodegeneration. There are no approved treatments for LD. VAL-1221 is a fusion protein comprised of the Fab portion of a cell-penetrating antibody and recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase, and has demonstrated an ability to clear polyglucosans. We hypothesize that intravenous infusion of VAL-1221 might be able to degrade cerebral polyglucosans and stabilize or improve disease outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of VAL-1221 in patients with LD.

Methods and analysisThe study is a phase 2, single-arm, open-label, baseline-controlled clinical trial which will be conducted in a single investigational study center in Italy, namely the sponsor &#34;IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna - Azienda USL di Bologna&#34;. The study will enroll 6 genetically-confirmed patients with mid- to late stage LD. The global duration of the study for each participant will be 18 months, including screening period, open-label treatment (12 months), and follow-up period. VAL-1221 20 mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion every week for 3 weeks, then every other week. Patients will undergo full clinical assessments at baseline, at an intermediate and at the end-of-treatment visit. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety. The exploratory efficacy endpoints will be related to epilepsy, neuropsychological and motor functions, global assessment and disease burden, in addition to biomarkers. Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.

Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (number 232-2023-FARM-AUSLBO-23020, 22-Mar-2023). The results of this study will be disseminated by the investigators through presentations at international scientific conferences and reported in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

        <p class="abstract">Cerebrovascular diseases are the second most common cause of death worldwide and one of the major causes of disability burden. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLifestyle factors have been associated with dementia risk and neuroimaging markers of ageing and Alzheimers Disease (AD), but the period at which they have the greatest influence remains unclear.

ObjectiveTo determine the relative influence of lifestyle at different life periods on older adults brain health.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBaseline data from the Age-Well trial were used in this study. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 65 years and older were recruited in the general population between November 2016 to March 2018 in Caen, France. Analysis took place between June 2022 and September 2023.

Exposure(s)The Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) was used to assess lifestyle during young adulthood (3-30y), midlife (30-65y) and late-life (&gt;65y). For each life period, LEQ score is divided into specific and non-specific subscores.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Multiple regressions were conducted including lifestyle at the three life periods (in the same model) to predict gray matter volume (GMv; from structural MRI), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), perfusion (Florbetapir-PET, early-acquisition) and amyloid burden (Florbetapir-PET, late-acquisition), both in AD-sensitive regions and voxel-wise, controlling for age and sex. Then, comparisons of correlations between lifestyle at each life period, as well as between specific versus non-specific activities, and neuroimaging outcomes were performed.

ResultsOf the 135 older adults (mean age=69.3{&#43;/-}3.79), 61.5% were women. No significant association was found between LEQ scores and AD-sensitive regions. While LEQ-young was not associated with neuroimaging, LEQ-midlife was more strongly associated with GMv, including in the anterior cingulate cortex, and with amyloid burden in the precuneus compared to the other periods. LEQ-late showed stronger associations with perfusion and glucose metabolism than LEQ-young and LEQ-midlife in medial frontal regions. Lower amyloid burden was more strongly correlated with LEQ-midlife specific than non-specific activities (z=-2.0977, p&lt;.05, [95% CI, -0.3985 - -0.0102]) while perfusion was more strongly correlated with LEQ-late non-specific than specific scores (z=2.4369, p&lt;.01, [95% CI, 0.0.415-0.4165]).

Conclusions and RelevanceLifestyle at different life periods might have complementary benefits on structural/molecular versus functional markers of brain health in late-life. Interestingly, these associations were found in regions related to reserve/resilience and aging.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRecent studies have identified brain somatic variants as a cause of focal epilepsy. These studies relied on resected tissue from epilepsy surgery which is not available in most patients. The use of trace tissue adherent to depth electrodes used for stereo electroencephalography (stereo EEG) has been proposed as an alternative but is hampered by the low cell quality and contamination by non-brain cells. Here, we use our improved depth electrode harvesting technique that purifies neuronal nuclei to achieve molecular diagnosis in a patient with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).

MethodsDepth electrode tips were collected, pooled by brain region and seizure onset zone, nuclei isolated and sorted using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS). Somatic DNA was amplified from neuronal and astrocyte nuclei using primary template amplification followed by exome sequencing of neuronal DNA from the affected pool, unaffected pool, and saliva. The identified variant was validated using droplet digital PCR.

ResultsAn adolescent male with drug-resistant genetic-structural epilepsy due to left anterior insula FCD had daily focal aware seizures. Stereo EEG confirmed seizure onset in the left anterior insula. The two anterior insula electrodes were combined as the affected pool and three frontal electrodes as the unaffected pool. FANS isolated 140 neuronal nuclei from the affected and 245 neuronal nuclei from the unaffected pool. A novel somatic missense MTOR variant (p.Leu489Met, CADD score 23.7) was identified in the affected neuronal sample. Droplet digital PCR confirmed a mosaic gradient (VAF 0.78% in affected neuronal sample, variant was absent in all other samples).

ConclusionsOur finding confirms that harvesting neuronal DNA from depth electrodes followed by molecular analysis to identify brain somatic variants is feasible. Our novel method represents a significant improvement compared to the previous method by focusing the analysis on high quality cells of the cell type of interest.</p>

ParticipantsWe matched individuals with JME on valproate (n=36) to a group of healthy controls (n=36), as well as individuals with JME not on valproate (n=36) and a group of people with temporal lobe epilepsy (n=19) on valproate using propensity scores for age, sex, occurrence of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and drug refractoriness.

Main outcomes and MeasuresAll participants underwent structural T1-weighted brain imaging and MRI-derived vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness were calculated. Results were reported in effect-sizes using cohens d.

ResultsCompared to healthy controls, individuals with JME on valproate demonstrated cortical thinning bilaterally in the precentral gyri (left: d = -1.0, p &lt;.001; right: d = -1.0, p &lt;.001). This effect was localized to the left precentral gyrus when comparing JME on VPA with individuals with JME not on valproate (d = -0.89; p&lt;.01) or with individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy on valproate (d = -0.18, p &lt;.001). No significant differences in cortical thickness were detected between individuals with JME not on valproate and healthy controls. Cortical thinning in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and superior frontal was more marked with increasing valproate dose (left: t = -6,65, p &lt;.0001; right: t = -5,20, p &lt;.0001).

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cross-sectional study of 91 patients with epilepsy, valproate treatment was associated with JME-specific and dose-dependent cortical thinning of the precentral gyri. Our findings suggest a valproate-induced reorganization of disease-specific areas in JME that may not only help explain the high efficacy of this medication in IGEs but also potentially account for previously described changes of cortical thickness in this disease group.</p>
