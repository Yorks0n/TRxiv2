Here we use proximity extension-based multiplex assays to establish the specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic changes that underlie DLB in an unprecedented well-characterized cohort of 109 DLB patients, 235 patients with Alzheime[r]s disease (AD) and 190 controls. We identified more than 50 CSF proteins dysregulated in DLB, which were especially related to myelination processes. An enzyme involved in dopamine biosynthesis (L-amino acid decarboxylase, DDC) was the strongest dysregulated protein in DLB (\u003e1.5 fold-change vs.CON or AD; q\u003c1E-16) and could discriminate DLB from controls and AD patients with high accuracy (AUC: 0.91 and 0.81 respectively). We modelled a CSF protein panel containing only seven of these markers, which discriminate DLB from AD with higher performance (AUC: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.86-0.98). We developed custom multiplex assays for six of these markers (DDC, CRH, MMP-3, ABL1, MMP-10 and THOP1); and validated their performance in independent cohorts (n=329; AUCs: 0.68-0.90), including an autopsy cohort (n=76; AUCs: 0.90-0.95). This extensive and unique DLB CSF proteome study depicts specific protein changes underlying DLB pathophysiology. It translates these findings into a custom CSF biomarker panel able to identify DLB patients with high accuracy in different independent cohorts, providing new testing opportunities for diagnostic settings and clinical trials.\nDiagnostic accuracy of the plasma ALZpath pTau217 immunoassay to identify Alzheimers disease pathology\nAuthors: Ashton, N. J.; Brum, W. S.; di Molfetta, G.; Benedet, A. L.; Arslan, B.; Jonaitis, E. M.; Langhough, R. E.; Cody, K.; Wilson, R.; Carlsson, C. M.; Vanmechelen, E.; Montoliu-Gaya, L.; Lantro-Rodriguez, J.; Rahmouni, N.; Tissot, C.; Stevenson, J.; Servaes, S.; Therriault, J.; Pascoal, T. A.; Lleo, A.; Alcolea, D.; Fortea, J.; Rosa-Neto, P.; Johnson, S.; Jeromin, A.; Blennow, K.; Zetterberg, H.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.23292493\nImportancePhosphorylated tau (pTau) is a specific blood biomarker for Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, with pTau217 considered to have the most utility. However, availability of pTau217 tests for research and clinical use has been limited. Expanding access to this highly accurate AD biomarker is crucial for wider evaluation and implementation of AD blood tests. ObjectiveTo determine the utility of a novel and commercially available Single molecule array (Simoa) for plasma pTau217 (ALZpath) to detect AD pathology. To evaluate references ranges for abnormal A{beta} across three selected cohorts. Design, Setting, ParticipantsThree single-centre observational cohorts were involved in the study: Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD), Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP), and Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN). MRI, A{beta}-PET, and tau-PET data were available for TRIAD and WRAP, while CSF biomarkers were additionally measured in a subset of TRIAD and SPIN. Plasma measurements of pTau181, pTau217 (ALZpath), pTau231, A{beta}42/40, GFAP, and NfL, were available for all cohorts. Longitudinal blood biomarker data spanning 3 years for TRIAD and 8 years for WRAP were included. ExposuresMRI, A{beta}-PET, tau-PET, CSF biomarkers (A{beta}42/40 and pTau immunoassays) and plasma pTau217 (ALZpath Simoa). Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of plasma pTau217 for detecting abnormal amyloid and tau pathology. Longitudinal pTau217 change according to baseline pathology status. ResultsThe study included 786 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [9.7] years; 504 females [64.1%]) were included in the study. High accuracy was observed in identifying elevated A{beta} (AUC, 0.92-0.96; 95%CI 0.89-0.99) and tau pathology (AUC, 0.93-0.97; 95%CI 0.84-0.99) across all cohorts. These accuracies were significantly higher than other plasma biomarker combinations and comparable to CSF biomarkers. The detection of abnormal A{beta} pathology using binary or three-range references yielded reproducible results. Longitudinally, plasma pTau217 showed an annual increase only in A{beta}-positive individuals, with the highest increase observed in those with tau-positivity. Conclusions and RelevanceThe ALZpath plasma pTau217 Simoa assay accurately identifies biological AD, comparable to CSF biomarkers, with reproducible cut-offs across cohorts. It detects longitudinal changes, including at the preclinical stage, and is the first widely available, accessible, and scalable blood test for pTau217 detection. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the capabilities of the ALZpath plasma pTau217 Single molecule array (Simoa) to identify Alzheimers disease (AD) pathophysiology? FindingsALZpath pTau217 showed similar accuracies to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in identifying abnormal A{beta} and tau pathologies. Calculated reference ranges for detecting abnormal A{beta} were consistent across three cohorts. Over 8 years, the largest change of pTau217 was in individuals positive for both A{beta} and tau. MeaningThese results demonstrate the high-performance of the ALZpath plasma pTau217 Simoa in identifying AD-type pathophysiology. The wider availability of high-performing assays will expedite the use of blood biomarkers in clinical settings and benefit the research community.\nEvaluating the Performance of Large Language Models on a Neurology Board-Style Examination\nAuthors: Schubert, M. C.; Wick, W.; Venkataramani, V.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292598\nBackground and ObjectivesRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive potential in a wide array of applications, including healthcare. While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the performance of these models in neurology board exams remains unexplored. MethodsAn exploratory, prospective study was conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, designed as part of a self-assessment program. Questions were presented in a single best answer, multiple-choice format. The results from the question bank were validated with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions. The performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was assessed in relation to overall performance, question type, and topic. In addition, the confidence level in responses and the reproducibility of correctly and incorrectly answered questions was evaluated. Univariable analysis was carried out. Chi-squared test and Bonferroni correction were used to determine performance differences based on question characteristics. To differentiate characteristics of correctly and incorrectly answered questions, a high-dimensional tSNE analysis of the question representations was performed. ResultsIn May 2023, GPT-3.5 correctly answered 66.8 % of 1956 questions, whereas GPT-4 demonstrated a higher performance level, correctly answering 85 % of questions in congruence with near-passing and passing of the neurology board exam. GPT-4s performance surpassed both GPT-3.5 and question bank users (mean human user score: 73.8%). An analysis of twenty-six question categories showed that GPT-4 outperformed human users in Behavioral, Cognitive and Psych-related questions and demonstrated superior performance to GPT-3.5 in six categories. Both models performed better on lower-order than higher-order questions according to Bloom Taxonomy for learning and assessment (GPT4: 790 of 893 (88.5%) vs. 872 of 1063 (82%), GPT-3.5: 639 of 893 (71.6%) vs. 667 of 1063 (62.7%)) with GPT-4 also excelling in both lower-order and higher-order questions. The use of confident language was observed consistently across both models, even when incorrect (GPT-4: 99.3%, 292 of 294 incorrect answers, GPT-3.5: 100%, 650 of 650 incorrect answers). Reproducible answers of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (defined as more than 75 % same output across 50 independent queries) were associated with a higher percentage of correct answers (GPT-3.5: 66 of 88 (75%), GPT-4: 78 of 96 (81.3%)) than inconsistent answers, (GPT-3.5: 5 of 13 (38.5%), GPT-4: 1 of 4 (25%)). Lastly, the high-dimensional embedding analysis of correctly and incorrectly answered questions revealed no clear differentiation into distinct clusters. DiscussionDespite the absence of neurology-specific training, GPT-4 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas GPT-3.5 performed slightly below the human average question bank user. Higher-order cognitive tasks proved more challenging for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Notwithstanding, GPT-4s performance was equivalent to a passing grade for specialized neurology board exams. These findings suggest that with further refinements, LLMs like GPT-4 could play a pivotal role in applications for clinical neurology and healthcare in general.\nThe SORL1 p.Y1816C variant causes impaired endosomal dimerization and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Jensen, A. M.; Raska, J.; Fojtik, P.; Monti, G.; Lunding, M.; Vochyanova, S.; Pospisilova, V.; van der Lee, S. J.; Van Dongen, J.; Bossaerts, L.; Van Broeckhoven, C.; Dols, O.; Lleo, A.; Benussi, L.; Ghidoni, R.; Hulsman, M.; Sleegers, K.; Bohaciakova, D.; Holstege, H.; Andersen, O.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.09.23292253\nTruncating genetic variants of SORL1, encoding the endosome recycling receptor SORLA, have been accepted as causal of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, most genetic variants observed in SORL1 are missense variants, for which it is complicated to determine the pathogenicity level because carriers come from pedigrees too small to be informative for penetrance estimations. Here, we describe three unrelated families in which the SORL1 coding missense variant rs772677709, that leads to a p.Y1816C substitution, segregates with Alzheimers disease. Further, we investigate the effect of SORLA p.Y1816C on receptor maturation, cellular localization and trafficking in cell-based assays. Under physiological circumstances, SORLA dimerizes within the endosome, allowing retromer-dependent trafficking from the endosome to the cell surface, where the luminal part is shed into the extracellular space (sSORLA). Our results showed that the p.Y1816C mutant impairs SORLA dimerization in the endosome leading to a strong decrease in trafficking to the cell surface, resulting in decreased sSORLA shedding. Furthermore, we find that iPSC-derived neurons with engineered p.Y1816C mutation have enlarged endosomes, a defining cytopathology of AD. Our studies provide genetic as well as functional evidence that the SORL1 p.Y1816C variant is causal for AD. The high penetrance of the mutation suggests this mutation should be considered in clinical genetic screening of multiplex early-onset AD families.\nBrain mechanisms explaining postural imbalance in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review\nAuthors: Hadi, Z.; Mahmud, M.; Seemungal, B. M.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.23292709\nPersisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG. The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction. In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.\nResting-state background features demonstrate multidien cycles in long-term EEG device recordings\nAuthors: Ojemann, W. K. S.; Scheid, B. H.; Mouchtaris, S.; Lucas, A.; LaRocque, J. J.; Aguila, C.; Ashourvan, A.; Caciagli, L.; Davis, K. A.; Conrad, E. C.; Litt, B.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.23291521\nBackgroundLongitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies Objective/HypothesisWe hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. MethodsWe analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation. ResultsBackground EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p \u003c 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p \u003c 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]). ConclusionsOur findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating, and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.

E.-W.; Olsen, A. S.; Ozenne, B.; Stenbaek, D. S.; Armand, S.; Madsen, M. K.; Knudsen, G. M.; Fisher, P. M.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292164\nInvestigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects). Each scan was accompanied by a plasma sample to quantify plasma drug levels and estimate brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, as well as a rating of subjective drug intensity. We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.\nA 3' UTR Deletion Is a Leading Candidate Causal Variant at the TMEM106B Locus Reducing Risk for FTLD-TDP\nAuthors: Chemparathy, A.; Le Guen, Y.; Zeng, Y.; Gorzynski, J.; Jensen, T.; Kasireddy, N.; Talozzi, L.; Belloy, M. E.; Stewart, I.; Gitler, A. D.; Wagner, A. D.; Mormino, E.; Henderson, V. W.; Wyss-Coray, T.; Ashley, E.; Greicius, M. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292312\nSingle nucleotide variants (SNVs) near TMEM106B have been associated with risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP pathology (FTLD-TDP) but the causal variant at this locus has not yet been isolated. The initial leading FTLD-TDP genome-wide association study (GWAS) hit at this locus, rs1990622, is intergenic and is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a TMEM106B coding SNV, rs3173615. We developed a long-read sequencing (LRS) dataset of 407 individuals in order to identify structural variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a prevalent 322 base pair deletion on the TMEM106B 3 untranslated region (UTR) that was in perfect linkage with rs1990622 and near-perfect linkage with rs3173615 (genotype discordance in two of 274 individuals who had LRS and short-read next-generation sequencing). In Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) participants, this deletion was in greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.920916, D=0.963472) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.883776, D=0.963575). rs1990622 and rs3173615 are less closely linked (R2=0.7403, D=0.9915) in African populations. Among African ancestry individuals in the ADSP, the deletion is in even greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.936841, D=0.976782) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.764242, D=0.974406). Querying publicly available genetic datasets with associated mRNA expression and protein levels, we confirmed that rs1990622 is consistently a protein quantitative trait locus but not an expression quantitative trait locus, consistent with a causal variant present on the TMEM106B 3UTR. In summary, the TMEM106B 3 UTR deletion is a large genetic variant on the TMEM106B transcript that is in higher LD with the leading GWAS hit rs1990622 than rs3173615 and may mediate the protective effect of this locus in neurodegenerative disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging and biofluid biomarkers specific for DLB are highly needed. Here we use proximity extension-based multiplex assays to establish the specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic changes that underlie DLB in an unprecedented well-characterized cohort of 109 DLB patients, 235 patients with Alzheime[r]s disease (AD) and 190 controls. We identified more than 50 CSF proteins dysregulated in DLB, which were especially related to myelination processes. An enzyme involved in dopamine biosynthesis (L-amino acid decarboxylase, DDC) was the strongest dysregulated protein in DLB (&gt;1.5 fold-change vs.CON or AD; q&lt;1E-16) and could discriminate DLB from controls and AD patients with high accuracy (AUC: 0.91 and 0.81 respectively). We modelled a CSF protein panel containing only seven of these markers, which discriminate DLB from AD with higher performance (AUC: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.86-0.98). We developed custom multiplex assays for six of these markers (DDC, CRH, MMP-3, ABL1, MMP-10 and THOP1); and validated their performance in independent cohorts (n=329; AUCs: 0.68-0.90), including an autopsy cohort (n=76; AUCs: 0.90-0.95). This extensive and unique DLB CSF proteome study depicts specific protein changes underlying DLB pathophysiology. It translates these findings into a custom CSF biomarker panel able to identify DLB patients with high accuracy in different independent cohorts, providing new testing opportunities for diagnostic settings and clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhosphorylated tau (pTau) is a specific blood biomarker for Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, with pTau217 considered to have the most utility. However, availability of pTau217 tests for research and clinical use has been limited. Expanding access to this highly accurate AD biomarker is crucial for wider evaluation and implementation of AD blood tests.

ObjectiveTo determine the utility of a novel and commercially available Single molecule array (Simoa) for plasma pTau217 (ALZpath) to detect AD pathology. To evaluate references ranges for abnormal A{beta} across three selected cohorts.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsThree single-centre observational cohorts were involved in the study: Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD), Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP), and Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN). MRI, A{beta}-PET, and tau-PET data were available for TRIAD and WRAP, while CSF biomarkers were additionally measured in a subset of TRIAD and SPIN. Plasma measurements of pTau181, pTau217 (ALZpath), pTau231, A{beta}42/40, GFAP, and NfL, were available for all cohorts. Longitudinal blood biomarker data spanning 3 years for TRIAD and 8 years for WRAP were included.

ExposuresMRI, A{beta}-PET, tau-PET, CSF biomarkers (A{beta}42/40 and pTau immunoassays) and plasma pTau217 (ALZpath Simoa).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of plasma pTau217 for detecting abnormal amyloid and tau pathology. Longitudinal pTau217 change according to baseline pathology status.

ResultsThe study included 786 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [9.7] years; 504 females [64.1%]) were included in the study. High accuracy was observed in identifying elevated A{beta} (AUC, 0.92-0.96; 95%CI 0.89-0.99) and tau pathology (AUC, 0.93-0.97; 95%CI 0.84-0.99) across all cohorts. These accuracies were significantly higher than other plasma biomarker combinations and comparable to CSF biomarkers. The detection of abnormal A{beta} pathology using binary or three-range references yielded reproducible results. Longitudinally, plasma pTau217 showed an annual increase only in A{beta}-positive individuals, with the highest increase observed in those with tau-positivity.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe ALZpath plasma pTau217 Simoa assay accurately identifies biological AD, comparable to CSF biomarkers, with reproducible cut-offs across cohorts. It detects longitudinal changes, including at the preclinical stage, and is the first widely available, accessible, and scalable blood test for pTau217 detection.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the capabilities of the ALZpath plasma pTau217 Single molecule array (Simoa) to identify Alzheimers disease (AD) pathophysiology?

FindingsALZpath pTau217 showed similar accuracies to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in identifying abnormal A{beta} and tau pathologies. Calculated reference ranges for detecting abnormal A{beta} were consistent across three cohorts. Over 8 years, the largest change of pTau217 was in individuals positive for both A{beta} and tau.

MeaningThese results demonstrate the high-performance of the ALZpath plasma pTau217 Simoa in identifying AD-type pathophysiology. The wider availability of high-performing assays will expedite the use of blood biomarkers in clinical settings and benefit the research community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectivesRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive potential in a wide array of applications, including healthcare. While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the performance of these models in neurology board exams remains unexplored.

MethodsAn exploratory, prospective study was conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, designed as part of a self-assessment program. Questions were presented in a single best answer, multiple-choice format. The results from the question bank were validated with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions. The performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was assessed in relation to overall performance, question type, and topic. In addition, the confidence level in responses and the reproducibility of correctly and incorrectly answered questions was evaluated. Univariable analysis was carried out. Chi-squared test and Bonferroni correction were used to determine performance differences based on question characteristics. To differentiate characteristics of correctly and incorrectly answered questions, a high-dimensional tSNE analysis of the question representations was performed.

ResultsIn May 2023, GPT-3.5 correctly answered 66.8 % of 1956 questions, whereas GPT-4 demonstrated a higher performance level, correctly answering 85 % of questions in congruence with near-passing and passing of the neurology board exam. GPT-4s performance surpassed both GPT-3.5 and question bank users (mean human user score: 73.8%). An analysis of twenty-six question categories showed that GPT-4 outperformed human users in Behavioral, Cognitive and Psych-related questions and demonstrated superior performance to GPT-3.5 in six categories. Both models performed better on lower-order than higher-order questions according to Bloom Taxonomy for learning and assessment (GPT4: 790 of 893 (88.5%) vs. 872 of 1063 (82%), GPT-3.5: 639 of 893 (71.6%) vs. 667 of 1063 (62.7%)) with GPT-4 also excelling in both lower-order and higher-order questions. The use of confident language was observed consistently across both models, even when incorrect (GPT-4: 99.3%, 292 of 294 incorrect answers, GPT-3.5: 100%, 650 of 650 incorrect answers). Reproducible answers of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (defined as more than 75 % same output across 50 independent queries) were associated with a higher percentage of correct answers (GPT-3.5: 66 of 88 (75%), GPT-4: 78 of 96 (81.3%)) than inconsistent answers, (GPT-3.5: 5 of 13 (38.5%), GPT-4: 1 of 4 (25%)). Lastly, the high-dimensional embedding analysis of correctly and incorrectly answered questions revealed no clear differentiation into distinct clusters.

DiscussionDespite the absence of neurology-specific training, GPT-4 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas GPT-3.5 performed slightly below the human average question bank user. Higher-order cognitive tasks proved more challenging for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Notwithstanding, GPT-4s performance was equivalent to a passing grade for specialized neurology board exams. These findings suggest that with further refinements, LLMs like GPT-4 could play a pivotal role in applications for clinical neurology and healthcare in general.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Truncating genetic variants of SORL1, encoding the endosome recycling receptor SORLA, have been accepted as causal of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, most genetic variants observed in SORL1 are missense variants, for which it is complicated to determine the pathogenicity level because carriers come from pedigrees too small to be informative for penetrance estimations. Here, we describe three unrelated families in which the SORL1 coding missense variant rs772677709, that leads to a p.Y1816C substitution, segregates with Alzheimers disease. Further, we investigate the effect of SORLA p.Y1816C on receptor maturation, cellular localization and trafficking in cell-based assays. Under physiological circumstances, SORLA dimerizes within the endosome, allowing retromer-dependent trafficking from the endosome to the cell surface, where the luminal part is shed into the extracellular space (sSORLA). Our results showed that the p.Y1816C mutant impairs SORLA dimerization in the endosome leading to a strong decrease in trafficking to the cell surface, resulting in decreased sSORLA shedding. Furthermore, we find that iPSC-derived neurons with engineered p.Y1816C mutation have enlarged endosomes, a defining cytopathology of AD.

Our studies provide genetic as well as functional evidence that the SORL1 p.Y1816C variant is causal for AD. The high penetrance of the mutation suggests this mutation should be considered in clinical genetic screening of multiplex early-onset AD families.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Persisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature.

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG.

The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLongitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies

Objective/HypothesisWe hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles.

MethodsWe analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation.

ResultsBackground EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p &lt; 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p &lt; 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]).

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating, and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.

        <p class="abstract">Investigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased  brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects). Each scan was accompanied by a plasma sample to quantify plasma drug levels and estimate brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, as well as a rating of subjective drug intensity. We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of  brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) near TMEM106B have been associated with risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP pathology (FTLD-TDP) but the causal variant at this locus has not yet been isolated. The initial leading FTLD-TDP genome-wide association study (GWAS) hit at this locus, rs1990622, is intergenic and is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a TMEM106B coding SNV, rs3173615. We developed a long-read sequencing (LRS) dataset of 407 individuals in order to identify structural variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a prevalent 322 base pair deletion on the TMEM106B 3 untranslated region (UTR) that was in perfect linkage with rs1990622 and near-perfect linkage with rs3173615 (genotype discordance in two of 274 individuals who had LRS and short-read next-generation sequencing). In Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) participants, this deletion was in greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.920916, D=0.963472) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.883776, D=0.963575). rs1990622 and rs3173615 are less closely linked (R2=0.7403, D=0.9915) in African populations. Among African ancestry individuals in the ADSP, the deletion is in even greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.936841, D=0.976782) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.764242, D=0.974406). Querying publicly available genetic datasets with associated mRNA expression and protein levels, we confirmed that rs1990622 is consistently a protein quantitative trait locus but not an expression quantitative trait locus, consistent with a causal variant present on the TMEM106B 3UTR. In summary, the TMEM106B 3 UTR deletion is a large genetic variant on the TMEM106B transcript that is in higher LD with the leading GWAS hit rs1990622 than rs3173615 and may mediate the protective effect of this locus in neurodegenerative disease.</p>
