N.; Mao-Draayer, Y.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291875\nBackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Clinical presentation and disease course are highly heterogeneous. Typically, disease progression occurs over time and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of disability. The risk of developing MS is driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. How the commensal gut microbiota impacts disease severity and progression over time remains unknown. MethodsIn a longitudinal study, disability status and associated clinical features in 60 MS patients were tracked over 4.2 {+/-} 0.97 years, and the baseline fecal gut microbiome was characterized via 16S amplicon sequencing. Progressor status, defined as patients with an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were correlated with features of the gut microbiome to determine candidate microbiota associated with risk of MS disease progression. ResultsWe found no overt differences in microbial community diversity and overall structure between MS patients exhibiting disease progression and non-progressors. However, a total of 45 bacterial species were associated with worsening disease, including a marked depletion in Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with an expansion of Alloprevotella, Prevotella-9, and Rhodospirillales. Analysis of the metabolic potential of the inferred metagenome from taxa associated with progression revealed a significant enrichment in oxidative stress-inducing aerobic respiration at the expense of microbial vitamin K2 production (linked to Akkermansia), and a depletion in SCFA metabolism (linked to Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae). Further, statistical modeling demonstrated that microbiota composition and clinical features were sufficient to robustly predict disease progression. Additionally, we found that constipation, a frequent gastrointestinal comorbidity among MS patients, exhibited a divergent microbial signature compared with progressor status. ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the utility of the gut microbiome for predicting disease progression in MS. Further, analysis of the inferred metagenome revealed that oxidative stress, vitamin K2 and SCFAs are associated with progression.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19.

There are no up-to-date comprehensive reviews on the epidemiology, environmental and genetic risk factors, phenotypic characterization, and patient-reported outcomes of PD in Africa. This data is crucial to understanding the current and future burden and suggesting actionable and/or researchable gaps aimed at improving disease outcomes. MethodologyWe conducted a systematic literature search using the electronic databases of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCRT), EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), African Journals (AJOL) and other unpublished literature. We included all studies providing data on people with PD in Africa from the start of each database till February 2023. Studies were not restricted based on diagnostic criteria or language. Outcomes of interest were summarised based on epidemiology, genetics, environmental risk factors, clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcomes (experience and quality of life), disease management and outcomes, access to care, patient support, and healthcare workforce training. We also investigated collaboration between African countries (internal) and across continents/world regions (external) and journal impact factors. ResultsA total of 4,855 articles were identified, of which 180 were included in this review. The majority were published from North Africa (mainly from Tunisia, and involved collaboration with investigators from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America). West Africa (Nigeria), Southern Africa (South Africa) and East Africa (mainly Tanzania) also had a relatively high number of publications. Methodological design varied across studies. Based on the pre-determined outcomes, articles identified were genetics (67), clinical features (65), environmental risk factors (16), epidemiology (14), patient experience and quality of life (10), management and access to care (5) and education and training (3). ConclusionsThe main hubs of PD-related research output in Africa are the Northern, Western and Southern regions of Africa (although with limited involvement of countries within these regions). External collaboration (outside the continent) currently predominates. There are considerable actionable and researchable gaps across all outcomes of interest, with a dearth of published information on health workforce capacity building, disease management and access to care, patient and caregiver engagement, and quality of life of people with PD in Africa. We recommend strengthening existing and emerging intercontinental networks for research, education, training and policy formulation and funding, leveraging on more recent developments such as the International Parkinsons Disease Genomics Consortium-Africa (IPDGC-Africa), the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Africa Section (MDS-AS), World Health Organisation (WHO) and initiatives with similar objectives.\nResting-state background features demonstrate multidien cycles in long-term EEG device recordings\nAuthors: Ojemann, W. K. S.; Scheid, B. H.; Mouchtaris, S.; Lucas, A.; LaRocque, J. J.; Aguila, C.; Ashourvan, A.; Caciagli, L.; Davis, K. A.; Conrad, E. C.; Litt, B.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.23291521\nBackgroundLongitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies Objective/HypothesisWe hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. MethodsWe analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation. ResultsBackground EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p \u003c 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p \u003c 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]). ConclusionsOur findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating, and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.

C.; Wick, W.; Venkataramani, V.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292598\nSummary Background and Objectives Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive potential in a wide array of applications, including healthcare. While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the performance of these models in neurology board exams remains unexplored. Methods An exploratory, prospective study was conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and were validated with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions based on Bloom Taxonomy for learning and assessment. Performance was assessed in relation to overall scores, question type, and topics, along with the confidence level and reproducibility of answers. Results GPT-4 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 by correctly answering 85% of 1956 questions compared to GPT-3.5 (66.8%) Notably, GPT-4's performance was above the average human score of 73.8%, effectively achieving near-passing and passing grades in the neurology board exam. GPT-4 outperformed human users in Behavioral, Cognitive and Psych-related questions and demonstrated superior performance to GPT-3.5 in six categories. Both models performed better on lower-order than higher-order questions (GPT4: 790 of 893 (88.5%) vs. 872 of 1063 (82%), GPT-3.5: 639 of 893 (71.6%) vs. 667 of 1063 (62.7%)) with GPT-4 also excelling in both lower-order and higher-order questions. Both models consistently used confident language, even when providing incorrect answers (GPT-4: 99.3%, 294 incorrect answers, GPT-3.5: 100%, 650 incorrect answers). Reproducible answers of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (more than 75 % same output across 50 independent queries) were associated with a higher percentage of correct answers (GPT-3.5: 66 of 88 (75%), GPT-4: 78 of 96 (81.3%)) than inconsistent answers, (GPT-3.5: 5 of 13 (38.5%), GPT-4: 1 of 4 (25%)). Discussion Despite the absence of neurology-specific training, GPT-4 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas GPT-3.5 performed slightly below the human average. While higher-order cognitive tasks were more challenging for both models, GPT-4's results were equivalent to passing grades in specialized neurology exams. These findings suggests that LLMs like GPT-4 could have significant applications in clinical neurology and healthcare with further refinements.\nNavigating the chaos of psychedelic neuroimaging: A multi-metric evaluation of acute psilocybin effects on brain entropy\nAuthors: McCulloch, D. E.-W.; Olsen, A. S.; Ozenne, B.; Stenbaek, D. S.; Armand, S.; Madsen, M. K.; Knudsen, G. M.; Fisher, P. M.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292164\nInvestigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects). Each scan was accompanied by a plasma sample to quantify plasma drug levels and estimate brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, as well as a rating of subjective drug intensity. We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Clinical presentation and disease course are highly heterogeneous. Typically, disease progression occurs over time and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of disability. The risk of developing MS is driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. How the commensal gut microbiota impacts disease severity and progression over time remains unknown.

MethodsIn a longitudinal study, disability status and associated clinical features in 60 MS patients were tracked over 4.2 {&#43;/-} 0.97 years, and the baseline fecal gut microbiome was characterized via 16S amplicon sequencing. Progressor status, defined as patients with an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were correlated with features of the gut microbiome to determine candidate microbiota associated with risk of MS disease progression.

ResultsWe found no overt differences in microbial community diversity and overall structure between MS patients exhibiting disease progression and non-progressors. However, a total of 45 bacterial species were associated with worsening disease, including a marked depletion in Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with an expansion of Alloprevotella, Prevotella-9, and Rhodospirillales. Analysis of the metabolic potential of the inferred metagenome from taxa associated with progression revealed a significant enrichment in oxidative stress-inducing aerobic respiration at the expense of microbial vitamin K2 production (linked to Akkermansia), and a depletion in SCFA metabolism (linked to Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae). Further, statistical modeling demonstrated that microbiota composition and clinical features were sufficient to robustly predict disease progression. Additionally, we found that constipation, a frequent gastrointestinal comorbidity among MS patients, exhibited a divergent microbial signature compared with progressor status.

ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the utility of the gut microbiome for predicting disease progression in MS. Further, analysis of the inferred metagenome revealed that oxidative stress, vitamin K2 and SCFAs are associated with progression.

        <p class="abstract">Dysautonomia has substantially impacted acute COVID-19 severity as well as symptom burden after recovery from COVID-19 (long COVID), yet the underlying causes remain unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionParkinsons disease (PD) has become a global public health challenge as disability and death due to the disease are growing rapidly in comparison to other neurological disorders. There are no up-to-date comprehensive reviews on the epidemiology, environmental and genetic risk factors, phenotypic characterization, and patient-reported outcomes of PD in Africa. This data is crucial to understanding the current and future burden and suggesting actionable and/or researchable gaps aimed at improving disease outcomes.

MethodologyWe conducted a systematic literature search using the electronic databases of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCRT), EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), African Journals (AJOL) and other unpublished literature. We included all studies providing data on people with PD in Africa from the start of each database till February 2023. Studies were not restricted based on diagnostic criteria or language. Outcomes of interest were summarised based on epidemiology, genetics, environmental risk factors, clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcomes (experience and quality of life), disease management and outcomes, access to care, patient support, and healthcare workforce training. We also investigated collaboration between African countries (internal) and across continents/world regions (external) and journal impact factors.

ResultsA total of 4,855 articles were identified, of which 180 were included in this review. The majority were published from North Africa (mainly from Tunisia, and involved collaboration with investigators from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America). West Africa (Nigeria), Southern Africa (South Africa) and East Africa (mainly Tanzania) also had a relatively high number of publications. Methodological design varied across studies. Based on the pre-determined outcomes, articles identified were genetics (67), clinical features (65), environmental risk factors (16), epidemiology (14), patient experience and quality of life (10), management and access to care (5) and education and training (3).

ConclusionsThe main hubs of PD-related research output in Africa are the Northern, Western and Southern regions of Africa (although with limited involvement of countries within these regions). External collaboration (outside the continent) currently predominates. There are considerable actionable and researchable gaps across all outcomes of interest, with a dearth of published information on health workforce capacity building, disease management and access to care, patient and caregiver engagement, and quality of life of people with PD in Africa. We recommend strengthening existing and emerging intercontinental networks for research, education, training and policy formulation and funding, leveraging on more recent developments such as the International Parkinsons Disease Genomics Consortium-Africa (IPDGC-Africa), the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Africa Section (MDS-AS), World Health Organisation (WHO) and initiatives with similar objectives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLongitudinal EEG recorded by implanted devices is critical for understanding and managing epilepsy. Recent research reports patient-specific, multi-day cycles in device-detected epileptiform events that coincide with increased likelihood of clinical seizures. Understanding these cycles could elucidate mechanisms generating seizures and advance drug and neurostimulation therapies

Objective/HypothesisWe hypothesize that seizure-correlated cycles are present in background neural activity, independent of interictal epileptiform spikes, and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles.

MethodsWe analyzed regularly-recorded seizure-free data epochs from 20 patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for at least 1.5 years, to explore the relationship between cycles in device-detected interictal epileptiform activity (dIEA), clinician-validated interictal spikes, background EEG features, and neurostimulation.

ResultsBackground EEG features tracked the cycle phase of dIEA in all patients (AUC: 0.63 [0.56 - 0.67]) with a greater effect size compared to clinically annotated spike rate alone (AUC: 0.55 [0.53-0.61], p &lt; 0.01). After accounting for circadian variation and spike rate, we observed significant population trends in elevated theta and beta band power and theta and alpha connectivity features at the cycle peaks (sign test, p &lt; 0.05). In the period directly after stimulation we observe a decreased association between cycle phase and EEG features compared to background recordings (AUC: 0.58 [0.55-0.64]).

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that seizure-correlated dIEA cycles are not solely due to epileptiform discharges but are associated with background measures of brain state; and that neurostimulation may disrupt these cycles. These results may help elucidate mechanisms underlying seizure generation, provide new biomarkers for seizure risk, and facilitate monitoring, treating, and managing epilepsy with implantable devices.

        <p class="abstract">Summary Background and Objectives Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive potential in a wide array of applications, including healthcare. While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the performance of these models in neurology board exams remains unexplored. Methods An exploratory, prospective study was conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and were validated with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions based on Bloom Taxonomy for learning and assessment. Performance was assessed in relation to overall scores, question type, and topics, along with the confidence level and reproducibility of answers. Results GPT-4 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 by correctly answering 85% of 1956 questions compared to GPT-3.5 (66.8%) Notably, GPT-4&#39;s performance was above the average human score of 73.8%, effectively achieving near-passing and passing grades in the neurology board exam. GPT-4 outperformed human users in Behavioral, Cognitive and Psych-related questions and demonstrated superior performance to GPT-3.5 in six categories. Both models performed better on lower-order than higher-order questions (GPT4: 790 of 893 (88.5%) vs. 872 of 1063 (82%), GPT-3.5: 639 of 893 (71.6%) vs. 667 of 1063 (62.7%)) with GPT-4 also excelling in both lower-order and higher-order questions. Both models consistently used confident language, even when providing incorrect answers (GPT-4: 99.3%, 294 incorrect answers, GPT-3.5: 100%, 650 incorrect answers). Reproducible answers of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (more than 75 % same output across 50 independent queries) were associated with a higher percentage of correct answers (GPT-3.5: 66 of 88 (75%), GPT-4: 78 of 96 (81.3%)) than inconsistent answers, (GPT-3.5: 5 of 13 (38.5%), GPT-4: 1 of 4 (25%)). Discussion Despite the absence of neurology-specific training, GPT-4 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas GPT-3.5 performed slightly below the human average. While higher-order cognitive tasks were more challenging for both models, GPT-4&#39;s results were equivalent to passing grades in specialized neurology exams. These findings suggests that LLMs like GPT-4 could have significant applications in clinical neurology and healthcare with further refinements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Investigations into the acute effects of psychedelics on brain imaging have emphasised increased  brain entropy as a potential neural correlate. To date, 12 previous studies have reported brain entropy effects, each reporting a single and unique metric, none of which have been examined in an independent cohort. Here we evaluated acute psilocybin effects on these 12 brain entropy metrics in an independent cohort of 28 healthy participants. Following a single psilocybin dose, participants completed pre/post resting-state BOLD fMRI scans (28 pre-drug, 93 post-drug scans during the acute drug effects). Each scan was accompanied by a plasma sample to quantify plasma drug levels and estimate brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, as well as a rating of subjective drug intensity. We assessed relations between brain entropy and these measures with linear mixed-effects models. There was a significantly positive association for Shannon entropy of path-length and instantaneous correlation distributions and divergent associations of network-wise sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant psilocybin effects for seven of 12 brain-entropy metrics. Whole-brain entropy metrics showed limited correlations between each other. Our observations suggest a nuanced acute effect of psychedelics on brain entropy, underscoring the need for reproducing effects. The variable effects and limited inter-metric correlation undermines the generalisability of  brain entropy as a singular construct. Future studies in clinical cohorts are crucial to elucidate the link between these metrics and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>
