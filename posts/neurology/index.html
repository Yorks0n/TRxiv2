R.; Wiseman, K. N.; Sanchez-Castillo, M.; Billings, S.; Jepsen, W.; Huentelman, M.; Narayanan, V.\nScore: 524.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296768\nWe sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.\nExploring the local field potential signal from the subthalamic nucleus for phase-targeted auditory stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Krugliakova, E.; Karpovich, A.; Stieglitz, L.; Huwiler, S.; Lustenberger, C.; Imbach, L.; Bujan, B.; Jedrysiak, P.; Jacomet, M.; Baumann, C. R.; Fattinger, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297547\nBackgroundEnhancing slow waves, the electrophysiological (EEG) manifestation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, might offer therapeutic benefits for patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) by improving sleep quality and slowing disease progression. Phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) is an approach to enhance slow waves, which are detected in the surface EEG signal in real-time. ObjectiveWe aimed to test whether the local-field potential of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-LFP) can be used to detect frontal slow waves and evaluate the PTAS-related electrophysiologic changes. MethodsWe enrolled patients diagnosed with PD and undergoing Percept PC neurostimulator (Medtronic) implantation for the deep brain stimulation of STN (STN-DBS) in a two-step surgery. Patients participated in 3 full-night recordings, including one between-surgeries recording and two recordings during rehabilitation, one with DBS+ (on) and one with DBS-(off). Surface EEG and STN-LFP signals from Percept PC were recorded simultaneously, and PTAS was applied during sleep in all three recording sessions. ResultsOur results show that during NREM sleep, slow waves of the cortex and STN are time-locked. We observed the effects of PTAS in STN-LFP in all types of analyses, including spectral, coherence, and event-related potentials. ConclusionOur findings suggest that PTAS could be implemented using STN-LFP signal for slow wave detection. Additionally, we propose options for better STN-LFP signal preprocessing, including different referencing and filtering that could make the detection of the cortical slow waves in STN-LFP more reliable.\nHabitual and supplemented prebiotic diets and their links to inflammatory serum markers and hypothalamic microstructure in young, overweight adults: a pre-registered study.\nAuthors: Toews, E.; Medawar, E.; Thieleking, R.; Beyer, F.; Stumvoll, M.; Villringer, A.; Witte, V.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297892\nBackgroundPrebiotic dietary fiber and related metabolites have been suggested to attenuate low-grade systemic and central inflammation through improving gut-brain axis signaling. We here aimed to test whether habitual or short-term high-dose fiber intake is linked to inflammatory markers in blood and to indicators of central hypothalamic inflammation. MethodsIn total, 59 adults (19 women, aged 28.3 years {+/-} 6.6 SD, mean body mass index, BMI, 27.3 {+/-} 1.5 SD) were included into analyses. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla for provision of mean diffusivity (MD) as a marker of brain tissue inflammation and donated fasting blood. Measurements took place at up to 4 timepoints, i.e. before and after 14 days of supplementary fiber and placebo intake, respectively. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL6) were assessed in serum. The study was preregistered at https://osf.io/uzbav. ResultsHabitual and interventional high-fiber diet was not significantly associated with neither inflammatory markers (|{beta}intervention|\u003e 0.1, p \u003e 0.32) nor with hypothalamic MD (|{beta}intervention| = 1.8, p = 0.07) according to linear mixed effects modeling. Male sex and higher body fat mass related to higher CRP. Further, higher BMI was borderline related to lower hypothalamic MD. ConclusionsIn this sample of overweight adults, dietary fiber intake was not related to inflammatory blood markers or hypothalamic microstructure. Instead, sex and body composition were of higher importance for prediction of interindividual differences in markers of (neuro)inflammation. Significance StatementPrebiotic dietary fiber has been discussed to lower systemic and central inflammation. While previous studies investigated the effects of fiber on inflammatory blood markers, the knowledge of the effect of fiber on neuroinflammation is limited. Thus, in this pre-registered randomized controlled trial analysis we examined the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory markers in blood and hypothalamus. 3T MRI and blood markers were assessed before and after high-fiber intake and placebo in 59 adults. In our overweight study sample of 19-42 years old adults, fiber intake had no significant impact on inflammatory markers. The current null findings can inform future nutrition neuroimaging trials and add to the discussion about how diet may affect brain structure and function.\nGGC expansion in ZFHX3 causes SCA4 and impairs autophagy\nAuthors: Figueroa, K. P.; Gross, C.; Atienza, E. B.; Paul, S.; Gandelman, M.; Haack, T. B.; Kakar, N.; Sturm, M.; Casadei, N.; Admard, J.; Park, J.; Zühlke, C.; Hellenbroich, Y.; Pozojevic, J.; Balachandran, S.; Händler, K.; Zittel, S.; Timmann, D.; Erdlenbruch, F.; Herrmann, L.; Feindt, T.; Zenker, M.; Dufke, C.; Hübener-Schmid, J.; Scoles, D. R.; Koeppen, A.; Ossowski, S.; Spielmann, M.; Riess, O.; Pulst, S. M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297560\nDespite linkage to 16q in 1996, the mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4), a late-onset sensory and cerebellar ataxia, escaped detection for 25 years. Using long- read PacBio-HiFi and ONT-Nanopre sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified expansion of a GGC DNA repeat in a \u003e85% GC-rich region in exon 10 of the ZFHX3 gene coding for poly-glycine (polyG). In a total of 15 nuclear families from Utah and 9 from Europe, the repeat was expanded to \u003e40 repeats in SCA4 patients accompanied by significant phenotypic variation independent of repeat size compared to the most common normal repeat size of 21 repeats. The RE event likely occurred in a frequent Swedish haplotype shared by cases from Utah and Germany. Six characteristic ultra-rare SNVs in the vicinity of the RE in cases from Utah and Lubeck (Germany) indicate a common founder event for some of the patients. In fibroblast and iPS cells, the GGC expansion leads to increased ZFHX3 protein levels, polyG aggregates, and abnormal autophagy, which normalized with ZFHX3 siRNA. Increasing autophagic flux may provide a therapeutic avenue for this novel polyG disease.\nFTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes\nAuthors: Pasquini, L.; Pereira, F.; Seddighi, S.; Zeng, Y.; Ilan-Gala, I.; Vatsavayai, S.; Friedberg, A.; Lee, A.; Brown, J.; Spina, S.; Grinberg, L.; Sirkis, D.; Bonham, L.; Yokoyama, J.; Boxer, A.; Kramer, J.; Rosen, H.; Humphrey, J.; Gitler, A.; Miller, B.; Pollard, K.; Ward, M.; Seeley, W. W.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297687\nIn frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.\nGenome-wide association study identifies APOE and ZMIZ1 variants as mitophagy modifiers in Lewy body disease\nAuthors: Hou, X.; Heckman, M. G.; Fiesel, F. C.; Koga, S.; Soto-Beasley, A. I.; Watzlawik, J. O.; Zhao, J.; Valentino, R. R.; Johnson, P. W.; White, L. J.; Quicksall, Z. S.; Reddy, J. S.; Bras, J.; Guerreiro, R.; Zhao, N.; Bu, G.; Dickson, D. W.; Ross, O. A.; Springer, W.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297100\nThe PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; {beta}: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p=8.67x10-25) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; {beta}: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p=1.42x10-8). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4-carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain (ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimers disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.\nCalcitriol treatment is safe and increases frataxin levels in Friedreich Ataxia patients.\nAuthors: Alemany-Perna, B.; Tamarit, J.; Lopez Dominguez, D.; Quiroga-Varela, A.; Merchan-Ruiz, M.; Ramio Torrenta, L.; Genis Batlle, D.; Ros, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297713\nBackgroundCalcitriol, the active form of vitamin D (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), improves the phenotype and increases frataxin levels in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA). MethodsBased on these results, we started a pilot clinical trial in which a dose of 0.25mcg/24h was administered to 15 FRDA patients for a year. Evaluations of neurological function changes (SARA scale, 9-HPT, 8-MWT, PATA test) and quality of life (Barthel Scale and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire) were performed. Frataxin amounts were measured in isolated platelets obtained from these FRDA patients, from heterozygous FRDA carriers (relatives of the FA patients) and from non-heterozygous sex and age matched controls. ResultsAlthough the patients did not experience any observable neurological improvement, there was a statistically significant increase in frataxin levels from initial values, 5,6 pg/g, to 7,0 pg/g after 12 months. Differences in frataxin levels referred to total protein amounts were observed amongst sex and age matched controls (18.11 pg/g), relative controls (10.07 pg/g), and FRDA patients (5.71 pg/g). The treatment was well tolerated by most patients, and only some of them experienced minor adverse effects at the beginning of the trial. ConclusionCalcitriol dosage used (0.25mcg/24h) is safe for FRDA patients and it increases frataxin levels. We cannot rule out that higher doses administered longer could yield neurological benefits.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEnhancing slow waves, the electrophysiological (EEG) manifestation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, might offer therapeutic benefits for patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) by improving sleep quality and slowing disease progression. Phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) is an approach to enhance slow waves, which are detected in the surface EEG signal in real-time.

ObjectiveWe aimed to test whether the local-field potential of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-LFP) can be used to detect frontal slow waves and evaluate the PTAS-related electrophysiologic changes.

MethodsWe enrolled patients diagnosed with PD and undergoing Percept PC neurostimulator (Medtronic) implantation for the deep brain stimulation of STN (STN-DBS) in a two-step surgery. Patients participated in 3 full-night recordings, including one between-surgeries recording and two recordings during rehabilitation, one with DBS&#43; (on) and one with DBS-(off). Surface EEG and STN-LFP signals from Percept PC were recorded simultaneously, and PTAS was applied during sleep in all three recording sessions.

ResultsOur results show that during NREM sleep, slow waves of the cortex and STN are time-locked. We observed the effects of PTAS in STN-LFP in all types of analyses, including spectral, coherence, and event-related potentials.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that PTAS could be implemented using STN-LFP signal for slow wave detection. Additionally, we propose options for better STN-LFP signal preprocessing, including different referencing and filtering that could make the detection of the cortical slow waves in STN-LFP more reliable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrebiotic dietary fiber and related metabolites have been suggested to attenuate low-grade systemic and central inflammation through improving gut-brain axis signaling. We here aimed to test whether habitual or short-term high-dose fiber intake is linked to inflammatory markers in blood and to indicators of central hypothalamic inflammation.

MethodsIn total, 59 adults (19 women, aged 28.3 years {&#43;/-} 6.6 SD, mean body mass index, BMI, 27.3 {&#43;/-} 1.5 SD) were included into analyses. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla for provision of mean diffusivity (MD) as a marker of brain tissue inflammation and donated fasting blood. Measurements took place at up to 4 timepoints, i.e. before and after 14 days of supplementary fiber and placebo intake, respectively. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL6) were assessed in serum. The study was preregistered at https://osf.io/uzbav.

ResultsHabitual and interventional high-fiber diet was not significantly associated with neither inflammatory markers (|{beta}intervention|&gt; 0.1, p &gt; 0.32) nor with hypothalamic MD (|{beta}intervention| = 1.8, p = 0.07) according to linear mixed effects modeling. Male sex and higher body fat mass related to higher CRP. Further, higher BMI was borderline related to lower hypothalamic MD.

ConclusionsIn this sample of overweight adults, dietary fiber intake was not related to inflammatory blood markers or hypothalamic microstructure. Instead, sex and body composition were of higher importance for prediction of interindividual differences in markers of (neuro)inflammation.

Significance StatementPrebiotic dietary fiber has been discussed to lower systemic and central inflammation. While previous studies investigated the effects of fiber on inflammatory blood markers, the knowledge of the effect of fiber on neuroinflammation is limited. Thus, in this pre-registered randomized controlled trial analysis we examined the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory markers in blood and hypothalamus. 3T MRI and blood markers were assessed before and after high-fiber intake and placebo in 59 adults. In our overweight study sample of 19-42 years old adults, fiber intake had no significant impact on inflammatory markers. The current null findings can inform future nutrition neuroimaging trials and add to the discussion about how diet may affect brain structure and function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite linkage to 16q in 1996, the mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4), a late-onset sensory and cerebellar ataxia, escaped detection for 25 years. Using long- read PacBio-HiFi and ONT-Nanopre sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified expansion of a GGC DNA repeat in a &gt;85% GC-rich region in exon 10 of the ZFHX3 gene coding for poly-glycine (polyG). In a total of 15 nuclear families from Utah and 9 from Europe, the repeat was expanded to &gt;40 repeats in SCA4 patients accompanied by significant phenotypic variation independent of repeat size compared to the most common normal repeat size of 21 repeats. The RE event likely occurred in a frequent Swedish haplotype shared by cases from Utah and Germany. Six characteristic ultra-rare SNVs in the vicinity of the RE in cases from Utah and Lubeck (Germany) indicate a common founder event for some of the patients. In fibroblast and iPS cells, the GGC expansion leads to increased ZFHX3 protein levels, polyG aggregates, and abnormal autophagy, which normalized with ZFHX3 siRNA. Increasing autophagic flux may provide a therapeutic avenue for this novel polyG disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; {beta}: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p=8.67x10-25) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; {beta}: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p=1.42x10-8). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4-carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain (ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimers disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCalcitriol, the active form of vitamin D (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), improves the phenotype and increases frataxin levels in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA).

MethodsBased on these results, we started a pilot clinical trial in which a dose of 0.25mcg/24h was administered to 15 FRDA patients for a year. Evaluations of neurological function changes (SARA scale, 9-HPT, 8-MWT, PATA test) and quality of life (Barthel Scale and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire) were performed. Frataxin amounts were measured in isolated platelets obtained from these FRDA patients, from heterozygous FRDA carriers (relatives of the FA patients) and from non-heterozygous sex and age matched controls.

ResultsAlthough the patients did not experience any observable neurological improvement, there was a statistically significant increase in frataxin levels from initial values, 5,6 pg/g, to 7,0 pg/g after 12 months. Differences in frataxin levels referred to total protein amounts were observed amongst sex and age matched controls (18.11 pg/g), relative controls (10.07 pg/g), and FRDA patients (5.71 pg/g). The treatment was well tolerated by most patients, and only some of them experienced minor adverse effects at the beginning of the trial.

ConclusionCalcitriol dosage used (0.25mcg/24h) is safe for FRDA patients and it increases frataxin levels. We cannot rule out that higher doses administered longer could yield neurological benefits.</p>
