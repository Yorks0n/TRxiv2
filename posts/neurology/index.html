J.; Delis, I.; Brown, C.; Sivan, M.\nScore: 42.8, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298171\nLong COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.\nSmall Fiber Neuropathy after COVID-19: A Key to Long COVID\nAuthors: McAlpine, L.; Zubair, A.; Joseph, P.; Spudich, S.\nScore: 138.6, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23297764\nObjectivesReport a case series of new onset small fiber neuropathy (SFN) after COVID-19 treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment. MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment. ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS. DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.\nOcrelizumab B cell depletion has no effect on HERV RNA expression in PBMC in MS patients\nAuthors: Tarlinton, R. E.; Tanescu, R.; Shannon-Lowe, C.; Gran, B.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298370\nBackgroundEpstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection of B cells is now understood to be one of the triggering events for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a progressive immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. EBV infection is also linked to expression of Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of the HERV-W group, a further risk factor for the development of MS (Ocrelizumab is a high-potency disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for MS, which depletes B cells by targeting CD20. ObjectivesWe studied the effects of ocrelizumab on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from paired samples from 20 patients taken prior to and 6 months after beginning Ocrelizumab therapy. We hypothesised that EBV and HERV-W loads would be lower in post-treatment samples. MethodsSamples were collected in Paxgene tubes, subject to RNA extraction and Illumina paired end short read mRNA sequencing with mapping of sequence reads to the human genome using Salmon and Differential Gene expression compared with DeSeq2. Mapping was also performed separately to the HERV-D database of HERV sequences and the EBV reference sequence. ResultsPatient samples were more strongly clustered by individual rather than disease type (relapsing/remitting or primary progressive), treatment (pre and post), age, or sex. Fourteen genes, all clearly linked to B cell function were significantly down regulated in the post treatment samples. Interestingly only one pre-treatment sample had detectable EBV RNA and there were no significant differences in HERV expression (of any group) between pre- and post-treatment samples. ConclusionsWhile EBV and HERV expression are clearly linked to triggering MS pathogenesis, it does not appear that high level expression of these viruses is a part of the ongoing disease process or that changes in virus load are associated with Ocrelizumab treatment.\nLymphocyte profiles after a first demyelinating event suggestive of multiple sclerosis reveal early monocyte and B cell alterations\nAuthors: Alvarez-Gonzalez, C.; Wiedemann, A.; Schroeder-Castagno, M.; Asseyer, S.; Chien, C.; Kuchling, J.; Bellmann-Strobl, J.; Ruprecht, K.; Infante- Duarte, C.; Doerner, T.; Paul, F.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298459\nIntroductionOften, isolated clinical event suggestive of CNS demyelination confers a risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigate lymphocyte profiles after a first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), which could contribute to the current understanding of early inflammatory responses in this demyelinating disease. MethodsTwenty treatment-naive clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and fifteen healthy participants were included in our assessment of lymphocyte profiles and B cell subsets using multicolour flow cytometry. Analysis was made at 3-6 months (Baseline), 12, and 24 months after a first clinical event. We also performed a sub-analysis of patients that received glatiramer acetate (GLAT) after their baseline visit up to 24 months after the first clinical event. ResultsOur analysis revealed monocyte and B cell differences between groups. Percentages of CD19+CD20+ B cells were lower in CIS patients compared to healthy individuals at baseline. Additionally, monocyte distribution among groups was different. A subgroup analysis of patients treated with GLAT (n= 10) showed an increased percentage of naive (p\u003c0.05) and memory pre-switched (p\u003c0.01) B cells up to 24 months after their baseline visit compared to the untreated group (n= 10). ConclusionOur results showed early monocyte and B cell subsets alterations in pwCIS. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of B cells and monocyte disturbances during inflammatory processes after a first clinically-MS suggestive event.\nSerum proteomics reveals APOE dependent and independent protein signatures in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Frick, E. A.; Emilsson, V.; Jonmundsson, T.; Steindorsdottir, A. E.; Johnson, E. C. B.; Puerta, R.; Dammer, E. B.; Shantaraman, A.; Cano, A.; Boada, M.; Valero, S.; Garcia-Gonzalez, P.; Gudmundsson, E. F.; Gudjonsson, A.; Loureiro, J. J.; Orth, A. P.; Seyfried, N. T.; Levey, A. I.; Ruiz, A.; Aspelund, T.; Jennings, L. L.; Launer, L. J.; Gudmundsdottir, V.; Gudnason, V.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298251\nThe current demand for early intervention, prevention, and treatment of late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) warrants deeper understanding of the underlying molecular processes which could contribute to biomarker and drug target discovery. Utilizing high-throughput proteomic measurements in serum from a prospective population-based cohort of older adults (n=5,294), we identified 303 unique proteins associated with incident LOAD (median follow-up 12.8 years). Over 40% of these proteins were associated with LOAD independently of APOE-{varepsilon}4 carrier status. These proteins were implicated in neuronal processes and overlapped with protein signatures of LOAD in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We found 17 proteins which LOAD-association was strongly dependent on APOE-{varepsilon}4 carrier status. Most of them showed consistent associations with LOAD in cerebrospinal fluid and a third had brain-specific gene expression. Remarkably, four proteins in this group (TBCA, ARL2, S100A13 and IRF6) were downregulated by APOE-{varepsilon}4 yet upregulated as a consequence of LOAD as determined in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, reflecting a potential response to the disease onset. Accordingly, the direct association of these proteins to LOAD was reversed upon APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype adjustment, a finding which we replicate in an external cohort (n=719). Our findings provide an insight into the dysregulated pathways that may lead to the development and early detection of LOAD, including those both independent and dependent on APOE-{varepsilon}4. Importantly, many of the LOAD-associated proteins we find in the circulation have been found to be expressed - and have a direct link with AD - in brain tissue. Thus, the proteins identified here, and their upstream modulating pathways, provide a new source of circulating biomarker and therapeutic target candidates for LOAD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesReport a case series of new onset small fiber neuropathy (SFN) after COVID-19 treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment.

MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment.

ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS.

DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEpstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection of B cells is now understood to be one of the triggering events for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a progressive immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. EBV infection is also linked to expression of Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of the HERV-W group, a further risk factor for the development of MS (Ocrelizumab is a high-potency disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for MS, which depletes B cells by targeting CD20.

ObjectivesWe studied the effects of ocrelizumab on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from paired samples from 20 patients taken prior to and 6 months after beginning Ocrelizumab therapy. We hypothesised that EBV and HERV-W loads would be lower in post-treatment samples.

MethodsSamples were collected in Paxgene tubes, subject to RNA extraction and Illumina paired end short read mRNA sequencing with mapping of sequence reads to the human genome using Salmon and Differential Gene expression compared with DeSeq2. Mapping was also performed separately to the HERV-D database of HERV sequences and the EBV reference sequence.

ResultsPatient samples were more strongly clustered by individual rather than disease type (relapsing/remitting or primary progressive), treatment (pre and post), age, or sex. Fourteen genes, all clearly linked to B cell function were significantly down regulated in the post treatment samples. Interestingly only one pre-treatment sample had detectable EBV RNA and there were no significant differences in HERV expression (of any group) between pre- and post-treatment samples.

ConclusionsWhile EBV and HERV expression are clearly linked to triggering MS pathogenesis, it does not appear that high level expression of these viruses is a part of the ongoing disease process or that changes in virus load are associated with Ocrelizumab treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionOften, isolated clinical event suggestive of CNS demyelination confers a risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigate lymphocyte profiles after a first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), which could contribute to the current understanding of early inflammatory responses in this demyelinating disease.

MethodsTwenty treatment-naive clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and fifteen healthy participants were included in our assessment of lymphocyte profiles and B cell subsets using multicolour flow cytometry. Analysis was made at 3-6 months (Baseline), 12, and 24 months after a first clinical event. We also performed a sub-analysis of patients that received glatiramer acetate (GLAT) after their baseline visit up to 24 months after the first clinical event.

ResultsOur analysis revealed monocyte and B cell differences between groups. Percentages of CD19&#43;CD20&#43; B cells were lower in CIS patients compared to healthy individuals at baseline. Additionally, monocyte distribution among groups was different.

A subgroup analysis of patients treated with GLAT (n= 10) showed an increased percentage of naive (p&lt;0.05) and memory pre-switched (p&lt;0.01) B cells up to 24 months after their baseline visit compared to the untreated group (n= 10).

ConclusionOur results showed early monocyte and B cell subsets alterations in pwCIS. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of B cells and monocyte disturbances during inflammatory processes after a first clinically-MS suggestive event.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The current demand for early intervention, prevention, and treatment of late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) warrants deeper understanding of the underlying molecular processes which could contribute to biomarker and drug target discovery. Utilizing high-throughput proteomic measurements in serum from a prospective population-based cohort of older adults (n=5,294), we identified 303 unique proteins associated with incident LOAD (median follow-up 12.8 years). Over 40% of these proteins were associated with LOAD independently of APOE-{varepsilon}4 carrier status. These proteins were implicated in neuronal processes and overlapped with protein signatures of LOAD in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We found 17 proteins which LOAD-association was strongly dependent on APOE-{varepsilon}4 carrier status. Most of them showed consistent associations with LOAD in cerebrospinal fluid and a third had brain-specific gene expression. Remarkably, four proteins in this group (TBCA, ARL2, S100A13 and IRF6) were downregulated by APOE-{varepsilon}4 yet upregulated as a consequence of LOAD as determined in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, reflecting a potential response to the disease onset. Accordingly, the direct association of these proteins to LOAD was reversed upon APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype adjustment, a finding which we replicate in an external cohort (n=719). Our findings provide an insight into the dysregulated pathways that may lead to the development and early detection of LOAD, including those both independent and dependent on APOE-{varepsilon}4. Importantly, many of the LOAD-associated proteins we find in the circulation have been found to be expressed - and have a direct link with AD - in brain tissue. Thus, the proteins identified here, and their upstream modulating pathways, provide a new source of circulating biomarker and therapeutic target candidates for LOAD.</p>
