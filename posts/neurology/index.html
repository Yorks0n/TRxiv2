We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

S.; Wairagkar, M.; Iaccobacci, C.; Hou, X.; Singer-Clark, T.; Willett, F. R.; Kunz, E. M.; Fan, C.; Vahdati Nia, M.; Deo, D. R.; Choi, E. Y.; Glasser, M. F.; Hochberg, L. R.; Henderson, J. M.; Shahlaie, K.; Brandman, D. M.; Stavisky, S. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23300110\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a rapid, intuitive way for people with paralysis to communicate by transforming the cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text. Despite recent advances, communication with BCIs has been restricted by requiring many weeks of training data, and by inadequate decoding accuracy. Here we report a speech BCI that decodes neural activity from 256 microelectrodes in the left precentral gyrus of a person with ALS and severe dysarthria. This system achieves daily word error rates as low as 1% (2.66% average; 9 times fewer errors than previous state-of-the-art speech BCIs) using a comprehensive 125,000-word vocabulary. On the first day of system use, following only 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the BCI achieved 99.6% word accuracy with a 50 word vocabulary. On the second day of use, we increased the vocabulary size to 125,000 words and after an additional 1.4 hours of training data, the BCI achieved 90.2% word accuracy. At the beginning of subsequent days of use, the BCI reliably achieved 95% word accuracy, and adaptive online fine-tuning continuously improved this accuracy throughout the day. Our participant used the speech BCI in self-paced conversation for over 32 hours to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues (both in-person and over video chat). These results indicate that speech BCIs have reached a level of performance suitable to restore naturalistic communication to people living with severe dysarthria.\nUsing Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech\nAuthors: Rezaii, N.; Quimby, M.; Wong, B.; Hochberg, D.; Brickhouse, M.; Touroutoglou, A.; Dickerson, B. C.; Wolff, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300470\nNeurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy. One sentence summaryComputational linguistic analyses of naturalistic speech samples can classify the aphasic variant of patients similarly to expert clinicians and identify well-established and novel linguistic features crucial for classification.\nPrognostic biomarkers of intracerebral hemorrhage identified using targeted proteomics and machine learning algorithms\nAuthors: Misra, S.; Kawamura, Y.; Singh, P.; Sengupta, S.; Nath, M.; Rahman, Z.; Kumar, P.; Kumar, A.; Aggarwal, P.; Srivastava, A. K.; Pandit, A. K.; Mohania, D.; Prasad, K.; Mishra, N. K.; Vibha, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300465\nEarly prognostication of patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is critical for patient care. We aim to investigate protein biomarkers role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N=150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3-6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (aOR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41-35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.57; 1.26-24.59), and Serpin-A11 (9.33; 1.09-79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (6.32; 1.82-21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 1.24-3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (1.98; 1.19-3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Using machine learning, UCH-L1 and APO-C1 predicted 90-day mortality, and UCH-L1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 predicted 180-day mortality. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multiomics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis.\nPlasma neurofilament light chain is elevated in Niemann-Pick Type C but glial fibrillary acidic protein is not\nAuthors: Eratne, D.; Lewis, C.; Loi, S. M.; Chiu, W.-H.; Blennow, K. M.; Zetterberg, H.; Santillo, A. F.; Velakoulis, D.; Walterfang, M.; The MiND Study Group, Score: 3.8, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299884\nOBJECTIVENiemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls. METHODSPatients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges. RESULTSPlasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p\u003c0.001), and reference ranges (all \u003e98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL). DISCUSSIONThe study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.\nPrecision Brain Morphometry Using Cluster Scanning\nAuthors: Elliott, M. L.; Nielsen, J.; Hanford, L.; Hamadeh, A.; Hilbert, T.; Kober, T.; Dickerson, B. C.; Hyman, B.; Mair, R.; Eldaief, M.; Buckner, R. L.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.23300492\nMeasurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans ([~]1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as \"cluster scanning.\" Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.\nPathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis: Genetic, Environmental, and Random Mechanisms\nAuthors: Goodin, D. S. S.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.23300524\nBACKGROUNDMS-pathogenesis requires both genetic factors and environmental events. The question remains, however, whether these factors and events completely describe the MS disease-process. This question was addressed using the Canadian MS-data, which includes 29,478 individuals, representing 65-83% of all Canadian MS-patients. METHODSThe \"genetically-susceptible\" subset of the population, (G), includes everyone who has any non-zero life-time chance of developing MS, under some environmental-conditions. A \"sufficient\" environmental-exposure, for any \"genetically-susceptible\" individual, includes every set of environmental conditions, each of which is sufficient, by itself, to cause MS in that person. This analysis incorporates several different epidemiologic-parameters, involved in MS-pathogenesis, only some of which are directly-observable, and establishes \"plausible-value-ranges\" for each parameter. Those parameter-value combinations (solutions) that fall within these plausible-ranges are then determined. RESULTSOnly a fraction of the population can possibly be \"genetically-susceptible\". Thus, many individuals have no possibility of developing MS under any environmental conditions. Moreover, some \"genetically-susceptible\" individuals, despite their experiencing a \"sufficient\" environmental-exposure, will never develop disease. CONCLUSIONSThis analysis explicitly includes all of those genetic factors and environmental events (including interactions), which are necessary for MS-pathogenesis, regardless of whether these are known, suspected, or as yet unrecognized. Nevertheless, in addition, \"true\" randomness seems to play a critical role in disease-pathogenesis. This observation provides empirical evidence that undermines the widely-held deterministic view of nature. Moreover, both sexes seem to have a similar genetic and environmental disease-basis. If so, this indicates that this random element is primarily responsible for the currently-observed differences in disease-expression between susceptible-women and susceptible-men.\nAlterations in gamma frequency oscillations correlate with cortical tau deposition in Alzheimer disease\nAuthors: Nencha, U.; Rigoni, I.; Ribaldi, F.; Altomare, D.; Seeck, M.; Garibotto, V.; Vulliemoz, S.; Frisoni, G.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300275\nWe assessed the relationship of gamma oscillations with tau deposition in Alzheimers disease (AD) and other cognitive diseases, as both are altered during the disease course and relate to neurodegeneration. We retrospectively analyzed data from 7 AD, tau positive patients and 9 tau negative patients, that underwent amyloid PET, and cerebral tau PET and EEG within 12 months. Relative gamma power was higher in tau positive (AD) patients than in tau negative patients (p\u003c.05) and tau burden was associated with a linear increase in gamma power (p\u003c.001), while no association was present with amyloid-{beta} burden. Thus, increase in the gamma power might represent a novel biomarker for tau driven neurodegeneration.\n",

        <p class="abstract">PurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities.

MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded.

Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers.

ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

        <p class="abstract">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a rapid, intuitive way for people with paralysis to communicate by transforming the cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text. Despite recent advances, communication with BCIs has been restricted by requiring many weeks of training data, and by inadequate decoding accuracy. Here we report a speech BCI that decodes neural activity from 256 microelectrodes in the left precentral gyrus of a person with ALS and severe dysarthria. This system achieves daily word error rates as low as 1% (2.66% average; 9 times fewer errors than previous state-of-the-art speech BCIs) using a comprehensive 125,000-word vocabulary. On the first day of system use, following only 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the BCI achieved 99.6% word accuracy with a 50 word vocabulary. On the second day of use, we increased the vocabulary size to 125,000 words and after an additional 1.4 hours of training data, the BCI achieved 90.2% word accuracy. At the beginning of subsequent days of use, the BCI reliably achieved 95% word accuracy, and adaptive online fine-tuning continuously improved this accuracy throughout the day. Our participant used the speech BCI in self-paced conversation for over 32 hours to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues (both in-person and over video chat). These results indicate that speech BCIs have reached a level of performance suitable to restore naturalistic communication to people living with severe dysarthria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.

One sentence summaryComputational linguistic analyses of naturalistic speech samples can classify the aphasic variant of patients similarly to expert clinicians and identify well-established and novel linguistic features crucial for classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early prognostication of patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is critical for patient care. We aim to investigate protein biomarkers role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N=150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3-6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (aOR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41-35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.57; 1.26-24.59), and Serpin-A11 (9.33; 1.09-79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (6.32; 1.82-21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 1.24-3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (1.98; 1.19-3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Using machine learning, UCH-L1 and APO-C1 predicted 90-day mortality, and UCH-L1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 predicted 180-day mortality. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multiomics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVENiemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a genetic neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder commonly associated with psychiatric symptoms and delays to accurate diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls.

METHODSPatients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using genralised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges.

RESULTSPlasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1pg/mL vs 7.4pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), and reference ranges (all &gt;98th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6pg/mL vs 75.1pg/mL).

DISCUSSIONThe study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Measurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans ([~]1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as &#34;cluster scanning.&#34; Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDMS-pathogenesis requires both genetic factors and environmental events. The question remains, however, whether these factors and events completely describe the MS disease-process. This question was addressed using the Canadian MS-data, which includes 29,478 individuals, representing 65-83% of all Canadian MS-patients.

METHODSThe &#34;genetically-susceptible&#34; subset of the population, (G), includes everyone who has any non-zero life-time chance of developing MS, under some environmental-conditions. A &#34;sufficient&#34; environmental-exposure, for any &#34;genetically-susceptible&#34; individual, includes every set of environmental conditions, each of which is sufficient, by itself, to cause MS in that person. This analysis incorporates several different epidemiologic-parameters, involved in MS-pathogenesis, only some of which are directly-observable, and establishes &#34;plausible-value-ranges&#34; for each parameter. Those parameter-value combinations (solutions) that fall within these plausible-ranges are then determined.

RESULTSOnly a fraction of the population can possibly be &#34;genetically-susceptible&#34;. Thus, many individuals have no possibility of developing MS under any environmental conditions. Moreover, some &#34;genetically-susceptible&#34; individuals, despite their experiencing a &#34;sufficient&#34; environmental-exposure, will never develop disease.

CONCLUSIONSThis analysis explicitly includes all of those genetic factors and environmental events (including interactions), which are necessary for MS-pathogenesis, regardless of whether these are known, suspected, or as yet unrecognized. Nevertheless, in addition, &#34;true&#34; randomness seems to play a critical role in disease-pathogenesis. This observation provides empirical evidence that undermines the widely-held deterministic view of nature. Moreover, both sexes seem to have a similar genetic and environmental disease-basis. If so, this indicates that this random element is primarily responsible for the currently-observed differences in disease-expression between susceptible-women and susceptible-men.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We assessed the relationship of gamma oscillations with tau deposition in Alzheimers disease (AD) and other cognitive diseases, as both are altered during the disease course and relate to neurodegeneration. We retrospectively analyzed data from 7 AD, tau positive patients and 9 tau negative patients, that underwent amyloid PET, and cerebral tau PET and EEG within 12 months. Relative gamma power was higher in tau positive (AD) patients than in tau negative patients (p&lt;.05) and tau burden was associated with a linear increase in gamma power (p&lt;.001), while no association was present with amyloid-{beta} burden. Thus, increase in the gamma power might represent a novel biomarker for tau driven neurodegeneration.</p>
