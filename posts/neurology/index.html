D.; Saad, Z.; Triana-Baltzer, G.; Laws, S. M.; Shishegar, R.; Huang, K.; Fowler, C.; Ward, L.; Masters, C. L.; Mejan-Fripp, J.; Kolb, H. C.; Villemagne, V. L.; Rowe, C. C.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301180\nBackgroundPlasma phospho-tau biomarkers, such as p217+tau, excel at identifying Alzheimers Disease (AD) neuropathology. However, questions remain regarding their capacity to inform AD biological PET stages at group level and maintain the same precision at individual patient level. MethodParticipants included 248 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 227 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, with Janssen plasma p217+tau Simoa(R) assay, 18F-NAV4694 A{beta} PET (A) and 18F-MK6240 tau PET (T) data. Biological PET stages were defined based on the draft NIA-AA Revised Criteria (July 2023): Initial (A+T-), Early (A+TMTL+), Intermediate (A+TMOD+), and Advanced (A+THIGH+). We used thresholds for A+ of 25 Centiloid and for THIGH of 80 Centaur (2.68 SUVRtemporo-parietal). Adding an A-T- stage for comparison, we assessed the performance of p217+tau in discriminating between these stages at the group level using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and at the individual level using logistic regression. ResultsPlasma p217+tau concentrations increased across the stages, with significant differences between them, except for the Initial and Early stages. Screening for Advanced (vs. lower stages), combined Intermediate/Advanced (vs. lower stages), or all stages (vs. A-T-), p217+tau showed good group-level discriminations (AUC 0.91, 0.92 and 0.92; CI only: AUC 0.83, 0.89, 0.93, respectively). At the individual level, the likelihood of PET stage vs. p217+tau level showed good discrimination of A-T- vs any A+ stage and of combined Intermediate/Advanced disease stage vs lower stages in the CI. ConclusionIn addition to accurately screening for A+ individuals, plasma p217+tau shows promise for separating persons with either Intermediate or Advanced stage AD from those at a lower stage, providing prognostic information and informing better selection for trials and disease modifying therapies.\nFunctional connectivity of stimulus-evoked brain responses to natural speech in post-stroke aphasia.\nAuthors: Mehraram, R.; De Clercq, P.; Kries, J.; Vandermosten, M.; Francart, T.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.24301324\nOne out of three stroke-patients develop language processing impairment known as aphasia. The need for ecological validity of the existing diagnostic tools motivates research on biomarkers, such as stimulus-evoked brain responses. With the aim of enhancing the physiological interpretation of the latter, we used EEG to investigate how functional brain network patterns associated with the neural response to natural speech are affected in persons with post-stroke chronic aphasia. EEG was recorded from 24 healthy controls and 40 persons with aphasia while they listened to a story. Stimulus-evoked brain responses at all scalp regions were measured as neural envelope tracking in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and low-gamma bands (30-49 Hz) using mutual information. Functional connectivity between neural-tracking signals was measured, and the Network-Based Statistics toolbox was used to: 1) assess the added value of the neural tracking vs EEG time series, 2) test between-group differences and 3) investigate any association with language performance in aphasia. Graph theory was also used to investigate topological alterations in aphasia. Functional connectivity was higher when assessed from neural tracking compared to EEG time series. Persons with aphasia showed weaker low-gamma-band left-hemispheric connectivity, and graph theory-based results showed a greater network segregation and higher region-specific node strength. Aphasia also exhibited a correlation between delta-band connectivity within the left pre-frontal region and language performance. We demonstrated the added value of neural tracking when investigating functional brain networks associated with natural speech processing in post-stroke aphasia. Its higher sensitivity to language-related brain circuits favors its use as informative biomarker for the assessment of aphasia.\nThe use of continuous brain parenchymal impedance dispersion to measure glymphatic function in humans\nAuthors: Dagum, P.; Giovangrandi, L.; Levendovszky, S. R.; Winebaum, J. J.; Singh, T.; Cho, Y.; Kaplan, R. M.; Jaffe, M. S.; Lim, M. M.; Vandeweerd, C.; Iliff, J. J.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.24300933\nGlymphatic function in animal models supports the clearance of brain proteins whose mis-aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. The measurement of glymphatic function in the human brain has been elusive, limiting its potential in translational research. Here we described a non-invasive multimodal device for the first-in-human continuous measurement of glymphatic function using repeated electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Through two separate clinical validation studies, the device captured sleep-active glymphatic function. Device measurements successfully (i) paralleled sleep-associated changes in extracellular volume that regulate glymphatic exchange, (ii) replicated preclinical findings showing glymphatic function is increased with increasing sleep EEG delta power, and is decreased with increasing sleep EEG beta power and heart rate, and (iii) predicted glymphatic solute exchange measured by contrast enhanced MRI. The present investigational device permits the continuous and time-resolved assessment of glymphatic function in naturalistic settings necessary to determine the contribution of glymphatic impairment to risk and progression of Alzheimers disease, and to enable target-engagement studies that modulate glymphatic function in humans.\nQuantifying morphological changes in middle trapezius with ultrasound scanning and a novel histogram-matching algorithm for adults with and without Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD).\nAuthors: Philp, F.; Meilak, E.; Seyres, M.; Willis, T.; Winn, N.; Pandyan, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301162\nBackground and ObjectivesFacioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease causing changes in muscle structure that can negatively affect upper-limb function. Echogenicity, measured using quantified muscle ultrasound, is a potential biomarker that could be used for informing decision making. Histogram-matching allows for image normalisation, which could enable comparison of echogenicity between different machine capture settings which is a current limitation. This study aimed to investigate if ultrasonography and histogram-matching can measure trapezius muscle echogenicity and morphology for differentiating between people with and without FSHD, and different levels of arm function. MethodsSingle measurement timepoint case control study of adults with FSHD and age- and sex-matched controls. Main outcomes were trapezius echogenicity and muscle thickness measured using 2D-ultrasound, and maximum thoracohumeral elevation angle, measured using 3D-movement analysis. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the effect of histogram-matching and different reference images was conducted. Between group differences for echogenicity were evaluated using an unpaired student t-test. Echogenicity, muscle thickness and range of movement were plotted to evaluate the explained variance between variables. ResultsData was collected for 14 participants (10M:4F), seven with FSHD and seven controls with a mean (SD) age of 41.6 (15.7). Normalisation was necessary and echogenicity values for the FSHD group were higher than the controls (118.2 (34.0) vs 42.3 (14.0) respectively, with statistically significant differences (p=0.002). An overall variance of 6.2 (LLOA -2.9 to ULOA 15.4) was identified between reference images. Echogenicity accounted for the largest explained variance in muscle thickness (R2=0.81) and range of movement (R2=0.74), whilst muscle thickness and range of movement was the lowest (R2=0.61). DiscussionPeople with FSHD demonstrated higher echogenicity, smaller muscle thicknesses and less range of movement. Histogram-matching for comparison of echogenicity values is necessary and can provide quantifiable differences. Different reference images affect echogenicity values but the variability is less than between group differences. Further work is needed to evaluate the longitudinal variability associated with this method on a larger sample of people with varying levels of arm function. Ultrasound scanning and post-histogram matching may be used to quantify and compare differences in muscle structure and function people with and without FSHD.\nLoss of Function of the Cytoplasmic Fe-S Assembly Protein CIAO1 Causes a Neuromuscular Disorder with Compromise of Nucleocytoplasmic Fe-S Enzymes\nAuthors: Maio, N.; Orbach, R.; Zaharieva, I.; Töpf, A.; Donkervoort, S.; Munot, P.; Mueller, J.; Willis, T.; Verma, S.; Peric, S.; Krishnakumar, D.; Sudhakar, S.; Foley, A.

G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300170\nCytoplasmic and nuclear iron-sulfur enzymes that are essential for genome maintenance and replication depend on the cytoplasmic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery for cluster acquisition. Here we report that patients with biallelic loss of function in CIAO1, a key CIA component, develop proximal and axial muscle weakness, fluctuating creatine kinase elevation and respiratory insufficiency. In addition, they present with CNS symptoms including learning difficulties and neurobehavioral comorbidities, along with iron deposition in deep brain nuclei, macrocytic anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Mutational analysis and functional assays revealed reduced stability of the variants compared to wild-type CIAO1. Loss of CIAO1 impaired DNA helicases, polymerases and repair enzymes which rely on the CIA complex to acquire their Fe-S cofactors, with lentiviral restoration reversing all patient-derived cellular abnormalities. Our study identifies CIAO1 as a novel human disease gene and provides insights into the broader implications of the iron-sulfur assembly pathway in human health and disease.

R.; Meppelink, A. M.; Ghosh, A.; Thijs, R. D.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.23300494\nNeurobehavioural comorbidities have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of people with epilepsy, yet tracking their impact is challenging as behaviour may vary with seizures and anti-seizure medication side effects. Smartphones have the potential to monitor day-to-day neurobehavioural patterns objectively. We present the case of a man in his late twenties with refractory focal epilepsy in whom we ascertained the effects of ASMs withdrawal and a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic convulsion on his touchscreen interactions. Using a dedicated app, we recorded over 185 days, the timestamps of 718,357 interactions. We divided the various smartphone behaviours according to the next-interval dynamics of the interactions by using a joint interval distribution (JID). We analysed JIDs during two ASM load transitions: before versus during tapering and restarting medication versus tapering. Cluster-based permutation testing revealed significant differences, with accelerated next-interval dynamics during tapering and a reversal upon medication restart. We also compared the JID of the fbTCS day to the average of the three days before, showing markedly slower next-interval dynamics on the day of the convulsion. This suggests that smartphone interactions temporal dynamics may help monitor neurobehavioural comorbidities in epilepsy.\nBiomarker changes preceding symptom onset in genetic prion disease\nAuthors: Vallabh, S. M.; Mortberg, M. A.; Allen, S. W.; Kupferschmid, A. C.; Kivisakk, P.; Hammerschlag, B. L.; Bolling, A.; Trombetta, B. A.; Devitte-McKee, K.; Ford, A. M.; Sather, L.; Duffy, G.; Rivera, A.; Gerber, J.; McManus, A. J.; Minikel, E. V.; Arnold, S. E.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300042\nImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset. ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls. Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study. Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma. ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints. Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset? FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.\nPrevalence of orthostatic intolerance in Long Covid clinic patients - A multicentre observational study\nAuthors: Lee, C.; Greenwood, D.; Master, H.; Balasundaram, K.; Williams, P.; Scott, J.; Wood, C.; Cooper, R.; Darbyshire, J.; Espinosa Gonzalez, A.; Davies, H.; Osborne, T.; Corrado, J.; Iftekhar, N.; Rogers, N.; Delaney, B. C.; Greenhalgh, T.; Sivan, M.; LOCOMOTION Consortium, Score: 31.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23299958\nPurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

Here, we aimed to characterize early CSF proteome changes in ADAD and leverage them as potential biomarkers for disease monitoring and therapeutic strategies. MethodsWe utilized Somascan(R) 7K assay to quantify protein levels in the CSF from 291 mutation carriers (MCs) and 185 non-carriers (NCs). We employed a multi-layer regression model to identify proteins with different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. We replicated the results using publicly available ADAD datasets as well as proteomic data from sporadic Alzheimers disease (sAD). To biologically contextualize the results, we performed network and pathway enrichment analyses. Machine learning was applied to create and validate predictive models. FindingsWe identified 125 proteins with significantly different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. Twelve proteins showed changes even before the traditional AD biomarkers (A{beta}42, tau, ptau). These 125 proteins belong to three different modules that are associated with age at onset: 1) early stage module associated with stress response, glutamate metabolism, and mitochondria damage; 2) the middle stage module, enriched in neuronal death and apoptosis; and 3) the presymptomatic stage module was characterized by changes in microglia, and cell-to-cell communication processes, indicating an attempt of rebuilding and establishing new connections to maintain functionality. Machine learning identified a subset of nine proteins that can differentiate MCs from NCs better than traditional AD biomarkers (AUC\u003e0.89). InterpretationOur findings comprehensively described early proteomic changes associated with ADAD and captured specific biological processes that happen in the early phases of the disease, fifteen to five years before clinical onset. We identified a small subset of proteins with the potentials to become therapy-monitoring biomarkers of ADAD MCs. FundingProteomic data generation was supported by NIH: RF1AG044546\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPlasma phospho-tau biomarkers, such as p217&#43;tau, excel at identifying Alzheimers Disease (AD) neuropathology. However, questions remain regarding their capacity to inform AD biological PET stages at group level and maintain the same precision at individual patient level.

MethodParticipants included 248 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 227 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, with Janssen plasma p217&#43;tau Simoa(R) assay, 18F-NAV4694 A{beta} PET (A) and 18F-MK6240 tau PET (T) data. Biological PET stages were defined based on the draft NIA-AA Revised Criteria (July 2023): Initial (A&#43;T-), Early (A&#43;TMTL&#43;), Intermediate (A&#43;TMOD&#43;), and Advanced (A&#43;THIGH&#43;). We used thresholds for A&#43; of 25 Centiloid and for THIGH of 80 Centaur (2.68 SUVRtemporo-parietal). Adding an A-T- stage for comparison, we assessed the performance of p217&#43;tau in discriminating between these stages at the group level using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and at the individual level using logistic regression.

ResultsPlasma p217&#43;tau concentrations increased across the stages, with significant differences between them, except for the Initial and Early stages. Screening for Advanced (vs. lower stages), combined Intermediate/Advanced (vs. lower stages), or all stages (vs. A-T-), p217&#43;tau showed good group-level discriminations (AUC 0.91, 0.92 and 0.92; CI only: AUC 0.83, 0.89, 0.93, respectively). At the individual level, the likelihood of PET stage vs. p217&#43;tau level showed good discrimination of A-T- vs any A&#43; stage and of combined Intermediate/Advanced disease stage vs lower stages in the CI.

ConclusionIn addition to accurately screening for A&#43; individuals, plasma p217&#43;tau shows promise for separating persons with either Intermediate or Advanced stage AD from those at a lower stage, providing prognostic information and informing better selection for trials and disease modifying therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One out of three stroke-patients develop language processing impairment known as aphasia. The need for ecological validity of the existing diagnostic tools motivates research on biomarkers, such as stimulus-evoked brain responses. With the aim of enhancing the physiological interpretation of the latter, we used EEG to investigate how functional brain network patterns associated with the neural response to natural speech are affected in persons with post-stroke chronic aphasia. EEG was recorded from 24 healthy controls and 40 persons with aphasia while they listened to a story. Stimulus-evoked brain responses at all scalp regions were measured as neural envelope tracking in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and low-gamma bands (30-49 Hz) using mutual information. Functional connectivity between neural-tracking signals was measured, and the Network-Based Statistics toolbox was used to: 1) assess the added value of the neural tracking vs EEG time series, 2) test between-group differences and 3) investigate any association with language performance in aphasia. Graph theory was also used to investigate topological alterations in aphasia. Functional connectivity was higher when assessed from neural tracking compared to EEG time series. Persons with aphasia showed weaker low-gamma-band left-hemispheric connectivity, and graph theory-based results showed a greater network segregation and higher region-specific node strength. Aphasia also exhibited a correlation between delta-band connectivity within the left pre-frontal region and language performance. We demonstrated the added value of neural tracking when investigating functional brain networks associated with natural speech processing in post-stroke aphasia. Its higher sensitivity to language-related brain circuits favors its use as informative biomarker for the assessment of aphasia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glymphatic function in animal models supports the clearance of brain proteins whose mis-aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. The measurement of glymphatic function in the human brain has been elusive, limiting its potential in translational research. Here we described a non-invasive multimodal device for the first-in-human continuous measurement of glymphatic function using repeated electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Through two separate clinical validation studies, the device captured sleep-active glymphatic function. Device measurements successfully (i) paralleled sleep-associated changes in extracellular volume that regulate glymphatic exchange, (ii) replicated preclinical findings showing glymphatic function is increased with increasing sleep EEG delta power, and is decreased with increasing sleep EEG beta power and heart rate, and (iii) predicted glymphatic solute exchange measured by contrast enhanced MRI. The present investigational device permits the continuous and time-resolved assessment of glymphatic function in naturalistic settings necessary to determine the contribution of glymphatic impairment to risk and progression of Alzheimers disease, and to enable target-engagement studies that modulate glymphatic function in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectivesFacioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease causing changes in muscle structure that can negatively affect upper-limb function. Echogenicity, measured using quantified muscle ultrasound, is a potential biomarker that could be used for informing decision making. Histogram-matching allows for image normalisation, which could enable comparison of echogenicity between different machine capture settings which is a current limitation. This study aimed to investigate if ultrasonography and histogram-matching can measure trapezius muscle echogenicity and morphology for differentiating between people with and without FSHD, and different levels of arm function.

MethodsSingle measurement timepoint case control study of adults with FSHD and age- and sex-matched controls. Main outcomes were trapezius echogenicity and muscle thickness measured using 2D-ultrasound, and maximum thoracohumeral elevation angle, measured using 3D-movement analysis. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the effect of histogram-matching and different reference images was conducted. Between group differences for echogenicity were evaluated using an unpaired student t-test. Echogenicity, muscle thickness and range of movement were plotted to evaluate the explained variance between variables.

ResultsData was collected for 14 participants (10M:4F), seven with FSHD and seven controls with a mean (SD) age of 41.6 (15.7). Normalisation was necessary and echogenicity values for the FSHD group were higher than the controls (118.2 (34.0) vs 42.3 (14.0) respectively, with statistically significant differences (p=0.002). An overall variance of 6.2 (LLOA -2.9 to ULOA 15.4) was identified between reference images. Echogenicity accounted for the largest explained variance in muscle thickness (R2=0.81) and range of movement (R2=0.74), whilst muscle thickness and range of movement was the lowest (R2=0.61).

DiscussionPeople with FSHD demonstrated higher echogenicity, smaller muscle thicknesses and less range of movement. Histogram-matching for comparison of echogenicity values is necessary and can provide quantifiable differences. Different reference images affect echogenicity values but the variability is less than between group differences. Further work is needed to evaluate the longitudinal variability associated with this method on a larger sample of people with varying levels of arm function. Ultrasound scanning and post-histogram matching may be used to quantify and compare differences in muscle structure and function people with and without FSHD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytoplasmic and nuclear iron-sulfur enzymes that are essential for genome maintenance and replication depend on the cytoplasmic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery for cluster acquisition. Here we report that patients with biallelic loss of function in CIAO1, a key CIA component, develop proximal and axial muscle weakness, fluctuating creatine kinase elevation and respiratory insufficiency. In addition, they present with CNS symptoms including learning difficulties and neurobehavioral comorbidities, along with iron deposition in deep brain nuclei, macrocytic anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Mutational analysis and functional assays revealed reduced stability of the variants compared to wild-type CIAO1. Loss of CIAO1 impaired DNA helicases, polymerases and repair enzymes which rely on the CIA complex to acquire their Fe-S cofactors, with lentiviral restoration reversing all patient-derived cellular abnormalities. Our study identifies CIAO1 as a novel human disease gene and provides insights into the broader implications of the iron-sulfur assembly pathway in human health and disease.

        <p class="abstract">Neurobehavioural comorbidities have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of people with epilepsy, yet tracking their impact is challenging as behaviour may vary with seizures and anti-seizure medication side effects. Smartphones have the potential to monitor day-to-day neurobehavioural patterns objectively. We present the case of a man in his late twenties with refractory focal epilepsy in whom we ascertained the effects of ASMs withdrawal and a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic convulsion on his touchscreen interactions. Using a dedicated app, we recorded over 185 days, the timestamps of 718,357 interactions. We divided the various smartphone behaviours according to the next-interval dynamics of the interactions by using a joint interval distribution (JID). We analysed JIDs during two ASM load transitions: before versus during tapering and restarting medication versus tapering. Cluster-based permutation testing revealed significant differences, with accelerated next-interval dynamics during tapering and a reversal upon medication restart. We also compared the JID of the fbTCS day to the average of the three days before, showing markedly slower next-interval dynamics on the day of the convulsion. This suggests that smartphone interactions temporal dynamics may help monitor neurobehavioural comorbidities in epilepsy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset.

ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls.

Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study.

Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma.

ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints.

Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities.

MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded.

Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers.

ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTo date, there is no high throughput proteomic study in the context of Autosomal Dominant Alzheimers disease (ADAD). Here, we aimed to characterize early CSF proteome changes in ADAD and leverage them as potential biomarkers for disease monitoring and therapeutic strategies.

MethodsWe utilized Somascan(R) 7K assay to quantify protein levels in the CSF from 291 mutation carriers (MCs) and 185 non-carriers (NCs). We employed a multi-layer regression model to identify proteins with different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. We replicated the results using publicly available ADAD datasets as well as proteomic data from sporadic Alzheimers disease (sAD). To biologically contextualize the results, we performed network and pathway enrichment analyses. Machine learning was applied to create and validate predictive models.

FindingsWe identified 125 proteins with significantly different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. Twelve proteins showed changes even before the traditional AD biomarkers (A{beta}42, tau, ptau). These 125 proteins belong to three different modules that are associated with age at onset: 1) early stage module associated with stress response, glutamate metabolism, and mitochondria damage; 2) the middle stage module, enriched in neuronal death and apoptosis; and 3) the presymptomatic stage module was characterized by changes in microglia, and cell-to-cell communication processes, indicating an attempt of rebuilding and establishing new connections to maintain functionality. Machine learning identified a subset of nine proteins that can differentiate MCs from NCs better than traditional AD biomarkers (AUC&gt;0.89).

InterpretationOur findings comprehensively described early proteomic changes associated with ADAD and captured specific biological processes that happen in the early phases of the disease, fifteen to five years before clinical onset. We identified a small subset of proteins with the potentials to become therapy-monitoring biomarkers of ADAD MCs.
