T.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.23298314\nLimbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.\nA systematic review of quantitative EEG findings in Long COVID, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nAuthors: Silva-Passadouro, B.; Tamasauskas, A.; Khoja, O.; Casson, A. J.; Delis, I.; Brown, C.; Sivan, M.\nScore: 43.8, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298171\nLong COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.\nBrain-derived Tau for Monitoring Brain Injury in Acute Ischemic Stroke\nAuthors: Vlegels, N.; Gonzalez-Ortiz, F.; Knuth, N. L.; Khalifeh, N.; Gesierich, B.; Mueller, F.; Mueller, P.; Klein, M.; Dimitriadis, K.; Franzmeier, N.; Liebig, T.; Duering, M.; Reidler, P.; Dichgans, M.; Karikari, T. K.; Blennow, K.; Tiedt, S.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-11-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.23298728\nThe evolution of infarcts varies widely among patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and influences treatment decisions. Neuroimaging is not applicable for frequent monitoring and there is no blood-based biomarker to track ongoing brain injury in acute IS. Here, we examined the utility of plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) as a biomarker for brain injury in acute IS. We conducted the prospective, observational Precision Medicine in Stroke [PROMISE] study with serial blood sampling upon hospital admission and at days 2, 3, and 7 in patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and for comparison, in patients with stroke mimics (SM). We determined the temporal course of plasma BD-tau, its relation to infarct size and admission imaging-based metrics of brain injury, and its value to predict functional outcome. Upon admission (median time-from-onset, 4.4h), BD-tau levels in IS patients correlated with ASPECTS ({rho}=-0.21, P\u003c.0001) and were predictive of final infarct volume ({rho}=0.26, P\u003c.0001). In contrast to SM patients, BD-tau levels in IS patients increased from admission (median, 2.9 pg/ml [IQR, 1.8-4.8]) to day 2 (median time-from-onset, 22.7h; median BD-tau, 5.0 pg/ml [IQR, 2.6-10.3]; P\u003c.0001). The rate of change of BD-tau from admission to day 2 was significantly associated with collateral supply (R2=0.10, P\u003c.0001) and infarct progression ({rho}=0.58, P\u003c.0001). At day 2, BD-tau was predictive of final infarct volume ({rho}=0.59, P\u003c.0001) and showed superior value for predicting the 90-day mRS score compared with final infarct volume. In conclusion, in 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome. Further research is needed to determine whether BD-tau assessments can inform decision-making in stroke care.\nMapping the Interplay of Atrial Fibrillation, Brain Structure and Cognitive Dysfunction\nAuthors: Petersen, M.; Chevalier, C.; Naegele, F. L.; Ingwersen, T.; Omidvarnia, A.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Patil, K.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Schnabel, R. B.; Kirchhof, P.; Schlemm, E.; Cheng, B.; Thomalla, G.; Jensen, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298431\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The investigation of the cognitive sequelae and alterations of brain structure linked to AF is crucial to help address ensuing health care needs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging analysis of 1335 stroke-free individuals with AF (30% women, average age 69.1 years) and compared them with 2683 demographically and cardiovascular risk-matched controls (31% women, average age 69.1 years). Primary study outcomes were neuropsychological test scores and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of gray matter morphology, gray and white matter microstructure, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load. Our analysis identified deficits in attention/executive function, information processing speed and reasoning in individuals with AF. These cognitive impairments were accompanied by a complex imaging profile suggestive of small vessel pathology: (1) reduced cortical thickness and gray matter volume in areas including primary motor, somatosensory and visual cortices as well as the orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and temporal cortices; (2) increased extracellular free-water content in the anterior cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and precuneus; (3) widespread microstructural anomalies in the cerebral white matter, marked by lower fractional anisotropy (FA), higher mean diffusivity (MD) and extracellular free-water, and a higher burden of markers of small vessel disease (WMH load and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity). Crucially, brain structural differences statistically mediated the link between AF and cognitive performance. By integrating a multimodal analysis approach with extensive clinical and MRI data, our study highlights small vessel pathology as a possible unifying link between AF, cognitive decline and abnormal brain structure. These insights can inform diagnostic approaches and motivate the ongoing implementation of effective therapeutic strategies.\nPlasma proteomic profiles of UK Biobank participants with Multiple Sclerosis\nAuthors: Jacobs, B. M.; Vickaryous, N.; Giovannoni, G.; Proitsi, P.; Waters, S.; Dobson, R.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293146\nObjective We aimed to describe plasma protein biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis risk and to explore protein biomarkers of disease severity using radiological outcome measures. Methods Multiple Sclerosis cases and controls were identified in UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort study of ~500,000 British adults. Plasma proteins were assayed in ~50,000 UK Biobank participants using the Olink proximity extension assay. We performed case-control association testing to examine the association between 2911 proteins and Multiple Sclerosis, using linear models adjusted for confounding covariates. Associations with radiological lesion burden and brain volume were determined in a subset of the cohort with available magnetic resonance imaging, using normalised T2-hyperintensity volume or whole brain volume as the outcome measure. Results 407 prevalent Multiple Sclerosis cases and 39,979 healthy controls were included. We discovered 72 proteins associated with Multiple Sclerosis at a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.05, including established markers such as Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. We observed a decrease in plasma Granzyme A, a marker of T cell and NK cell degranulation, which was specific to Multiple Sclerosis. Higher levels of plasma proteins involved in coagulation were associated with lower T2 lesion burden and preserved brain volume. Interpretation We report the largest plasma proteomic screen of Multiple Sclerosis, replicating important known associations and suggesting novel markers, such as the reduction in granzyme A. While these findings require external validation, they demonstrate the power of biobank-scale datasets for discovering new biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis.\nOcrelizumab B cell depletion has no effect on HERV RNA expression in PBMC in MS patients\nAuthors: Tarlinton, R. E.; Tanescu, R.; Shannon-Lowe, C.; Gran, B.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298370\nBackgroundEpstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection of B cells is now understood to be one of the triggering events for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a progressive immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. EBV infection is also linked to expression of Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of the HERV-W group, a further risk factor for the development of MS (Ocrelizumab is a high-potency disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for MS, which depletes B cells by targeting CD20. ObjectivesWe studied the effects of ocrelizumab on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from paired samples from 20 patients taken prior to and 6 months after beginning Ocrelizumab therapy. We hypothesised that EBV and HERV-W loads would be lower in post-treatment samples. MethodsSamples were collected in Paxgene tubes, subject to RNA extraction and Illumina paired end short read mRNA sequencing with mapping of sequence reads to the human genome using Salmon and Differential Gene expression compared with DeSeq2. Mapping was also performed separately to the HERV-D database of HERV sequences and the EBV reference sequence. ResultsPatient samples were more strongly clustered by individual rather than disease type (relapsing/remitting or primary progressive), treatment (pre and post), age, or sex. Fourteen genes, all clearly linked to B cell function were significantly down regulated in the post treatment samples. Interestingly only one pre-treatment sample had detectable EBV RNA and there were no significant differences in HERV expression (of any group) between pre- and post-treatment samples. ConclusionsWhile EBV and HERV expression are clearly linked to triggering MS pathogenesis, it does not appear that high level expression of these viruses is a part of the ongoing disease process or that changes in virus load are associated with Ocrelizumab treatment.\nIs Catheter Ablation Associated with Preservation of Cognitive Function? An Analysis From the SAGE-AF Observational Cohort Study\nAuthors: Srichawla, B. S.; Hamel, A. P.; Cook, P.; Aleyadeh, R.; Lessard, D.; Otabil, E. M.; Mehawej, J.; Saczynski, J. S.; McManus, D. D.; Moonis, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298768\nObjectives: To examine the associations between catheter ablation treatment (CA) versus medical management and cognitive impairment among older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: Ambulatory patients who had AF, were [\u0026ge;] 65-years-old, and were eligible to receive oral anticoagulation could be enrolled into the SAGE (Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Elements)-AF study from internal medicine and cardiology clinics in Massachusetts and Georgia between 2016 and 2018. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool at baseline, one-, and two years. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score [\u0026le;] 23. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression of longitudinal repeated measures was used to examine associations between treatment with CA vs. medical management and cognitive impairment. Results: 887 participants were included in this analysis. On average, participants were 75.2 +/- 6.7 years old, 48.6% women, and 87.4% white non-Hispanic. 193 (21.8%) participants received a CA before enrollment. Participants who had previously undergone CA were significantly less likely to be cognitively impaired during the two-year study period (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) than those medically managed (i.e., rate and/or rhythm control), even after adjusting with propensity score for CA. At the two-year follow-up a significantly greater number of individuals in the non-CA group were cognitively impaired (MoCA [\u0026le;] 23) compared to the CA-group (311 [44.8%] vs. 58 [30.1%], p=0.0002). Conclusions: In this two-year longitudinal prospective cohort study participants who underwent CA for AF before enrollment were less likely to have cognitive impairment than those who had not undergone CA.\nFTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes\nAuthors: Pasquini, L.; Pereira, F.; Seddighi, S.; Zeng, Y.; Ilan-Gala, I.; Vatsavayai, S.; Friedberg, A.; Lee, A.; Brown, J.; Spina, S.; Grinberg, L.; Sirkis, D.; Bonham, L.; Yokoyama, J.; Boxer, A.; Kramer, J.; Rosen, H.; Humphrey, J.; Gitler, A.; Miller, B.; Pollard, K.; Ward, M.; Seeley, W. W.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297687\nIn frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evolution of infarcts varies widely among patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and influences treatment decisions. Neuroimaging is not applicable for frequent monitoring and there is no blood-based biomarker to track ongoing brain injury in acute IS. Here, we examined the utility of plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) as a biomarker for brain injury in acute IS. We conducted the prospective, observational Precision Medicine in Stroke [PROMISE] study with serial blood sampling upon hospital admission and at days 2, 3, and 7 in patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and for comparison, in patients with stroke mimics (SM). We determined the temporal course of plasma BD-tau, its relation to infarct size and admission imaging-based metrics of brain injury, and its value to predict functional outcome. Upon admission (median time-from-onset, 4.4h), BD-tau levels in IS patients correlated with ASPECTS ({rho}=-0.21, P&lt;.0001) and were predictive of final infarct volume ({rho}=0.26, P&lt;.0001). In contrast to SM patients, BD-tau levels in IS patients increased from admission (median, 2.9 pg/ml [IQR, 1.8-4.8]) to day 2 (median time-from-onset, 22.7h; median BD-tau, 5.0 pg/ml [IQR, 2.6-10.3]; P&lt;.0001). The rate of change of BD-tau from admission to day 2 was significantly associated with collateral supply (R2=0.10, P&lt;.0001) and infarct progression ({rho}=0.58, P&lt;.0001). At day 2, BD-tau was predictive of final infarct volume ({rho}=0.59, P&lt;.0001) and showed superior value for predicting the 90-day mRS score compared with final infarct volume. In conclusion, in 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome. Further research is needed to determine whether BD-tau assessments can inform decision-making in stroke care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The investigation of the cognitive sequelae and alterations of brain structure linked to AF is crucial to help address ensuing health care needs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging analysis of 1335 stroke-free individuals with AF (30% women, average age 69.1 years) and compared them with 2683 demographically and cardiovascular risk-matched controls (31% women, average age 69.1 years). Primary study outcomes were neuropsychological test scores and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of gray matter morphology, gray and white matter microstructure, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load. Our analysis identified deficits in attention/executive function, information processing speed and reasoning in individuals with AF. These cognitive impairments were accompanied by a complex imaging profile suggestive of small vessel pathology: (1) reduced cortical thickness and gray matter volume in areas including primary motor, somatosensory and visual cortices as well as the orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and temporal cortices; (2) increased extracellular free-water content in the anterior cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and precuneus; (3) widespread microstructural anomalies in the cerebral white matter, marked by lower fractional anisotropy (FA), higher mean diffusivity (MD) and extracellular free-water, and a higher burden of markers of small vessel disease (WMH load and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity). Crucially, brain structural differences statistically mediated the link between AF and cognitive performance. By integrating a multimodal analysis approach with extensive clinical and MRI data, our study highlights small vessel pathology as a possible unifying link between AF, cognitive decline and abnormal brain structure. These insights can inform diagnostic approaches and motivate the ongoing implementation of effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective We aimed to describe plasma protein biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis risk and to explore protein biomarkers of disease severity using radiological outcome measures. Methods Multiple Sclerosis cases and controls were identified in UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort study of ~500,000 British adults. Plasma proteins were assayed in ~50,000 UK Biobank participants using the Olink proximity extension assay. We performed case-control association testing to examine the association between 2911 proteins and Multiple Sclerosis, using linear models adjusted for confounding covariates. Associations with radiological lesion burden and brain volume were determined in a subset of the cohort with available magnetic resonance imaging, using normalised T2-hyperintensity volume or whole brain volume as the outcome measure. Results 407 prevalent Multiple Sclerosis cases and 39,979 healthy controls were included. We discovered 72 proteins associated with Multiple Sclerosis at a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.05, including established markers such as Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. We observed a decrease in plasma Granzyme A, a marker of T cell and NK cell degranulation, which was specific to Multiple Sclerosis. Higher levels of plasma proteins involved in coagulation were associated with lower T2 lesion burden and preserved brain volume. Interpretation We report the largest plasma proteomic screen of Multiple Sclerosis, replicating important known associations and suggesting novel markers, such as the reduction in granzyme A. While these findings require external validation, they demonstrate the power of biobank-scale datasets for discovering new biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEpstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection of B cells is now understood to be one of the triggering events for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a progressive immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. EBV infection is also linked to expression of Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of the HERV-W group, a further risk factor for the development of MS (Ocrelizumab is a high-potency disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for MS, which depletes B cells by targeting CD20.

ObjectivesWe studied the effects of ocrelizumab on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from paired samples from 20 patients taken prior to and 6 months after beginning Ocrelizumab therapy. We hypothesised that EBV and HERV-W loads would be lower in post-treatment samples.

MethodsSamples were collected in Paxgene tubes, subject to RNA extraction and Illumina paired end short read mRNA sequencing with mapping of sequence reads to the human genome using Salmon and Differential Gene expression compared with DeSeq2. Mapping was also performed separately to the HERV-D database of HERV sequences and the EBV reference sequence.

ResultsPatient samples were more strongly clustered by individual rather than disease type (relapsing/remitting or primary progressive), treatment (pre and post), age, or sex. Fourteen genes, all clearly linked to B cell function were significantly down regulated in the post treatment samples. Interestingly only one pre-treatment sample had detectable EBV RNA and there were no significant differences in HERV expression (of any group) between pre- and post-treatment samples.

ConclusionsWhile EBV and HERV expression are clearly linked to triggering MS pathogenesis, it does not appear that high level expression of these viruses is a part of the ongoing disease process or that changes in virus load are associated with Ocrelizumab treatment.</p>

Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression of longitudinal repeated measures was used to examine associations between treatment with CA vs. medical management and cognitive impairment. Results: 887 participants were included in this analysis. On average, participants were 75.2 &#43;/- 6.7 years old, 48.6% women, and 87.4% white non-Hispanic. 193 (21.8%) participants received a CA before enrollment. Participants who had previously undergone CA were significantly less likely to be cognitively impaired during the two-year study period (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) than those medically managed (i.e., rate and/or rhythm control), even after adjusting with propensity score for CA. At the two-year follow-up a significantly greater number of individuals in the non-CA group were cognitively impaired (MoCA [&amp;le;] 23) compared to the CA-group (311 [44.8%] vs. 58 [30.1%], p=0.0002). Conclusions: In this two-year longitudinal prospective cohort study participants who underwent CA for AF before enrollment were less likely to have cognitive impairment than those who had not undergone CA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.</p>
