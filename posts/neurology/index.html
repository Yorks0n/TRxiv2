T.\nScore: 25.3, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.23295460\nRefractory neurological and psychiatric disorders are increasingly treated with brain stimulation therapies using implanted neuromodulation devices. Current commercially available stimulation systems, however, are limited by the need for implantable pulse generators and wired power; the complexity of this architecture creates multiple failure points including lead fractures, migration, and infection. Enabling less invasive approaches could increase access to these therapies. Here we demonstrate the first millimeter-sized leadless brain stimulator in large animal and human subjects. This Digitally programmable Over-brain Therapeutic (or DOT) is approximately 1 cm in width yet can produce sufficient energy to stimulate cortical activity on-demand through the dura. This extreme miniaturization is possible using recently developed magnetoelectric wireless power transfer that allows us to reach power levels required to stimulate the surface of the brain without direct contact to the cortical surface. This externally powered cortical stimulation (XCS) opens the possibility of simple minimally invasive surgical procedures to enable precise, long-lasting, and at-home neuromodulation with tiny implants that never contact the surface of the brain.\nNavigating the Neurological Aftermath of COVID-19: An In-Depth Exploration\nAuthors: Butt, M.; Nagpal, S.; Phillips, E.; Shah, S. Q.; Dogar, Z.; Loh, H.; Mishra, S.; Vijayan, R.; Jeyakumar, R.; Makkar, S. S.; Jahan, S.; Diaz, G. M.; Franca, H.; Javed, S.; Belizaire, M.-P.; Reddy Somagutta, M.\nScore: 140.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.23295343\nBackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people and can result in both immediate and prolonged neurological effects, including severe complications. While numerous studies have explored the occurrence and consequences of neurological issues in COVID-19, they have often involved limited sample sizes. PurposeThis paper aims to determine the overall occurrence of neurological complications in COVID-19, examine their links with patient demographics, and assess their impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, it seeks to provide an overview of the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms. MethodologyTwo systematic reviews were conducted to investigate acute and chronic neurological complications associated with COVID-19. A comprehensive search of medical databases was performed, and relevant studies were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with subgroup analysis and meta-regression used to assess heterogeneity. ResultsThe analysis of acute complications included 20,011 patients with an average age of 58.1 years and a slight male predominance (55.2%). Common neurological symptoms included loss of taste and smell, headaches, acute encephalopathy, and stroke. For the analysis of long-term complications, 2,094 patients were included. Survivors of COVID-19 experienced ongoing neurological issues ranging from sensory impairments to fatigue, headaches, strokes, and even cognitive and psychiatric problems. ConclusionBy examining various neurological symptoms, this study found a significant association between these manifestations and worse overall outcomes, especially in patients over 60 years old. Identifying high-risk individuals and maintaining a high level of suspicion are crucial for enhancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, validating biomarkers, and improving the management of these neurological issues.\nA blood biomarker of accelerated aging in the body associates with worse structural integrity in the brain: replication across three cohorts\nAuthors: Whitman, E. T.; Ryan, C. P.; Abraham, W. C.; Addae, A.; Corcoran, D. L.; Elliott, M. L.; Hogan, S.; Ireland, D.; Keenan, R.; Knodt, A. R.; Melzer, T. R.; Poulton, R.; Ramrakha, S.; Sugden, K.; Williams, B. S.; Zhou, J.; Hariri, A. R.; Belsky, D. W.; Moffitt, T. E.; Caspi, A.; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Score: 10.7, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295140\nBiological aging is the correlated decline of multi-organ system integrity central to the etiology of many age-related diseases. A novel epigenetic measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, incident dementia, and mortality. Here, we tested for associations between DunedinPACE and structural MRI phenotypes in three datasets spanning midlife to advanced age: the Dunedin Study (age=45 years), the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age=63 years), and the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (mean age=75 years). We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3,380; total N individuals=2,322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, and thinner cortex. In two datasets, faster DunedinPACE was associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensities. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes. Our findings suggest that single timepoint measures of multi-organ decline such as DunedinPACE could be useful for gauging nervous system health.\nDisparities in seizure outcomes revealed by large language models\nAuthors: Xie, K.; Ojemann, W. K. S.; Gallagher, R. S.; Lucas, A.; Hill, C. E.; Hamilton, R. H.; Johnson, K. B.; Roth, D.; Litt, B.; Ellis, C. A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295842\nObjective: Large-language models (LLMs) in healthcare have the potential to propagate existing biases or introduce new ones. For people with epilepsy, social determinants of health are associated with disparities in access to care, but their impact on seizure outcomes among those with access to specialty care remains unclear. Here we (1) evaluated our validated, epilepsy-specific LLM for intrinsic bias, and (2) used LLM-extracted seizure outcomes to test the hypothesis that different demographic groups have different seizure outcomes. Methods: First, we tested our LLM for intrinsic bias in the form of differential performance in demographic groups by race, ethnicity, sex, income, and health insurance in manually annotated notes. Next, we used LLM-classified seizure freedom at each office visit to test for outcome disparities in the same demographic groups, using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: We analyzed 84,675 clinic visits from 25,612 patients seen at our epilepsy center 2005-2022. We found no differences in the accuracy, or positive or negative class balance of outcome classifications across demographic groups. Multivariable analysis indicated worse seizure outcomes for female patients (OR 1.33, p = 3x10-8), those with public insurance (OR 1.53, p = 2x10-13), and those from lower-income zip codes (OR [\u0026ge;] 1.22, p [\u0026le;] 6.6x10-3). Black patients had worse outcomes than White patients in univariable but not multivariable analysis (OR 1.03, p = 0.66). Significance: We found no evidence that our LLM was intrinsically biased against any demographic group. Seizure freedom extracted by LLM revealed disparities in seizure outcomes across several demographic groups. These findings highlight the critical need to reduce disparities in the care of people with epilepsy.

        <p class="abstract">Biological aging is the correlated decline of multi-organ system integrity central to the etiology of many age-related diseases. A novel epigenetic measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, incident dementia, and mortality. Here, we tested for associations between DunedinPACE and structural MRI phenotypes in three datasets spanning midlife to advanced age: the Dunedin Study (age=45 years), the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age=63 years), and the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (mean age=75 years). We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3,380; total N individuals=2,322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, and thinner cortex. In two datasets, faster DunedinPACE was associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensities. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes. Our findings suggest that single timepoint measures of multi-organ decline such as DunedinPACE could be useful for gauging nervous system health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Large-language models (LLMs) in healthcare have the potential to propagate existing biases or introduce new ones. For people with epilepsy, social determinants of health are associated with disparities in access to care, but their impact on seizure outcomes among those with access to specialty care remains unclear. Here we (1) evaluated our validated, epilepsy-specific LLM for intrinsic bias, and (2) used LLM-extracted seizure outcomes to test the hypothesis that different demographic groups have different seizure outcomes. Methods: First, we tested our LLM for intrinsic bias in the form of differential performance in demographic groups by race, ethnicity, sex, income, and health insurance in manually annotated notes. Next, we used LLM-classified seizure freedom at each office visit to test for outcome disparities in the same demographic groups, using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: We analyzed 84,675 clinic visits from 25,612 patients seen at our epilepsy center 2005-2022. We found no differences in the accuracy, or positive or negative class balance of outcome classifications across demographic groups. Multivariable analysis indicated worse seizure outcomes for female patients (OR 1.33, p = 3x10-8), those with public insurance (OR 1.53, p = 2x10-13), and those from lower-income zip codes (OR [&amp;ge;] 1.22, p [&amp;le;] 6.6x10-3). Black patients had worse outcomes than White patients in univariable but not multivariable analysis (OR 1.03, p = 0.66). Significance: We found no evidence that our LLM was intrinsically biased against any demographic group. Seizure freedom extracted by LLM revealed disparities in seizure outcomes across several demographic groups. These findings highlight the critical need to reduce disparities in the care of people with epilepsy.
