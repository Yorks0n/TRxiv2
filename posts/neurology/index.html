SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment. MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment. ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS. DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.\nA systematic review of quantitative EEG findings in Long COVID, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nAuthors: Silva-Passadouro, B.; Tamasauskas, A.; Khoja, O.; Casson, A. J.; Delis, I.; Brown, C.; Sivan, M.\nScore: 34.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298171\nLong COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.\nProgression Subtypes in Parkinson's Disease: A Data-driven Multi-Cohort Analysis\nAuthors: Haehnel, T.; Raschka, T.; Sapienza, S.; Klucken, J.; Glaab, E.; Corvol, J.-C.; Falkenburger, B.; Froehlich, H.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296943\nBackgroundThe progression of Parkinsons disease (PD) is heterogeneous across patients. This heterogeneity complicates patients counseling and inflates the number of patients needed to test potential neuroprotective treatments. Moreover, disease subtypes might require different therapies. This work uses a data-driven approach to investigate how observed heterogeneity in PD can be explained by the existence of distinct PD progression subtypes. MethodsTo derive stable PD progression subtypes in an unbiased manner, we analyzed multimodal longitudinal data from three large PD cohorts. A latent time joint mixed-effects model (LTJMM) was used to align patients on a common disease timescale. Progression subtypes were identified by variational deep embedding with recurrence (VaDER). These subtypes were then characterized across the three cohorts using clinical scores, DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait biomarkers. To assign patients to progression subtypes from baseline data, we developed predictive models and performed extensive cross-cohort validation. ResultsIn each cohort, we identified a fast-progressing and a slow-progressing subtype. These subtypes were reflected by different patterns of motor and non-motor symptoms progression, survival rates, treatment response and features extracted from DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait assessments. Predictive models achieved robust performance with ROC-AUC up to 0.79 for subtype identification. Simulations demonstrated that enriching clinical trials with fast-progressing patients based on predictions from baseline can reduce the required cohort size by 43%. ConclusionOur results show that heterogeneity in PD can be explained by two distinct subtypes of PD progression that are stable across cohorts and can be predicted from baseline data. These subtypes align with the brain-first vs. body-first concept, which potentially provides a biological explanation for subtype differences. The predictive models will enable clinical trials with significantly lower sample sizes by enriching fast-progressing patients.\nLexical Markers of Disordered Speech in Primary Progressive Aphasia and Parkinson-plus Disorders\nAuthors: Henderson, S. K.; Ramanan, S.; Patterson, K. E.; Garrard, P.; Patel, N.; Peterson, K. E.; Halai, A.; Cappa, S. F.; Rowe, J. B.; Lambon Ralph, M. A.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.23298112\nConnected speech samples elicited by a picture description task are widely used in the assessment of aphasias, but it is not clear what their interpretation should focus on. Although such samples are easy to collect, analyses of them tend to be time-consuming, inconsistently conducted, and impractical for non-specialist settings. Here, we analysed connected speech samples from patients with the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA N = 9, lvPPA N = 9, nfvPPA N = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP Richardsons syndrome N = 10), corticobasal syndrome (CBS N = 13), and age-matched healthy controls. There were three principal aims. First, to determine the differences in quantitative language output and psycholinguistic properties of words produced by patients and controls. Second, to identify the neural correlates of connected speech measures. Third, to develop a simple clinical measurement tool: using data-driven methods, we optimised a 15-word checklist for use with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination cookie theft and Mini Linguistic Aphasia Examination beach scene pictures and tested the predictive validity of outputs from Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models using an independent clinical sample from a second site. The total language output was significantly reduced in patients with nfvPPA, PSP and CBS relative to those with svPPA and controls. Patients with lvPPA and svPPA were found to use a disproportionately greater use of words that were more frequent and semantically diverse. Results from voxel-based morphometry analyses across the whole group revealed correlations between grey matter volume in (i) bilateral frontal lobes with overall language output, (ii) the left frontal and superior temporal regions with speech complexity, (iii) bilateral frontotemporal regions with phonology, and (iv) bilateral cingulate and subcortical regions with age of acquisition. With the 15-word checklists, the LASSO models showed excellent accuracy for within-sample k-fold classification (over 95%) and out-of-sample validation between patients and controls (over 90%), and moderately good (59% - 70%) differentiation between the motor disorders (nfvPPA, PSP, CBS) and lexico-semantic groups (svPPA, lvPPA). In conclusion, we propose that a simple 15-word checklist provides a suitable screening test to identify people with progressive aphasia, while further specialist assessment is likely to be needed to differentiate accurately some groups (e.g., svPPA versus lvPPA and PSP versus CBS).\nMultiple Sclerosis in the Digital Health Age: Challenges and Opportunities - A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Specht, B.; Jager, H.; Garbaya, S.; Pincherle, A.; Sarvari, P. A.; Khadraoui, D.; Schneider, R.; Chavarriaga, R.; TAYEB, Z.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.23298084\nIn recent times, we have unequivocally witnessed a push towards digitising the healthcare system. Topics such as remote patient monitoring (RPM), digital health, and their use to monitor neurological disease progression have gained momentum and popularity. Notwithstanding the considerable advances that have been made in adopting such technologies and using them in the context of mental health or even a few neurodegenerative disease monitoring, they have not been widely used in the context of remote management and treatment of multiple sclerosis MS. In the same vein, given that (MS) is a very individualized disease to manage, there are numerous challenges yet opportunities associated with using digital health technologies for remote MS monitoring. This paper reviews the different research work and clinical attempts performed over the last decade (both home \u0026 hospital-based monitoring) en route to using digital health for MS monitoring and management. Similarly, this systematic review discusses the main challenges and barriers to translating that research from clinics into homes and highlights the opportunities in that context. Throughout this extensive review, we shine a light on various monitoring methods that hold the potential to be measured in a home environment, including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (e.g., motor evoked potential (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and visual evoked potential (VEP)), electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and speech analysis. Combining such digital biomarkers could pave the way for developing a more personalised treatment for MS patients, thereby stopping its progression and avoiding silent MS disability. Adopting digital health for remote monitoring and management could also chart a route ahead for a new era of personalised medicine for MS patients and potentially other brain disorder patients.\nPathways linking pulse pressure to dementia in adults with Down syndrome\nAuthors: Rizvi, B.; Lao, P. J.; Sathishkumar, M.; Taylor, L.; Queder, N.; McMillan, L.; Edwards, N.; Keator, D. B.; Doran, E.; Hom, C.; Nguyen, D.; Rosas, H. D.; Lai, F.; Schupf, N.; Guiterrez, J.; Silverman, W.; Lott, I. T.; Mapstone, M.; Wilcock, D. M.; Head, E.; Yassa, M. A.; Brickman, A. M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297625\nIndividuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{+/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.\n",

Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS.

DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe progression of Parkinsons disease (PD) is heterogeneous across patients. This heterogeneity complicates patients counseling and inflates the number of patients needed to test potential neuroprotective treatments. Moreover, disease subtypes might require different therapies. This work uses a data-driven approach to investigate how observed heterogeneity in PD can be explained by the existence of distinct PD progression subtypes.

MethodsTo derive stable PD progression subtypes in an unbiased manner, we analyzed multimodal longitudinal data from three large PD cohorts. A latent time joint mixed-effects model (LTJMM) was used to align patients on a common disease timescale. Progression subtypes were identified by variational deep embedding with recurrence (VaDER). These subtypes were then characterized across the three cohorts using clinical scores, DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait biomarkers. To assign patients to progression subtypes from baseline data, we developed predictive models and performed extensive cross-cohort validation.

ResultsIn each cohort, we identified a fast-progressing and a slow-progressing subtype. These subtypes were reflected by different patterns of motor and non-motor symptoms progression, survival rates, treatment response and features extracted from DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait assessments. Predictive models achieved robust performance with ROC-AUC up to 0.79 for subtype identification. Simulations demonstrated that enriching clinical trials with fast-progressing patients based on predictions from baseline can reduce the required cohort size by 43%.

ConclusionOur results show that heterogeneity in PD can be explained by two distinct subtypes of PD progression that are stable across cohorts and can be predicted from baseline data. These subtypes align with the brain-first vs. body-first concept, which potentially provides a biological explanation for subtype differences. The predictive models will enable clinical trials with significantly lower sample sizes by enriching fast-progressing patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connected speech samples elicited by a picture description task are widely used in the assessment of aphasias, but it is not clear what their interpretation should focus on. Although such samples are easy to collect, analyses of them tend to be time-consuming, inconsistently conducted, and impractical for non-specialist settings. Here, we analysed connected speech samples from patients with the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA N = 9, lvPPA N = 9, nfvPPA N = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP Richardsons syndrome N = 10), corticobasal syndrome (CBS N = 13), and age-matched healthy controls. There were three principal aims. First, to determine the differences in quantitative language output and psycholinguistic properties of words produced by patients and controls. Second, to identify the neural correlates of connected speech measures. Third, to develop a simple clinical measurement tool: using data-driven methods, we optimised a 15-word checklist for use with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination  cookie theft and Mini Linguistic Aphasia Examination  beach scene pictures and tested the predictive validity of outputs from Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models using an independent clinical sample from a second site. The total language output was significantly reduced in patients with nfvPPA, PSP and CBS relative to those with svPPA and controls. Patients with lvPPA and svPPA were found to use a disproportionately greater use of words that were more frequent and semantically diverse. Results from voxel-based morphometry analyses across the whole group revealed correlations between grey matter volume in (i) bilateral frontal lobes with overall language output, (ii) the left frontal and superior temporal regions with speech complexity, (iii) bilateral frontotemporal regions with phonology, and (iv) bilateral cingulate and subcortical regions with age of acquisition. With the 15-word checklists, the LASSO models showed excellent accuracy for within-sample k-fold classification (over 95%) and out-of-sample validation between patients and controls (over 90%), and moderately good (59% - 70%) differentiation between the motor disorders (nfvPPA, PSP, CBS) and lexico-semantic groups (svPPA, lvPPA). In conclusion, we propose that a simple 15-word checklist provides a suitable screening test to identify people with progressive aphasia, while further specialist assessment is likely to be needed to differentiate accurately some groups (e.g., svPPA versus lvPPA and PSP versus CBS).</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent times, we have unequivocally witnessed a push towards digitising the healthcare system. Topics such as remote patient monitoring (RPM), digital health, and their use to monitor neurological disease progression have gained momentum and popularity. Notwithstanding the considerable advances that have been made in adopting such technologies and using them in the context of mental health or even a few neurodegenerative disease monitoring, they have not been widely used in the context of remote management and treatment of multiple sclerosis MS. In the same vein, given that (MS) is a very individualized disease to manage, there are numerous challenges yet opportunities associated with using digital health technologies for remote MS monitoring. This paper reviews the different research work and clinical attempts performed over the last decade (both home &amp; hospital-based monitoring) en route to using digital health for MS monitoring and management. Similarly, this systematic review discusses the main challenges and barriers to translating that research from clinics into homes and highlights the opportunities in that context. Throughout this extensive review, we shine a light on various monitoring methods that hold the potential to be measured in a home environment, including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (e.g., motor evoked potential (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and visual evoked potential (VEP)), electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and speech analysis. Combining such digital biomarkers could pave the way for developing a more personalised treatment for MS patients, thereby stopping its progression and avoiding silent MS disability. Adopting digital health for remote monitoring and management could also chart a route ahead for a new era of personalised medicine for MS patients and potentially other brain disorder patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{&#43;/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.</p>
