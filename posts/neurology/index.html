H.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295362\nIn functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, episodic memory is commonly investigated with the subsequent memory paradigm in which brain activity is recorded during encoding and analyzed as a function of subsequent remembering and forgetting. Impaired episodic memory is common in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but only few studies have reported subsequent memory effects in AD or its risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One reason for this might be that subsequent memory responses may be blunted in AD or MCI and thus less likely to manifest in fMRI signal differences. Here, we used Bayesian model selection of single-subject fMRI general linear models (GLMs) for a visual novelty and memory encoding experiment to compare the model performance of categorical and parametric subsequent memory models as well as memory-invariant models in a clinical cohort (N = 468) comprising healthy controls (HC) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and AD, plus healthy relatives of AD patients (AD-rel). We could replicate the previously reported superiority of parametric subsequent memory models over categorical models (Soch et al., 2021a) in the HC and also in the SCD and AD-rel groups. However, memory-invariant models outperformed any model assuming subsequent memory effects in the MCI and AD groups.

W.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295260\nDystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterised by abnormal involuntary movements and postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for dystonia rely on simplified rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the impact of therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an efficient and accurate method that is rater-independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. To evaluate the framework, we leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort studies across seven academic centres in Germany. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical validation and derived kinematic variables reflecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was validated in a fully independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients. Computer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with clinically assigned scores, outperforming previous approaches employing specialised camera equipment. Across comparisons, we discovered a consistent set of kinematic features derived from full video assessments, which encoded information relevant to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural circuit intervention more strongly and independently of static head angle deviations predominantly used for scoring. The proposed visual perceptive machine learning framework reveals kinematic pathosignatures of dystonia which may be utilized to augment clinical management, facilitate scientific translation and inform personalised and precision approaches in Neurology.\nThe ABCs of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Blood Volume Measurement: A Simplified Quantitative Method Predicts Outcomes and Delayed Cerebral Ischemia.\nAuthors: Foettinger, F.; Sharma, R.; Salman, S.; Weston, A. D.; Erickson, B. J.; Huynh, T.; Tawk, R. G.; Freeman, W. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295090\nBackgroundWe sought to develop an easy-to-use quantifiable and more precise method to estimate total blood volume in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and explore its volumetric extent on incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcomes by modified Rankin Scale by hospital discharge. MethodsIn this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed 277 patients with SAH admitted at our Comprehensive Stroke Center between 2012 and 2022. We derived a mathematical model (Model 1) by measuring SAH basal cisternal blood volume using a ABC/2-derived ellipsoid formula (A=width/thickness, B=length, C=vertical extension) on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) in 5 major SAH cisternal compartments. We compared Model 1 (M1) against a manual segmentation method (Model 2) on noncontrast head CT (NCCT). Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis, t test, receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC), and area under curve (AUC) analysis. ResultsThere was no significant difference in cisternal SAH volume (SAHV) analysis between the two models (p=.14). Average SAHV by M1 was 7.0 mL (95% CI, 5,89-8,09) and lower for good outcome at discharge and 16.6 mL (95% CI, 13.49-19.77) for poor outcome. Volumetric analysis showed that patients with DCI had higher SAHV with 10 mL as a cutoff value (JABC-SAHV-outcome =10.0855 mL and JABC-SAHV-DCI =10.117 mL). ConclusionsA simplified ABC/2-derived method of SAH blood volume measurement is comparable to manual segmentation, and more importantly, can be performed in low-resource settings. Higher total SAH volumes by ABC/2-derived method were associated with worse outcomes and higher risk of DCI in this study population. A potential dose-response relationship of SAHV blood greater than 10mL appeared to predict worse outcomes and higher risk for DCI. A future larger prospective trial is being planned to validate these results.

S.; Simani, L.; Dworkin, J. D.; Buyukturkoglu, K. S.; Riley, C. S.; Leavitt, V. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294843\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is a pervasive, functionally limiting symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system that is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults. Recently, language dysfunction has received increased attention as a prevalent and early affected cognitive domain in individuals with MS. ObjectivesTo establish a network-level model of language dysfunction in MS. MethodsCognitive data and 3T structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 54 MS patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs). Summary measures of the extended language network (ELN) and structural imaging metrics were calculated. Group differences in ELN summary measures were evaluated. Associations between ELN summary measures and language performance were assessed in both groups; in the MS group, a two-step regression analysis was applied to assess relationships between additional language-specific imaging measures and language performance. ResultsIn comparison to the HC group, the MS group performed significantly worse on the semantic fluency and rapid automized naming tests (p \u003c 0.005). Concerning the ELN summary measures, the MS group exhibited higher within-ELN connectivity than the HCs (0.11 {+/-} 0.02 vs. 0.10 {+/-} 0.01, p \u003c 0.05, respectively). While no significant relationships between ELN summary measures and language function were observed in either group, the regression analysis identified a set of 17 imaging features that predicted performance on the rapid automized naming test (p \u003c 0.05) and identified key white matter tracts predicting language function in individuals with MS. ConclusionThe derived functional network-level measures, combined with the identified structural neuroimaging metrics, constitute a comprehensive set of imaging features to characterize language dysfunction in MS. Further studies leveraging these features may uncover underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant predictors of language dysfunction, potentially leading to improved precision treatment strategies for cognitively impaired patients with multiple sclerosis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterised by abnormal involuntary movements and postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for dystonia rely on simplified rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the impact of therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an efficient and accurate method that is rater-independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. To evaluate the framework, we leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort studies across seven academic centres in Germany. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical validation and derived kinematic variables reflecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was validated in a fully independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients. Computer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with clinically assigned scores, outperforming previous approaches employing specialised camera equipment. Across comparisons, we discovered a consistent set of kinematic features derived from full video assessments, which encoded information relevant to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural circuit intervention more strongly and independently of static head angle deviations predominantly used for scoring. The proposed visual perceptive machine learning framework reveals kinematic pathosignatures of dystonia which may be utilized to augment clinical management, facilitate scientific translation and inform personalised and precision approaches in Neurology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe sought to develop an easy-to-use quantifiable and more precise method to estimate total blood volume in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and explore its volumetric extent on incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcomes by modified Rankin Scale by hospital discharge.

MethodsIn this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed 277 patients with SAH admitted at our Comprehensive Stroke Center between 2012 and 2022. We derived a mathematical model (Model 1) by measuring SAH basal cisternal blood volume using a ABC/2-derived ellipsoid formula (A=width/thickness, B=length, C=vertical extension) on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) in 5 major SAH cisternal compartments. We compared Model 1 (M1) against a manual segmentation method (Model 2) on noncontrast head CT (NCCT). Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis, t test, receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC), and area under curve (AUC) analysis.

ResultsThere was no significant difference in cisternal SAH volume (SAHV) analysis between the two models (p=.14). Average SAHV by M1 was 7.0 mL (95% CI, 5,89-8,09) and lower for good outcome at discharge and 16.6 mL (95% CI, 13.49-19.77) for poor outcome. Volumetric analysis showed that patients with DCI had higher SAHV with 10 mL as a cutoff value (JABC-SAHV-outcome =10.0855 mL and JABC-SAHV-DCI =10.117 mL).

ConclusionsA simplified ABC/2-derived method of SAH blood volume measurement is comparable to manual segmentation, and more importantly, can be performed in low-resource settings. Higher total SAH volumes by ABC/2-derived method were associated with worse outcomes and higher risk of DCI in this study population. A potential dose-response relationship of SAHV blood greater than 10mL appeared to predict worse outcomes and higher risk for DCI. A future larger prospective trial is being planned to validate these results.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is a pervasive, functionally limiting symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system that is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults. Recently, language dysfunction has received increased attention as a prevalent and early affected cognitive domain in individuals with MS.

ObjectivesTo establish a network-level model of language dysfunction in MS.

MethodsCognitive data and 3T structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 54 MS patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs). Summary measures of the extended language network (ELN) and structural imaging metrics were calculated. Group differences in ELN summary measures were evaluated. Associations between ELN summary measures and language performance were assessed in both groups; in the MS group, a two-step regression analysis was applied to assess relationships between additional language-specific imaging measures and language performance.

ResultsIn comparison to the HC group, the MS group performed significantly worse on the semantic fluency and rapid automized naming tests (p &lt; 0.005). Concerning the ELN summary measures, the MS group exhibited higher within-ELN connectivity than the HCs (0.11 {&#43;/-} 0.02 vs. 0.10 {&#43;/-} 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). While no significant relationships between ELN summary measures and language function were observed in either group, the regression analysis identified a set of 17 imaging features that predicted performance on the rapid automized naming test (p &lt; 0.05) and identified key white matter tracts predicting language function in individuals with MS.

ConclusionThe derived functional network-level measures, combined with the identified structural neuroimaging metrics, constitute a comprehensive set of imaging features to characterize language dysfunction in MS. Further studies leveraging these features may uncover underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant predictors of language dysfunction, potentially leading to improved precision treatment strategies for cognitively impaired patients with multiple sclerosis.</p>
