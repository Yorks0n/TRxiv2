M.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299589\nBackground and ObjectivesThe epilepsy diagnosis still represents a complex process, with misdiagnosis reaching 40%. Here, we aimed at building an automatable workflow, to help the clinicians in the diagnostic process, differentiating between controls and a population of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While primarily interested in correctly classifying the participants, we used data features providing hints on the underlying pathophysiological processes. Specifically, we hypothesized that neuronal avalanches (NA) may represent a feature that encapsulates the rich brain dynamics better than the classically used functional connectivity measures (Imaginary Coherence; ImCoh). MethodsWe recorded 10 minutes of resting state activity with high-density scalp electroencephalography (hdEEG; 128 channels). We analyzed large-scale activation bursts (NA) from source activation, to capture altered dynamics. Then, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify epilepsy patients vs. controls, and we described the goodness of the classification as well as the effect of the durations of the data segments on the performance. ResultsUsing a support vector machine (SVM), we reached a classification accuracy of 0.87 {+/-} 0.10 (SD) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 {+/-} 0.06. The use of avalanches-derived features, generated a mean increase of 16% in the accuracy of diagnosis prediction, compared to ImCoh. Investigating the main features informing the model, we observed that the dynamics of the entorhinal cortex, superior and inferior temporal gyri, cingulate cortex and prefrontal dorsolateral cortex were informing the model with NA. Finally, we studied the time-dependent accuracy in the classification. While the classification performance grows with the duration of the data length, there are specific lengths, at 30s and 180s at which the classification performance becomes steady, with intermediate lengths showing greater variability. Classification accuracy reached a plateau at 5 minutes of recording. DiscussionWe showed that NA represents a better EEG feature for an automated epilepsy identification, being related with neuronal dynamics of pathology-relevant brain areas. Furthermore, the presence of specific durations and the performance plateau might be interpreted as the manifestation of the specific intrinsic neuronal timescales altered in epilepsy. The study represents a potentially automatable and noninvasive workflow aiding the clinicians in the diagnosis.\nLanguage Uncovers Visuospatial Dysfunction in Posterior Cortical Atrophy: A Natural Language Processing Approach\nAuthors: Rezaii, N.; Hochberg, D.; Quimby, M.; Wong, B.; McGinnis, S.; Dickerson, B. C.; Putcha, D.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298864\nIntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease. MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA. ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy. DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.\nThe presenilin 1 mutation P436S causes familial Alzheimer's disease with elevated Aβ43 and atypical clinical manifestations\nAuthors: Arber, C.; Belder, C. R. S.; Tomczuk, F.; Gabriele, R.; Buhidma, Y.; O'Connor, A.; Rice, H.; Lashley, T.; Fox, N. C.; Ryan, N. S.; Wray, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299395\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSFamilial Alzheimers disease (fAD) is heterogeneous in terms of age at onset and clinical presentation. A greater understanding of the pathogenicity of fAD variants and how these contribute to heterogeneity will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of Alzheimers disease more widely. The pathogenicity of the P436S mutation in PSEN1 remains unclassified. METHODSTo determine the pathogenicity of the PSEN1 P436S mutation, we studied an expanded kindred of 8 affected individuals, with MRI (2 individuals), patient-derived iPSC models (2 donors) and post-mortem histology (1 donor). RESULTSAn autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of fAD was seen with an average age at symptom onset of 46 years and atypical features including late spastic paraparesis and non-memory led cognitive impairment in some individuals. iPSC models and post- mortem tissue supported high production of A{beta}43. PSEN1 peptide maturation was unimpaired, unlike previously reported atypical mutations R278I and E280G. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that the P436S mutation in PSEN1 causes atypical fAD. The location of the mutation in the critical PSEN1 PALP motif may explain the early age of onset despite appropriate protein maturation.\nDelayed cortical engagement associated with balance dysfunction after stroke\nAuthors: Palmer, J. A.; Payne, A. M.; Mirdamadi, J. L.; Ting, L. H.; Borich, M. R.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299035\nCortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease.

MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA.

ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy.

DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSFamilial Alzheimers disease (fAD) is heterogeneous in terms of age at onset and clinical presentation. A greater understanding of the pathogenicity of fAD variants and how these contribute to heterogeneity will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of Alzheimers disease more widely. The pathogenicity of the P436S mutation in PSEN1 remains unclassified.

METHODSTo determine the pathogenicity of the PSEN1 P436S mutation, we studied an expanded kindred of 8 affected individuals, with MRI (2 individuals), patient-derived iPSC models (2 donors) and post-mortem histology (1 donor).

RESULTSAn autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of fAD was seen with an average age at symptom onset of 46 years and atypical features including late spastic paraparesis and non-memory led cognitive impairment in some individuals. iPSC models and post- mortem tissue supported high production of A{beta}43. PSEN1 peptide maturation was unimpaired, unlike previously reported atypical mutations R278I and E280G. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that the P436S mutation in PSEN1 causes atypical fAD. The location of the mutation in the critical PSEN1 PALP motif may explain the early age of onset despite appropriate protein maturation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.</p>
