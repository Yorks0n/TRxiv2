The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the \"clinico-radiological paradox\". The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables and lesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the \"clinico-radiological\" paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.\nValidation of remote collection and quantification of blood Neurofilament light in neurological diseases.\nAuthors: Coleman, A.; Touze, A.; Farag, M.; Pengo, M.; Murphy, M.

M.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299336\nPromising blood-based biomarkers of neuropathology have emerged with potential for therapeutic development and disease monitoring. However, these tools will require specialist tertiary services for integration into clinical management. Remote sampling for biomarker assessment could ease the burden of in-person clinical visits for such tests and allow for frequent sampling. Here we evaluated a capillary finger-prick collection for remote quantification of blood neurofilament light (NfL), a common blood-based biomarker evident in various neurological disorders, and other exploratory markers of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation (GFAP, tau). Matched samples from venepuncture and finger-prick were collected and processed into plasma and/or serum to directly compare NfL levels across four different neurological conditions (HD, MS, ALS, PD). Two delayed processing conditions were compared, three- and seven-day delay, simulating ambient shipment. Capillary NfL and GFAP concentrations were equivalent to those in venous blood serum and plasma. Only NfL remained stable after seven-day processing delay. Capillary NfL replicated disease group differences displayed in venous blood. This data supports our finger-prick method for remote collection and quantification of NfL. With the widespread applications for NfL across the spectrum of neurological disorders, this has the potential to transform disease monitoring, prognosis, and therapeutic development within clinical practice and research.\nEvaluating Clinical Presentation and Long-Term Outcomes in Individuals with Genetic and Non-Genetic Epilepsy Treated with Epilepsy Surgery: A Single-Center Study\nAuthors: Ivaniuk, A.; Bosselmann, C.; Pestana-Knight, E.; Zhang, X.; Jehi, L.; Bingaman, W.; Najm, I.; Lal, D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299306\nBackground: Many genetic epilepsy disorders are characterized by focal epilepsy or exhibit focal or lateralized features, which make individuals with such conditions potential surgical candidates. However, surgical outcomes in epilepsy caused by germline genetic variants and value of genetic testing in presurgical assessment remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included people with germline genetic epilepsy and non-genetic epilepsy identified among 2879 people with epilepsy who underwent resective surgery or laser ablation at Cleveland Clinic in years 1997-2022. We separated individuals with germline genetic epilepsies into mTORopathies (clinically or genetically diagnosed tuberous sclerosis and genetically diagnosed GATOR-related epilepsies) and other genetic etiologies. We compared clinical variables between the groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher tests as appropriate. We analyzed cumulative seizure recurrence risk over 5 years with Kaplan-Meier curves and used Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analysis. We repeated the analysis after matching both genetic sub-groups to non-genetic group 1:1 by propensity scores estimated by a generalized linear model. Results: We included 49 individuals with genetic epilepsies (32 individuals with mTORopathies and 17 individuals with other genetic etiologies) and 585 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy. Individuals with genetic epilepsies in both groups were younger at seizure onset (p\u003c0.001) and at surgery (p\u003c0.001), had a higher preoperative seizure frequency (p\u003c0.001), higher rate of developmental delay (p\u003c0.001), lower rate of focal interictal (p=0.005) and ictal (p\u003c0.001) findings on EEG, and more extratemporal and extensive resections (p\u003c0.001). At the last follow-up, individuals with other genetic etiologies had a lower rate of seizure freedom than individuals with mTORopathies and non-genetic etiologies; still, 70.6% achieved seizure reduction. Individuals with other genetic etiologies had a higher cumulative risk of seizure recurrence at 5 years both in univariate (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.4-6.74) and multivariate (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.69-8.62, p=0.001) analyses, which was reproducible in a matched cohort analysis. Conclusions: People with germline genetic epilepsy across multiple etiologies could be surgical candidates. However, seizure recurrence may be faster in genetic epilepsies other than mTORopathies. Further studies are required to clarify surgical candidacy in different genetic epilepsy disorders and establish the value of presurgical genetic testing.\nDelayed cortical engagement associated with balance dysfunction after stroke\nAuthors: Palmer, J. A.; Payne, A. M.; Mirdamadi, J. L.; Ting, L. H.; Borich, M. R.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299035\nCortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.\nImaging Drug Resistance in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy with MRI-derived Cortical Markers\nAuthors: Crespo Pimentel, B.; Kuchukhidze, G.; Xiao, F.; Caciagli, L.; Hoefler, J.; Rainer, L.; Kronbichler, M.; Vollmar, C.; Trinka, E.; Koepp, M.; Wandschneider, B.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23298783\nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is no longer considered a benign condition and can present a significant challenge due to lack of seizure control and concomitant neuropsychological impairment. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have described structural changes in individuals with different idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) syndromes but have so far failed to identify a distinct structural profile associated with drug resistant IGE. In this cross-sectional case-control neuroimaging analysis we included 79 participants with JME recruited at two European epilepsy referral centres, 43 of whom were drug resistant, as defined by recurrent seizures in the last 12 months despite adequate trials of at least two antiseizure medications (ASM), a drug sensitive group (n=37), and 78 healthy controls. Participants underwent T1-weighted MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including measures within two different domains: verbal memory and executive function. We performed vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness and neurodevelopmental cortical measures, i.e. white matter surface area and local gyrification index (LGI), through a surface-based framework with subsequent correction of scanner-related effects. Group comparisons (family-wise error (FWE) corrected at p\u003c0.05) showed an increase of surface area in prefrontal, cingulate and temporal regions with left-sided predominance accompanied by increased LGI in the left temporal lobe in drug-resistant compared to drug-responsive individuals with JME. Performance on executive function in participants with drug resistant JME was reduced compared to drug sensitive JME (p \u003c0.01) and controls (p\u003c0.001). Impaired executive function correlated with increased surface area in medial prefrontal and temporal cortical regions (r \u003c -0.75, p \u003c0.01) after correcting for disease duration and total ASM load. In conclusion, we identified a cognitive-developmental profile in drug resistant JME characterized by left-weighted changes in surface area and cortical folding complexity, the extent of which correlates with the degree of executive dysfunction. Our results shed further light onto the pathophysiological mechanisms of JME and suggest a neurodevelopmental/network basis for both drug refractoriness and cognitive impairment.\nSmall Fiber Neuropathy after COVID-19: A Key to Long COVID\nAuthors: McAlpine, L.; Zubair, A.; Joseph, P.; Spudich, S.\nScore: 195.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23297764\nObjectivesReport a case series of new onset small fiber neuropathy (SFN) after COVID-19 treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment. MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment. ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS. DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.\nMIAMI-AD (Methylation in Aging and Methylation in AD): an integrative knowledgebase that facilitates explorations of DNA methylation across sex, aging, and Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Lukacsovich, D.; O'Shea, D.; Huang, H.; Zhang, W.; Young, J.; Chen, X. S.; Dietrich, S.-T.; Kunkle, B.; Martin, E.; Wang, L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299412\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a significant impact on aging populations. DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been implicated in both the aging processes and the development of AD. Given that AD affects more women than men, it is also important to explore DNAm changes that occur specifically in each sex. We created MIAMI-AD, a comprehensive knowledge base containing manually curated summary statistics from 97 published tables in 37 studies, all of which included at least 100 participants. MIAMI-AD enables easy browsing, querying, and downloading DNAm associations at multiple levels: at individual CpG, gene, genomic regions, or genome-wide, in one or multiple studies. Moreover, it also offers tools to perform integrative analyses, such as comparing DNAm associations across different phenotypes or tissues, as well as interactive visualizations. Using several use case examples, we demonstrated that MIAMI-AD facilitates our understanding of age-associated CpGs in AD and the sex-specific roles of DNAm in AD. This open-access resource is freely available to the research community, and all the underlying data can be downloaded. MIAMI-AD (https://miami-ad.org/) facilitates integrative explorations to better understand the interplay between DNAm across aging, sex, and AD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, the presence of structural MRI lesions, and a &#34;no better explanation&#34; criterion. The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the &#34;clinico-radiological paradox&#34;. The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables and lesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the &#34;clinico-radiological&#34; paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Promising blood-based biomarkers of neuropathology have emerged with potential for therapeutic development and disease monitoring. However, these tools will require specialist tertiary services for integration into clinical management. Remote sampling for biomarker assessment could ease the burden of in-person clinical visits for such tests and allow for frequent sampling. Here we evaluated a capillary finger-prick collection for remote quantification of blood neurofilament light (NfL), a common blood-based biomarker evident in various neurological disorders, and other exploratory markers of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation (GFAP, tau). Matched samples from venepuncture and finger-prick were collected and processed into plasma and/or serum to directly compare NfL levels across four different neurological conditions (HD, MS, ALS, PD). Two delayed processing conditions were compared, three- and seven-day delay, simulating ambient shipment. Capillary NfL and GFAP concentrations were equivalent to those in venous blood serum and plasma. Only NfL remained stable after seven-day processing delay. Capillary NfL replicated disease group differences displayed in venous blood. This data supports our finger-prick method for remote collection and quantification of NfL. With the widespread applications for NfL across the spectrum of neurological disorders, this has the potential to transform disease monitoring, prognosis, and therapeutic development within clinical practice and research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Many genetic epilepsy disorders are characterized by focal epilepsy or exhibit focal or lateralized features, which make individuals with such conditions potential surgical candidates. However, surgical outcomes in epilepsy caused by germline genetic variants and value of genetic testing in presurgical assessment remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included people with germline genetic epilepsy and non-genetic epilepsy identified among 2879 people with epilepsy who underwent resective surgery or laser ablation at Cleveland Clinic in years 1997-2022. We separated individuals with germline genetic epilepsies into mTORopathies (clinically or genetically diagnosed tuberous sclerosis and genetically diagnosed GATOR-related epilepsies) and other genetic etiologies. We compared clinical variables between the groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher tests as appropriate. We analyzed cumulative seizure recurrence risk over 5 years with Kaplan-Meier curves and used Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analysis. We repeated the analysis after matching both genetic sub-groups to non-genetic group 1:1 by propensity scores estimated by a generalized linear model. Results: We included 49 individuals with genetic epilepsies (32 individuals with mTORopathies and 17 individuals with other genetic etiologies) and 585 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy. Individuals with genetic epilepsies in both groups were younger at seizure onset (p&lt;0.001) and at surgery (p&lt;0.001), had a higher preoperative seizure frequency (p&lt;0.001), higher rate of developmental delay (p&lt;0.001), lower rate of focal interictal (p=0.005) and ictal (p&lt;0.001) findings on EEG, and more extratemporal and extensive resections (p&lt;0.001). At the last follow-up, individuals with other genetic etiologies had a lower rate of seizure freedom than individuals with mTORopathies and non-genetic etiologies; still, 70.6% achieved seizure reduction. Individuals with other genetic etiologies had a higher cumulative risk of seizure recurrence at 5 years both in univariate (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.4-6.74) and multivariate (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.69-8.62, p=0.001) analyses, which was reproducible in a matched cohort analysis. Conclusions: People with germline genetic epilepsy across multiple etiologies could be surgical candidates. However, seizure recurrence may be faster in genetic epilepsies other than mTORopathies. Further studies are required to clarify surgical candidacy in different genetic epilepsy disorders and establish the value of presurgical genetic testing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cortical resources are typically engaged for balance and mobility in older adults, but these resources are impaired post-stroke. Although slowed balance and mobility after stroke have been well-characterized, the effects of unilateral cortical lesions due to stroke on neuromechanical control of balance is poorly understood. Our central hypothesis is that stroke impairs the ability to rapidly and effectively engage the cerebral cortex during balance and mobility behaviors, resulting in asymmetrical contributions of each limb to balance control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we assessed cortical N1 responses evoked over fronto-midline regions (Cz) during balance recovery in response to backward support-surface perturbations loading both legs, as well as posterior-lateral directions that preferentially load the paretic or nonparetic leg. Cortical N1 responses were smaller and delayed in the stroke group. While older adults exhibited weak or absent relationships between cortical responses and clinical function, stroke survivors exhibited strong associations between slower N1 latencies and slower walking, lower clinical mobility, and lower balance function. We further assessed kinetics of balance recovery during perturbations using center of pressure rate of rise. During backward support-surface perturbations that loaded the legs bilaterally, balance recovery kinetics were not different between stroke and control groups and were not associated with cortical response latency. However, lateralized perturbations revealed slower kinetic reactions during paretic loading compared to controls, and to non-paretic loading within stroke participants. Individuals post stroke had similar nonparetic-loaded kinetic reactions to controls implicating that they effectively compensate for impaired paretic leg kinetics when relying on the non-paretic leg. In contrast, paretic-loaded balance recovery revealed time-synchronized associations between slower cortical responses and slower kinetic reactions only in the stroke group, potentially reflecting the limits of cortical engagement for balance recovery revealed within the behavioral context of paretic motor capacity. Overall, our results implicate individuals after stroke may be uniquely limited in their balance ability by the slowed speed of their cortical engagement, particularly under challenging balance conditions that rely on the paretic leg. We expect this neuromechanical insight will enable progress toward an individualized framework for the assessment and treatment of balance impairments based on the interaction between neuropathology and behavioral context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is no longer considered a benign condition and can present a significant challenge due to lack of seizure control and concomitant neuropsychological impairment. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have described structural changes in individuals with different idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) syndromes but have so far failed to identify a distinct structural profile associated with drug resistant IGE. In this cross-sectional case-control neuroimaging analysis we included 79 participants with JME recruited at two European epilepsy referral centres, 43 of whom were drug resistant, as defined by recurrent seizures in the last 12 months despite adequate trials of at least two antiseizure medications (ASM), a drug sensitive group (n=37), and 78 healthy controls. Participants underwent T1-weighted MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including measures within two different domains: verbal memory and executive function. We performed vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness and neurodevelopmental cortical measures, i.e. white matter surface area and local gyrification index (LGI), through a surface-based framework with subsequent correction of scanner-related effects. Group comparisons (family-wise error (FWE) corrected at p&lt;0.05) showed an increase of surface area in prefrontal, cingulate and temporal regions with left-sided predominance accompanied by increased LGI in the left temporal lobe in drug-resistant compared to drug-responsive individuals with JME. Performance on executive function in participants with drug resistant JME was reduced compared to drug sensitive JME (p &lt;0.01) and controls (p&lt;0.001). Impaired executive function correlated with increased surface area in medial prefrontal and temporal cortical regions (r &lt; -0.75, p &lt;0.01) after correcting for disease duration and total ASM load. In conclusion, we identified a cognitive-developmental profile in drug resistant JME characterized by left-weighted changes in surface area and cortical folding complexity, the extent of which correlates with the degree of executive dysfunction. Our results shed further light onto the pathophysiological mechanisms of JME and suggest a neurodevelopmental/network basis for both drug refractoriness and cognitive impairment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesReport a case series of new onset small fiber neuropathy (SFN) after COVID-19 treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). SFN is a critical objective finding in long COVID and amenable to treatment.

MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen in the NeuroCOVID Clinic at Yale who developed new-onset SFN after a documented COVID-19 illness. We documented demographics, symptoms, treatments, diagnostics, and clinical response to treatment.

ResultsSixteen patients were diagnosed with length dependent or independent SFN on skin biopsy (median age 47, 75% female, 75% Caucasian). Among the nine patients tested for autoantibodies, six were positive for either trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Eight patients underwent treatment with IVIG and experience significant clinical improvement in their neuropathic symptoms. 92% of patients reported post-exertional malaise characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and six patients underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET), which demonstrated neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia consistent with ME/CFS.

DiscussionHere we present preliminary evidence that SFN is responsive to treatment with IVIG and linked with neurovascular dysregulation and dysautonomia. A larger clinical trial is indicated to further demonstrate the clinical utility of IVIG in treating post-infectious small fiber neuropathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a significant impact on aging populations. DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been implicated in both the aging processes and the development of AD. Given that AD affects more women than men, it is also important to explore DNAm changes that occur specifically in each sex. We created MIAMI-AD, a comprehensive knowledge base containing manually curated summary statistics from 97 published tables in 37 studies, all of which included at least 100 participants. MIAMI-AD enables easy browsing, querying, and downloading DNAm associations at multiple levels: at individual CpG, gene, genomic regions, or genome-wide, in one or multiple studies. Moreover, it also offers tools to perform integrative analyses, such as comparing DNAm associations across different phenotypes or tissues, as well as interactive visualizations. Using several use case examples, we demonstrated that MIAMI-AD facilitates our understanding of age-associated CpGs in AD and the sex-specific roles of DNAm in AD. This open-access resource is freely available to the research community, and all the underlying data can be downloaded. MIAMI-AD (https://miami-ad.org/) facilitates integrative explorations to better understand the interplay between DNAm across aging, sex, and AD.</p>
