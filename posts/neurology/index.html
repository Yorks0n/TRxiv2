A.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293450\n1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of \"adaptive\" neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.\nSubthalamic deep brain stimulation alleviates motor symptoms without restoring deficits in corticospinal suppression during movement preparation in Parkinson disease\nAuthors: Wilhelm, E.; Derosiere, G.; Quoilin, C.; Cakiroglu, I.; Paco, S.; Raftopoulos, C.; Nuttin, B.; Duque, J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293486\nBackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) patients exhibit alterations in neurophysiological mechanisms underlying movement preparation, especially the suppression of corticospinal excitability - called \"preparatory suppression\" - considered to propel movement execution by increasing motor neural gain in healthy individuals. ObjectiveDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) being an attractive treatment for advanced PD, we aimed to investigate the potential contribution of this nucleus to PD-related changes in such corticospinal dynamics. MethodsOn two consecutive days, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over both primary motor cortices in 20 PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS (ON vs. OFF), as well as 20 healthy control subjects. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at rest or during a left- or right-hand response preparation in an instructed-delay choice reaction time task. Preparatory suppression was assessed by expressing amplitudes of motor potentials evoked during movement preparation relative to rest. ResultsAdvanced PD patients exhibited a deficit in corticospinal suppression during movement preparation, limited to the responding hand (especially the most-affected), independently of STN-DBS. Significant links between preparatory suppression and clinical variables were found for least-affected hands only. ConclusionOur study provides evidence of altered corticospinal dynamics during movement preparation in advanced PD patients treated with STN-DBS. Consistent with results in earlier-stage patients, preparatory suppression deficits were limited to the responding hand and most pronounced on the most-affected side. STN-DBS did not restore this abnormality, which warrants further investigations into possible neuroanatomical sources of such corticospinal suppression, necessary to understand the consistent lack of this mechanism in PD patients.\nBiological variation estimates of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in healthy individuals\nAuthors: S. Brum, W.; J. Ashton, N.; Simren, J.; di Molfetta, G.; Karikari, T. K.; L. Benedet, A.; Zimmer, E. R.; Lantero-Rodriguez, J.; Montoliu-Gaya, L.; Jeromin, A.; K. Aarsand, A.; A. Bartlett, W.; Fernandez Calle, P.; Coskun, A.; Diaz-Garzon, J.; Jonker, N.; Zetterberg, H.; Sandberg, S.; Carobene, A.; Blennow, K.; EFLM Working Group on Biological Variation, Score: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293841\nIntroduction: Blood biomarkers have proven useful in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about their biological variation (BV), which plays a crucial role in the interpretation of individual patient data. Methods: We measured plasma amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42, A{beta}40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in fasting plasma samples collected weekly over 10 weeks from 20 participants aged 40-60y from the European Biological Variation Study. We determined within- (CVI) and between-subject (CVG) BV, analytical variation (CVA) and reference change values (RCV). Results: Biomarkers presented considerable variability in CVI and CVG. A{beta}42/A{beta}40 had the lowest CVI (~3%) and p-tau181 the highest (~16%), while the others ranged from 6-10%. Most RCVs ranged from 20-30% (decrease) and 25-40% (increase). Interpretation: We provide BV estimates for AD plasma biomarkers, which can potentially refine their clinical and research interpretation. RCVs might be useful for detecting significant changes between serial measurements when monitoring early disease progression or interventions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Blood biomarkers have proven useful in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), but little is known about their biological variation (BV), which plays a crucial role in the interpretation of individual patient data. Methods: We measured plasma amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42, A{beta}40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in fasting plasma samples collected weekly over 10 weeks from 20 participants aged 40-60y from the European Biological Variation Study. We determined within- (CVI) and between-subject (CVG) BV, analytical variation (CVA) and reference change values (RCV). Results: Biomarkers presented considerable variability in CVI and CVG. A{beta}42/A{beta}40 had the lowest CVI (~3%) and p-tau181 the highest (~16%), while the others ranged from 6-10%. Most RCVs ranged from 20-30% (decrease) and 25-40% (increase). Interpretation: We provide BV estimates for AD plasma biomarkers, which can potentially refine their clinical and research interpretation. RCVs might be useful for detecting significant changes between serial measurements when monitoring early disease progression or interventions.</p>
