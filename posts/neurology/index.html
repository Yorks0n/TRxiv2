Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.\nLesions causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome map to a common brain network linking body and size perception\nAuthors: Friedrich, M. U.; Baughan, E. C.; Kletenik, I.; Younger, E.; Zhao, C. W.; Howard, C.; Ferguson, M. A.; Chen, A.; Zeller, D.; Piervincenzi, C.; Tommasin, S.; Pantano, P.; Blanke, O.; Prasad, S.; Nielsen, J.; Fox, M. D.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301332\nBackgroundIn Lewis Carrolls 1865 novel \"Alices Adventures in Wonderland\", the protagonist experiences distortions in the size of her body and those of others. This fiction becomes reality in neurological patients with Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS). Brain lesions causing AIWS may offer unique insights into the syndromes elusive neuroanatomy. MethodsA systematic literature search identified 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS. Lesion locations were mapped onto a brain atlas and functional connectivity between each lesion location and other brain regions was estimated using resting-state fMRI data from 1000 healthy subjects. Connections common to AIWS lesions were identified and compared to connections from 1073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alignment between this lesion-derived AIWS network and neuroimaging findings from patients with AIWS due to other etiologies was assessed. ResultsAlthough AIWS lesions occurred in many different brain locations, these lesions fell within a specific, functionally connected brain network. This network was defined by connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, a brain region selectively activated by viewing body parts, and the inferior parietal cortex, a brain region involved in processing of size and scale. This connectivity pattern was specific to AIWS when compared to lesions causing other neuropsychiatric disorders and aligned with neuroimaging findings in patients with AIWS from other etiologies. ConclusionLesions causing AIWS fall within a specific brain network defined by connectivity to two distinct brain regions, one region involved in body perception and another in processing of size and scale.\nProbing a neural unreliability account of auditory sensory processing atypicalities in Rett Syndrome.\nAuthors: Brima, T.; Beker, S.; Prinsloo, K. D.; Butler, J. S.; Djukic, A.; Freedman, E. G.; Molholm, S.; Foxe, J. J.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301723\nBackgroundIn the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. MethodsAEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. ResultsSubstantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. ConclusionsTo accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.\nProteomic Changes in the Human Cerebrovasculature in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathies Linked to Peripheral Biomarkers in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid\nAuthors: Wojtas, A. M.; Dammer, E. B.; Guo, Q.; Ping, L.; Shantaraman, A.; Duong, D. M.; Yin, L.; Fox, E. J.; Seifar, F.; Lee, E. B.; Johnson, E. C. B.; Lah, J. J.; Levey, A. I.; Levites, Y.; Rangaraju, S.; Golde, T. E.; Seyfried, N. T.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301099\nDysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.\nAssociation between lifestyle at different life periods and brain integrity in older adults\nAuthors: Turpin, A.-L.; Felisatti, F.; Mezenge, F.; Landeau, B.; Vivien, D.; de la Sayette, V.; Chetelat, G.; Gonneaud, J.; Medit-Ageing Research Group, Score: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302049\nImportanceLifestyle factors have been associated with dementia risk and neuroimaging markers of ageing and Alzheimers Disease (AD), but the period at which they have the greatest influence remains unclear. ObjectiveTo determine the relative influence of lifestyle at different life periods on older adults brain health. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBaseline data from the Age-Well trial were used in this study. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 65 years and older were recruited in the general population between November 2016 to March 2018 in Caen, France. Analysis took place between June 2022 and September 2023. Exposure(s)The Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) was used to assess lifestyle during young adulthood (3-30y), midlife (30-65y) and late-life (\u003e65y). For each life period, LEQ score is divided into specific and non-specific subscores. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Multiple regressions were conducted including lifestyle at the three life periods (in the same model) to predict gray matter volume (GMv; from structural MRI), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), perfusion (Florbetapir-PET, early-acquisition) and amyloid burden (Florbetapir-PET, late-acquisition), both in AD-sensitive regions and voxel-wise, controlling for age and sex. Then, comparisons of correlations between lifestyle at each life period, as well as between specific versus non-specific activities, and neuroimaging outcomes were performed. ResultsOf the 135 older adults (mean age=69.3{+/-}3.79), 61.5% were women. No significant association was found between LEQ scores and AD-sensitive regions. While LEQ-young was not associated with neuroimaging, LEQ-midlife was more strongly associated with GMv, including in the anterior cingulate cortex, and with amyloid burden in the precuneus compared to the other periods. LEQ-late showed stronger associations with perfusion and glucose metabolism than LEQ-young and LEQ-midlife in medial frontal regions. Lower amyloid burden was more strongly correlated with LEQ-midlife specific than non-specific activities (z=-2.0977, p\u003c.05, [95% CI, -0.3985 - -0.0102]) while perfusion was more strongly correlated with LEQ-late non-specific than specific scores (z=2.4369, p\u003c.01, [95% CI, 0.0.415-0.4165]). Conclusions and RelevanceLifestyle at different life periods might have complementary benefits on structural/molecular versus functional markers of brain health in late-life. Interestingly, these associations were found in regions related to reserve/resilience and aging.

L.; Huang, H.; Cheung, B. M. Y.; Tse, G.; Chou, O. H. I.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301288\nBackgroundThere is a need to establish the role of lipid-lowering agents as a therapeutic option for Parkinsons Disease (PD), but its associations remain elusive. This study investigated genetic variants proxying lipid-lowering agents through HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 inhibitors to determine casual associations with PD risk. MethodsWe utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, where low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was the outcome of interest. Genetic associations with LDL were extracted from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Summary statistics for PD were extracted from two GWAS datasets, consistent of 1,843 PD cases and 216,630 control in the first dataset and 1,570 PD cases and 1,259 controls in the second dataset. Instrumental variables (IV) were optimized with positive control analyses on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. IV-exposure associations from LDL GWAS data were integrated with IV-outcome associations from the PD GWAS data. The inverse variance weighted method was applied. Bayesian colocalization analysis identified target gene regions for LDL and PD. ResultsGenetic variations in HMGCR were significantly associated with a reduced risk of PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). However, variation in HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype compared to the postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype (OR = 8.43, 95% CI 2.12-33.52). There were trends with increased risk for the TD subtype in NPC1L1 and a decreased risk in PCSK9 but these findings did not meet the Bonferroni threshold. We identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR within the same genomic region of close proximity, with rs12916 as the leading SNP associated with LDL and rs10942735 as the leading SNP associated with PD. ConclusionA casual association between HMGCR inhibition and reduced overall PD risk was identified, but there were increased the risks of tremor-dominant subtypes.\nSodium Valproate Modulates Cortical Morphology in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy\nAuthors: Crespo Pimentel, B.; Kuchukhidze, G.; Xiao, F.; Caciagli, L.; Hoefler, J.; Rainer, L.; Kronbichler, M.; Vollmar, C.; Duncan, J. S.; Trinka, E.; Koepp, M.; Wandschneider, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301048\nImportanceIdiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes in are associated with cortical thinning of the premotor areas. Whether this represents an underlying disease signature, a consequence of seizure activity or is related to anti-seizure medication is unknown. ObjectiveTo investigate valproate-related effects on cortical morphology in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), one of the most common IGE syndromes. DesignRetrospective neuroimaging case-control study. SettingRecruitment took place in epilepsy clinics in two European epilepsy referral centers. ParticipantsWe matched individuals with JME on valproate (n=36) to a group of healthy controls (n=36), as well as individuals with JME not on valproate (n=36) and a group of people with temporal lobe epilepsy (n=19) on valproate using propensity scores for age, sex, occurrence of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and drug refractoriness. Main outcomes and MeasuresAll participants underwent structural T1-weighted brain imaging and MRI-derived vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness were calculated. Results were reported in effect-sizes using cohens d. ResultsCompared to healthy controls, individuals with JME on valproate demonstrated cortical thinning bilaterally in the precentral gyri (left: d = -1.0, p \u003c.001; right: d = -1.0, p \u003c.001). This effect was localized to the left precentral gyrus when comparing JME on VPA with individuals with JME not on valproate (d = -0.89; p\u003c.01) or with individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy on valproate (d = -0.18, p \u003c.001). No significant differences in cortical thickness were detected between individuals with JME not on valproate and healthy controls. Cortical thinning in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and superior frontal was more marked with increasing valproate dose (left: t = -6,65, p \u003c.0001; right: t = -5,20, p \u003c.0001). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cross-sectional study of 91 patients with epilepsy, valproate treatment was associated with JME-specific and dose-dependent cortical thinning of the precentral gyri. Our findings suggest a valproate-induced reorganization of disease-specific areas in JME that may not only help explain the high efficacy of this medication in IGEs but also potentially account for previously described changes of cortical thickness in this disease group.\nA pathogenic variant in RAB32 causes autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease and activates LRRK2 kinase\nAuthors: Gustavsson, E.

J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24300927\nBackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD. MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed. FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C\u003eG (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase. InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.

        <p class="abstract">Cerebrovascular diseases are the second most common cause of death worldwide and one of the major causes of disability burden. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision making included patients history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4s recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn Lewis Carrolls 1865 novel &#34;Alices Adventures in Wonderland&#34;, the protagonist experiences distortions in the size of her body and those of others. This fiction becomes reality in neurological patients with Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS). Brain lesions causing AIWS may offer unique insights into the syndromes elusive neuroanatomy.

MethodsA systematic literature search identified 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS. Lesion locations were mapped onto a brain atlas and functional connectivity between each lesion location and other brain regions was estimated using resting-state fMRI data from 1000 healthy subjects. Connections common to AIWS lesions were identified and compared to connections from 1073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alignment between this lesion-derived AIWS network and neuroimaging findings from patients with AIWS due to other etiologies was assessed.

ResultsAlthough AIWS lesions occurred in many different brain locations, these lesions fell within a specific, functionally connected brain network. This network was defined by connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, a brain region selectively activated by viewing body parts, and the inferior parietal cortex, a brain region involved in processing of size and scale. This connectivity pattern was specific to AIWS when compared to lesions causing other neuropsychiatric disorders and aligned with neuroimaging findings in patients with AIWS from other etiologies.

ConclusionLesions causing AIWS fall within a specific brain network defined by connectivity to two distinct brain regions, one region involved in body perception and another in processing of size and scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is &#34;stationarity&#34; of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary.

MethodsAEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures.

ResultsSubstantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a &#34;neural unreliability&#34; account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident.

ConclusionsTo accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLifestyle factors have been associated with dementia risk and neuroimaging markers of ageing and Alzheimers Disease (AD), but the period at which they have the greatest influence remains unclear.

ObjectiveTo determine the relative influence of lifestyle at different life periods on older adults brain health.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBaseline data from the Age-Well trial were used in this study. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 65 years and older were recruited in the general population between November 2016 to March 2018 in Caen, France. Analysis took place between June 2022 and September 2023.

Exposure(s)The Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) was used to assess lifestyle during young adulthood (3-30y), midlife (30-65y) and late-life (&gt;65y). For each life period, LEQ score is divided into specific and non-specific subscores.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Multiple regressions were conducted including lifestyle at the three life periods (in the same model) to predict gray matter volume (GMv; from structural MRI), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), perfusion (Florbetapir-PET, early-acquisition) and amyloid burden (Florbetapir-PET, late-acquisition), both in AD-sensitive regions and voxel-wise, controlling for age and sex. Then, comparisons of correlations between lifestyle at each life period, as well as between specific versus non-specific activities, and neuroimaging outcomes were performed.

ResultsOf the 135 older adults (mean age=69.3{&#43;/-}3.79), 61.5% were women. No significant association was found between LEQ scores and AD-sensitive regions. While LEQ-young was not associated with neuroimaging, LEQ-midlife was more strongly associated with GMv, including in the anterior cingulate cortex, and with amyloid burden in the precuneus compared to the other periods. LEQ-late showed stronger associations with perfusion and glucose metabolism than LEQ-young and LEQ-midlife in medial frontal regions. Lower amyloid burden was more strongly correlated with LEQ-midlife specific than non-specific activities (z=-2.0977, p&lt;.05, [95% CI, -0.3985 - -0.0102]) while perfusion was more strongly correlated with LEQ-late non-specific than specific scores (z=2.4369, p&lt;.01, [95% CI, 0.0.415-0.4165]).

Conclusions and RelevanceLifestyle at different life periods might have complementary benefits on structural/molecular versus functional markers of brain health in late-life. Interestingly, these associations were found in regions related to reserve/resilience and aging.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is a need to establish the role of lipid-lowering agents as a therapeutic option for Parkinsons Disease (PD), but its associations remain elusive. This study investigated genetic variants proxying lipid-lowering agents through HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 inhibitors to determine casual associations with PD risk.

MethodsWe utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, where low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was the outcome of interest. Genetic associations with LDL were extracted from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Summary statistics for PD were extracted from two GWAS datasets, consistent of 1,843 PD cases and 216,630 control in the first dataset and 1,570 PD cases and 1,259 controls in the second dataset. Instrumental variables (IV) were optimized with positive control analyses on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. IV-exposure associations from LDL GWAS data were integrated with IV-outcome associations from the PD GWAS data. The inverse variance weighted method was applied. Bayesian colocalization analysis identified target gene regions for LDL and PD.

ResultsGenetic variations in HMGCR were significantly associated with a reduced risk of PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). However, variation in HMGCR was associated with an increased risk of the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype compared to the postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype (OR = 8.43, 95% CI 2.12-33.52). There were trends with increased risk for the TD subtype in NPC1L1 and a decreased risk in PCSK9 but these findings did not meet the Bonferroni threshold. We identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR within the same genomic region of close proximity, with rs12916 as the leading SNP associated with LDL and rs10942735 as the leading SNP associated with PD.

ConclusionA casual association between HMGCR inhibition and reduced overall PD risk was identified, but there were increased the risks of tremor-dominant subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceIdiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes in are associated with cortical thinning of the premotor areas. Whether this represents an underlying disease signature, a consequence of seizure activity or is related to anti-seizure medication is unknown.

ObjectiveTo investigate valproate-related effects on cortical morphology in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), one of the most common IGE syndromes.

DesignRetrospective neuroimaging case-control study.

SettingRecruitment took place in epilepsy clinics in two European epilepsy referral centers.

ParticipantsWe matched individuals with JME on valproate (n=36) to a group of healthy controls (n=36), as well as individuals with JME not on valproate (n=36) and a group of people with temporal lobe epilepsy (n=19) on valproate using propensity scores for age, sex, occurrence of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and drug refractoriness.

Main outcomes and MeasuresAll participants underwent structural T1-weighted brain imaging and MRI-derived vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness were calculated. Results were reported in effect-sizes using cohens d.

ResultsCompared to healthy controls, individuals with JME on valproate demonstrated cortical thinning bilaterally in the precentral gyri (left: d = -1.0, p &lt;.001; right: d = -1.0, p &lt;.001). This effect was localized to the left precentral gyrus when comparing JME on VPA with individuals with JME not on valproate (d = -0.89; p&lt;.01) or with individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy on valproate (d = -0.18, p &lt;.001). No significant differences in cortical thickness were detected between individuals with JME not on valproate and healthy controls. Cortical thinning in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and superior frontal was more marked with increasing valproate dose (left: t = -6,65, p &lt;.0001; right: t = -5,20, p &lt;.0001).

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cross-sectional study of 91 patients with epilepsy, valproate treatment was associated with JME-specific and dose-dependent cortical thinning of the precentral gyri. Our findings suggest a valproate-induced reorganization of disease-specific areas in JME that may not only help explain the high efficacy of this medication in IGEs but also potentially account for previously described changes of cortical thickness in this disease group.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD.

MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed.

FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C&gt;G (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase.

InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.
