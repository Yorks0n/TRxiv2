  "articleBody": " Pathways linking pulse pressure to dementia in adults with Down syndrome\nAuthors: Rizvi, B.; Lao, P. J.; Sathishkumar, M.; Taylor, L.; Queder, N.; McMillan, L.; Edwards, N.; Keator, D. B.; Doran, E.; Hom, C.; Nguyen, D.; Rosas, H. D.; Lai, F.; Schupf, N.; Guiterrez, J.; Silverman, W.; Lott, I. T.; Mapstone, M.; Wilcock, D. M.; Head, E.; Yassa, M. A.; Brickman, A. M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297625\nIndividuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n = 195, mean age (SD) = 50.6 (7.2), 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.\nMultivariate Age-related analysis of variance in quantitative MRI maps: Widespread age-related differences revisited\nAuthors: Moallemian, S.; Bastin, C.; Callaghan, M. F.; Phillips, C.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297253\nThis study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.\nSeparating representational and noise components of speech prosody perception after brain stroke\nAuthors: ADL ZARRABI, A.; Jeulin, M.; Bardet, P.; Commere, P.; Naccache, L.; Aucouturier, J.-J.; Ponsot, E.; Villain, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297140\nAfter a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation+noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.\nGenetic Analysis and Natural History of Parkinson's Disease Due to the LRRK2 G2019S Variant\nAuthors: Kmiecik, M. J.; Micheletti, S.; Coker, D.; Heilbron, K.; Shi, J.; Stagaman, K.; Filshtein Sonmez, T.; Fontanillas, P.; Shringarpure, S. S.; Schloetter, M.; Rowbotham, H. M.; Cannon, P.; Shelton, J. F.; Hinds, D. A.; Tung, J. Y.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Holmes, M. V.; Aslibekyan, S.; Norcliffe-Kaufmann, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297636\nThe LRRK2 G2019S variant is the most common cause of monogenic Parkinson's Disease (PD); however, questions remain regarding the penetrance, clinical phenotype, and natural history of carriers. We performed a 3.5 year prospective longitudinal online study in a large number of 1,286 genotyped LRRK2 G2019S carriers and 109,154 controls, with and without Parkinson's disease (PD) recruited from the 23andMe Research Cohort. We collected self-reported motor and non-motor symptoms every six months, as well as demographics, family histories, and environmental risk factors. Incident cases of PD (phenoconverters) were identified at follow-up. We determined lifetime risk of PD using accelerated failure time modeling and explored the impact of polygenic risk on penetrance. We also computed the genetic ancestry of all LRRK2 G2019S carriers in the 23andMe database and identified regions of the world where carrier frequencies are highest. We observed that despite a one year longer disease duration (p=0.016), LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD had similar burden of motor symptoms, yet significantly fewer non-motor symptoms including cognitive difficulties, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and hyposmia (all p-values\u003c0.0002). The cumulative incidence of PD in G2019S carriers by age 60 was 8.66%. G2019S carriers had a 10-fold risk of developing PD versus non-carriers. This rose to a 27-fold risk in G2019S carriers with a PD polygenic risk score in the top 25% versus non-carriers in the bottom 25%. In addition to identifying ancient founding events in people of North African and Ashkenazi descent, our genetic ancestry analyses infer that the G2019S variant was later introduced to Spanish colonial territories in the Americas. Our results suggest LRRK2 G2019S PD appears to be a slowly progressive predominantly motor subtype of PD with a lower prevalence of hyposmia, RBD, and cognitive impairment. This suggests that the current prodromal criteria, which are based on idiopathic PD, may lack sensitivity to detect the early phases of LRRK2 PD in G2019S carriers. We show that polygenic burden may contribute to the development of PD in the LRRK2 G2019S carrier population. Collectively, the results should help support screening programs and candidate enrichment strategies for upcoming trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in early-stage disease.\nElectroencephalographic insights into variant function and clinical outcomes in SCN2A encephalopathy\nAuthors: Fogerson, M.; Tsitsiklis, M.; Brimble, E.; Brunger, T.; Arslan, A. R.; Nerrie, J.; Laberinto, K. P.; Lacoste, A. M. B.; Martin, R. L.; Lal, D.; Pathmanathan, J.; Westover, B.; Fitter, N.; Donoghue, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23296360\nNeither phenotype nor genotype reliably predicts clinical disease severity or neurodevelopmental outcomes in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this study we examined the electroencephalographic (EEG) features of children with SCN2A variants to quantify the range of EEG abnormalities and link EEG biomarkers to developmental outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed data from a cohort of 28 children with SCN2A variants and employed a genetics-based consensus framework to infer the functional characterization of each subject's SCN2A variant. Eleven subjects were predicted to have a gain-of-function variant, and 17 subjects a loss-of-function variant. Overall, variant classifications matched subject phenotypes. 493 EEG recordings from the 28 subjects were analyzed (ages 1 day to 16 years). In addition to the SCN2A recordings, normative data from 1230 children without an epilepsy diagnosis or epileptiform features based on neurologists' review was analyzed (1704 EEG recordings, ages 0 days to 16 years). We detected interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the SCN2A recordings using Beacon's automated IED detection algorithm. We characterized background spectral features by computing relative power in four frequency bands (delta=1-4Hz, theta=4-8Hz, alpha=8-13Hz, beta=13-30Hz) in recordings from both the SCN2A and control cohorts. Additionally, we determined whether each SCN2A recording was associated with a gross motor developmental delay based on reported attainment of gross motor milestones. We then used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate the effect of EEG biomarkers on developmental delay. We characterized EEG abnormalities in the background spectral features of the SCN2A cohort compared to the controls and identified differences in EEG signatures between the subjects with gain- and loss-of-function variants. Additionally, we showed that background spectral features are correlated with motor developmental outcome when measured relative to age-matched neurotypical children. Furthermore, we showed that interictal epileptiform activity is correlated with delayed motor development in subjects with gain-of-function variants. Taken together, these findings suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to identify neurological abnormalities that correlate both with SCN2A variants and measures of development. We demonstrate the potential value of EEG as a disease biomarker, and we highlight the potential of such biomarkers to both guide future invasive genetic therapies and to be used as diagnostic tools.\nWake and non-rapid eye movement sleep dysfunction is associated with colonic neuropathology in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Sadoc, M.; Clairembault, T.; Coron, E.; Berthomier, C.; Le Dily, S.; Vavasseur, F.; Pavageau, A.; St. Louis, E. K.; Pereon, Y.; Neunlist, M.; Derkinderen, P.; Leclair-Visonneau, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296499\nStudy ObjectivesThe body-first Parkinsons disease (PD) hypothesis suggests initial gut Lewy body pathology that propagates to the pons before reaching the substantia nigra, and subsequently progresses to the diencephalic and cortical levels. This disease course may also be the most likely in PD with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). ObjectivesWe aimed to explore the potential association between colonic phosphorylated alpha-synuclein histopathology (PASH) and diencephalic or cortical dysfunction evidenced by non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and wakefulness polysomnographic markers. MethodsIn a study involving 43 patients with PD who underwent clinical examination, rectosigmoidoscopy, and polysomnography, we detected PASH on colonic biopsies using whole-mount immunostaining. We performed a visual semi-quantitative and automated quantification of spindle and slow wave features of NREM sleep, and the wake dominant frequency, and then determined Braak and Arizona stage classifications for PD severity based on sleep and wake electroencephalographic features. ResultsThe visual analysis aligned with the automated quantified spindle characteristics and the wake dominant frequency. Altered NREM sleep and wake parameters correlated with markers of PD severity, colonic PASH, and RBD diagnosis. Colonic PASH frequency also increased in parallel to presumed PD Braak and Arizona stage classifications. ConclusionsColonic PASH in PD is strongly associated with widespread brain sleep and wake dysfunction, pointing toward likely extensive diffusion of the pathological process in the presumptive body-first PD phenotype. Visual and automated analyses of polysomnography signals provide useful markers to gauge covert brain dysfunction in PD. Statement of SignificanceThe presence of gut synucleinopathy in Parkinsons disease can be linked to the body-first hypothesis in its pathophysiology. This study, performed in a cohort of 43 patients with Parkinsons disease that underwent clinical assessment, rectosigmoidoscopy and polysomnography, provides evidence that colonic neuropathology in Parkinsons disease is associated with widespread brain dysfunction, as evaluated by wake and non-rapid eye movement sleep polysomnographic markers. Our results support the assumption of an extensive diffusion of the pathological process to diencephalic and neocortical structures in the presumptive body-first phenotype. They also suggest the use of routine polysomnography in phenotyping patients with Parkinsons disease. Future studies should investigate the brain diffusion pattern and its sleep markers in the hypothesized brain-first phenotype of Parkinsons disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n = 195, mean age (SD) = 50.6 (7.2), 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study utilized multivariate ANOVA analysis to investigate age-related microstructural changes in the brain tissues driven primarily by myelin, iron, and water content. Voxel-wise analyses were performed on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), in addition to region of interest (ROI) analyses. The multivariate approach identified brain regions showing coordinated alterations in multiple tissue properties and demonstrated bidirectional correlations between age and all examined modalities in various brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, insula, cerebellum, lingual gyri, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. The multivariate model was more sensitive than univariate analyses as evidenced by detecting a larger number of significant voxels within clusters in the supplementary motor area, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, occipital cortex, and cerebellum bilaterally. The examination of normalized, smoothed, and z-transformed maps within the ROIs revealed age-dependent differences in myelin, iron, and water content. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain differences and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging. The study emphasizes the importance of multivariate analysis for detecting subtle microstructural changes associated with aging that may motivate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation&#43;noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The LRRK2 G2019S variant is the most common cause of monogenic Parkinson&#39;s Disease (PD); however, questions remain regarding the penetrance, clinical phenotype, and natural history of carriers. We performed a 3.5 year prospective longitudinal online study in a large number of 1,286 genotyped LRRK2 G2019S carriers and 109,154 controls, with and without Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) recruited from the 23andMe Research Cohort. We collected self-reported motor and non-motor symptoms every six months, as well as demographics, family histories, and environmental risk factors. Incident cases of PD (phenoconverters) were identified at follow-up. We determined lifetime risk of PD using accelerated failure time modeling and explored the impact of polygenic risk on penetrance. We also computed the genetic ancestry of all LRRK2 G2019S carriers in the 23andMe database and identified regions of the world where carrier frequencies are highest. We observed that despite a one year longer disease duration (p=0.016), LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD had similar burden of motor symptoms, yet significantly fewer non-motor symptoms including cognitive difficulties, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and hyposmia (all p-values&lt;0.0002). The cumulative incidence of PD in G2019S carriers by age 60 was 8.66%. G2019S carriers had a 10-fold risk of developing PD versus non-carriers. This rose to a 27-fold risk in G2019S carriers with a PD polygenic risk score in the top 25% versus non-carriers in the bottom 25%. In addition to identifying ancient founding events in people of North African and Ashkenazi descent, our genetic ancestry analyses infer that the G2019S variant was later introduced to Spanish colonial territories in the Americas. Our results suggest LRRK2 G2019S PD appears to be a slowly progressive predominantly motor subtype of PD with a lower prevalence of hyposmia, RBD, and cognitive impairment. This suggests that the current prodromal criteria, which are based on idiopathic PD, may lack sensitivity to detect the early phases of LRRK2 PD in G2019S carriers. We show that polygenic burden may contribute to the development of PD in the LRRK2 G2019S carrier population. Collectively, the results should help support screening programs and candidate enrichment strategies for upcoming trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in early-stage disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neither phenotype nor genotype reliably predicts clinical disease severity or neurodevelopmental outcomes in SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this study we examined the electroencephalographic (EEG) features of children with SCN2A variants to quantify the range of EEG abnormalities and link EEG biomarkers to developmental outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed data from a cohort of 28 children with SCN2A variants and employed a genetics-based consensus framework to infer the functional characterization of each subject&#39;s SCN2A variant. Eleven subjects were predicted to have a gain-of-function variant, and 17 subjects a loss-of-function variant. Overall, variant classifications matched subject phenotypes. 493 EEG recordings from the 28 subjects were analyzed (ages 1 day to 16 years). In addition to the SCN2A recordings, normative data from 1230 children without an epilepsy diagnosis or epileptiform features based on neurologists&#39; review was analyzed (1704 EEG recordings, ages 0 days to 16 years). We detected interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the SCN2A recordings using Beacon&#39;s automated IED detection algorithm. We characterized background spectral features by computing relative power in four frequency bands (delta=1-4Hz, theta=4-8Hz, alpha=8-13Hz, beta=13-30Hz) in recordings from both the SCN2A and control cohorts. Additionally, we determined whether each SCN2A recording was associated with a gross motor developmental delay based on reported attainment of gross motor milestones. We then used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate the effect of EEG biomarkers on developmental delay. We characterized EEG abnormalities in the background spectral features of the SCN2A cohort compared to the controls and identified differences in EEG signatures between the subjects with gain- and loss-of-function variants. Additionally, we showed that background spectral features are correlated with motor developmental outcome when measured relative to age-matched neurotypical children. Furthermore, we showed that interictal epileptiform activity is correlated with delayed motor development in subjects with gain-of-function variants. Taken together, these findings suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to identify neurological abnormalities that correlate both with SCN2A variants and measures of development. We demonstrate the potential value of EEG as a disease biomarker, and we highlight the potential of such biomarkers to both guide future invasive genetic therapies and to be used as diagnostic tools.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Study ObjectivesThe body-first Parkinsons disease (PD) hypothesis suggests initial gut Lewy body pathology that propagates to the pons before reaching the substantia nigra, and subsequently progresses to the diencephalic and cortical levels. This disease course may also be the most likely in PD with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD).

ObjectivesWe aimed to explore the potential association between colonic phosphorylated alpha-synuclein histopathology (PASH) and diencephalic or cortical dysfunction evidenced by non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and wakefulness polysomnographic markers.

MethodsIn a study involving 43 patients with PD who underwent clinical examination, rectosigmoidoscopy, and polysomnography, we detected PASH on colonic biopsies using whole-mount immunostaining. We performed a visual semi-quantitative and automated quantification of spindle and slow wave features of NREM sleep, and the wake dominant frequency, and then determined Braak and Arizona stage classifications for PD severity based on sleep and wake electroencephalographic features.

ResultsThe visual analysis aligned with the automated quantified spindle characteristics and the wake dominant frequency. Altered NREM sleep and wake parameters correlated with markers of PD severity, colonic PASH, and RBD diagnosis. Colonic PASH frequency also increased in parallel to presumed PD Braak and Arizona stage classifications.

ConclusionsColonic PASH in PD is strongly associated with widespread brain sleep and wake dysfunction, pointing toward likely extensive diffusion of the pathological process in the presumptive body-first PD phenotype. Visual and automated analyses of polysomnography signals provide useful markers to gauge covert brain dysfunction in PD.

Statement of SignificanceThe presence of gut synucleinopathy in Parkinsons disease can be linked to the body-first hypothesis in its pathophysiology. This study, performed in a cohort of 43 patients with Parkinsons disease that underwent clinical assessment, rectosigmoidoscopy and polysomnography, provides evidence that colonic neuropathology in Parkinsons disease is associated with widespread brain dysfunction, as evaluated by wake and non-rapid eye movement sleep polysomnographic markers. Our results support the assumption of an extensive diffusion of the pathological process to diencephalic and neocortical structures in the presumptive body-first phenotype. They also suggest the use of routine polysomnography in phenotyping patients with Parkinsons disease. Future studies should investigate the brain diffusion pattern and its sleep markers in the hypothesized brain-first phenotype of Parkinsons disease.</p>
