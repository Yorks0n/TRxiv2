Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.\nMotoric Cognitive Risk syndrome trajectories and incident dementia over 10 years\nAuthors: Mullin, D.; Gadd, D.; Russ, T. C.; Luciano, M.; Muniz, G.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291741\nBackgroundMotoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome is a high-risk state for adverse health outcomes in older adults characterised by measured slow gait speed and self-reported cognitive complaints. The recent addition to the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 of robust dementia outcomes enabled us to assess the prognostic value of MCR for dementia and explore the various trajectories of participants diagnosed with MCR. MethodsWe classified 680 community-dwelling participants free from dementia into non-MCR or MCR groups at mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years. We used Cox and competing risk regression methods, adjusted for potential confounders, to evaluate the risk of developing all-cause incident dementia over 10 years of follow-up. Secondarily, we followed the trajectories for individuals with and without MCR at baseline and categorised them into subgroups based on whether MCR was still present at the next research wave, three years later. ResultsThe presence of MCR increased the risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR 2.34, 95%CI 1.14-4.78, p=0.020), as did fewer years of education and higher depression symptoms. However, MCR has a heterogenous progression trajectory. The MCR progression subgroups each have different prognostic values for incident dementia. ConclusionMCR showed similar prognostic ability for dementia in a Scottish cohort as for other populations. MCR could identify a target group for early interventions of modifiable risk factors to prevent incident dementia. This study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of MCR progression. Exploring the underlying reasons will be important work in future work.\nMapping the relationship of white matter lesions to depression in multiple sclerosis\nAuthors: Baller, E. B.; Sweeney, E. M.; Cieslak, M. C.; Robert-Fitzgerald, T.; Covitz, S. C.; Martin, M. L.; Schindler, M. K.; Bar-Or, A.; Elahie, A.; Larsen, B. S.; Manning, A. R.; Markowitz, C. E.; Perrone, C. M.; Rautman, V.; Seitz, M.; Detre, J. A.; Fox, M. D.; Shinohara, R. T.; Satterthwaite, T. D.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23291080\nImportanceMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects nearly one million people in the United States. Up to 50% of patients with MS experience depression. ObjectiveTo investigate how white matter network disruption is related to depression in MS. DesignRetrospective case-control study of participants who received research-quality 3-tesla neuroimaging as part of MS clinical care from 2010-2018. Analyses were performed from May 1 to September 30, 2022. SettingSingle-center academic medical specialty MS clinic. ParticipantsParticipants with MS were identified via the electronic health record (EHR). All participants were diagnosed by an MS specialist and completed research-quality MRI at 3T. After excluding participants with poor image quality, 783 were included. Inclusion in the depression group (MS+Depression) required either: 1) ICD-10 depression diagnosis (F32-F34.*); 2) prescription of antidepressant medication; or 3) screening positive via Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or -9 (PHQ-9). Age- and sex-matched nondepressed comparators (MS-Depression) included persons with no depression diagnosis, no psychiatric medications, and were asymptomatic on PHQ-2/9. ExposureDepression diagnosis. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)We first evaluated if lesions were preferentially located within the depression network compared to other brain regions. Next, we examined if MS+Depression patients had greater lesion burden, and if this was driven by lesions specifically in the depression network. Outcome measures were the burden of lesions (e.g., impacted fascicles) within a network and across the brain. Secondary measures included between-diagnosis lesion burden, stratified by brain network. Linear mixed-effects models were employed. ResultsThree hundred-eighty participants met inclusion criteria, (232 MS+Depression: age[SD]=49[12], %females=86; 148 MS-Depression: age[SD]=47[13], %females=79). MS lesions preferentially affected fascicles within versus outside the depression network ({beta}=0.09, 95% CI=0.08-0.10, P\u003c0.001). MS+Depression had more white matter lesion burden ({beta}=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10, P=0.015); this was driven by lesions within the depression network ({beta}=0.02, 95% CI 0.003-0.040, P=0.020). Conclusions and RelevanceWe provide new evidence supporting a relationship between white matter lesions and depression in MS. MS lesions disproportionately impacted fascicles in the depression network. MS+Depression had more disease than MS-Depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network. Future studies relating lesion location to personalized depression interventions are warranted. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre white matter lesions that impact fascicles connecting a previously-described depression network associated with depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)? FindingsIn this retrospective, case-control study of patients with MS including 232 patients with depression and 148 nondepressed MS comparators, patients with MS had more disease within the depression network, irrespective of depression diagnosis. Patients with depression had more disease than those without depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network specifically. MeaningLesion location and burden may contribute to depression comorbidity in MS.\nMachine Learning Interpretability Methods to Characterize Brain Network Dynamics in Epilepsy\nAuthors: Upadhyaya, D. P.; Prantzalos, K.; Thyagaraj, S.; Shafiabadi, N.; Fernandez-BacaVaca, G.; Sivagnanam, S.; Majumdar, A.; Sahoo, S. S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.23291874\nThe rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) algorithms in medical disciplines has raised concerns about trust and the lack of understanding of their results. Efforts are being made to develop more interpretable models and establish guidelines for transparency and ethical use, ensuring the responsible integration of machine learning in healthcare. In this study we use two ML interpretability methods to gain insights into the dynamics of brain network interactions in epilepsy, a neurological disorder increasingly viewed as a network disorder that affects more than 60 million persons worldwide. Using high-resolution intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from a cohort of 16 patients, combined with high-accuracy ML algorithms, we classify EEG recordings into binary classes of seizure and non-seizure, as well as multiple classes corresponding to different phases of a seizure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that ML interpretability methods can provide new insights into the dynamics of aberrant brain networks in neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Moreover, we show that interpretability methods can effectively identify key brain regions and network connections involved in the disruptions of brain networks, such as those that occur during seizure events. These findings emphasize the importance of continued research into the integration of ML algorithms and interpretability methods in medical disciplines and enable the discovery of new insights into the dynamics of aberrant brain networks in epilepsy patient.\n",

MethodsWe classified 680 community-dwelling participants free from dementia into non-MCR or MCR groups at mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years. We used Cox and competing risk regression methods, adjusted for potential confounders, to evaluate the risk of developing all-cause incident dementia over 10 years of follow-up. Secondarily, we followed the trajectories for individuals with and without MCR at baseline and categorised them into subgroups based on whether MCR was still present at the next research wave, three years later.

ResultsThe presence of MCR increased the risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR 2.34, 95%CI 1.14-4.78, p=0.020), as did fewer years of education and higher depression symptoms. However, MCR has a heterogenous progression trajectory. The MCR progression subgroups each have different prognostic values for incident dementia.

ConclusionMCR showed similar prognostic ability for dementia in a Scottish cohort as for other populations. MCR could identify a target group for early interventions of modifiable risk factors to prevent incident dementia. This study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of MCR progression. Exploring the underlying reasons will be important work in future work.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects nearly one million people in the United States. Up to 50% of patients with MS experience depression.

ObjectiveTo investigate how white matter network disruption is related to depression in MS.

DesignRetrospective case-control study of participants who received research-quality 3-tesla neuroimaging as part of MS clinical care from 2010-2018. Analyses were performed from May 1 to September 30, 2022.

SettingSingle-center academic medical specialty MS clinic.

ParticipantsParticipants with MS were identified via the electronic health record (EHR). All participants were diagnosed by an MS specialist and completed research-quality MRI at 3T. After excluding participants with poor image quality, 783 were included. Inclusion in the depression group (MS&#43;Depression) required either: 1) ICD-10 depression diagnosis (F32-F34.*); 2) prescription of antidepressant medication; or 3) screening positive via Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or -9 (PHQ-9). Age- and sex-matched nondepressed comparators (MS-Depression) included persons with no depression diagnosis, no psychiatric medications, and were asymptomatic on PHQ-2/9.

ExposureDepression diagnosis.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)We first evaluated if lesions were preferentially located within the depression network compared to other brain regions. Next, we examined if MS&#43;Depression patients had greater lesion burden, and if this was driven by lesions specifically in the depression network. Outcome measures were the burden of lesions (e.g., impacted fascicles) within a network and across the brain. Secondary measures included between-diagnosis lesion burden, stratified by brain network. Linear mixed-effects models were employed.

ResultsThree hundred-eighty participants met inclusion criteria, (232 MS&#43;Depression: age[SD]=49[12], %females=86; 148 MS-Depression: age[SD]=47[13], %females=79). MS lesions preferentially affected fascicles within versus outside the depression network ({beta}=0.09, 95% CI=0.08-0.10, P&lt;0.001). MS&#43;Depression had more white matter lesion burden ({beta}=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10, P=0.015); this was driven by lesions within the depression network ({beta}=0.02, 95% CI 0.003-0.040, P=0.020).

Conclusions and RelevanceWe provide new evidence supporting a relationship between white matter lesions and depression in MS. MS lesions disproportionately impacted fascicles in the depression network. MS&#43;Depression had more disease than MS-Depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network. Future studies relating lesion location to personalized depression interventions are warranted.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre white matter lesions that impact fascicles connecting a previously-described depression network associated with depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)?

FindingsIn this retrospective, case-control study of patients with MS including 232 patients with depression and 148 nondepressed MS comparators, patients with MS had more disease within the depression network, irrespective of depression diagnosis. Patients with depression had more disease than those without depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network specifically.

MeaningLesion location and burden may contribute to depression comorbidity in MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) algorithms in medical disciplines has raised concerns about trust and the lack of understanding of their results. Efforts are being made to develop more interpretable models and establish guidelines for transparency and ethical use, ensuring the responsible integration of machine learning in healthcare. In this study we use two ML interpretability methods to gain insights into the dynamics of brain network interactions in epilepsy, a neurological disorder increasingly viewed as a network disorder that affects more than 60 million persons worldwide. Using high-resolution intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from a cohort of 16 patients, combined with high-accuracy ML algorithms, we classify EEG recordings into binary classes of seizure and non-seizure, as well as multiple classes corresponding to different phases of a seizure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that ML interpretability methods can provide new insights into the dynamics of aberrant brain networks in neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Moreover, we show that interpretability methods can effectively identify key brain regions and network connections involved in the disruptions of brain networks, such as those that occur during seizure events. These findings emphasize the importance of continued research into the integration of ML algorithms and interpretability methods in medical disciplines and enable the discovery of new insights into the dynamics of aberrant brain networks in epilepsy patient.</p>
