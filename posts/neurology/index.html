R.\nScore: 69.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294253\nVitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination.1 Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline.2,3,4 However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.\nDigital cognitive test performance and relationship to plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Toniolo, S.; Zhao, S.; Scholcz, A.; Amein, B.; Ganse-Dumrath, A.; Heslegrave, A.; Thompson, S.; Manohar, S. G.; Zetterberg, H.; Husain, M.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23293786\nA major limitation in current Alzheimers disease (AD) research is the lack of the ability to measure cognitive performance at scale--robustly, remotely, and frequently. For the purposes of screening, recruitment, stratification, and longitudinal follow-up in clinical trials, there are no established online digital platforms validated against plasma biomarkers of AD. Here we report findings using a novel web-based platform that assessed different cognitive functions in AD patients (N=46) and elderly controls (N=53) who were also assessed for plasma biomarkers of AD (amyloid {beta}42/40 ratio, pTau181, GFAP, NfL). Their performance was compared to a second, larger group of elderly controls (N=256). AD patients were significantly impaired across all digital cognitive tests, with performance correlating with plasma biomarker levels, particularly pTau181. These findings show how online testing can now be deployed in AD patients to measure cognitive function effectively and related to blood biomarkers of the disease.\nSynaptic inhibitory dynamics drive benzodiazepine response in paediatric status epilepticus\nAuthors: Fedele, T.; Burman, R. J.; Steinberg, A.; Selmin, G.; Ramantani, G.; Rosch, R.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294456\nPaediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.\nUncovering Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Corticothalamic Network during Seizures\nAuthors: Panchavati, S.; Daida, A.; Edmonds, B.; Miyakoshi, M.; Oana, S.; Ahn, S. S.; Arnold, C. D.; Salamon, N.; Sankar, R.; Fallah, A.; Speier, W.; Nariai, H.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294382\nObjectiveAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus (AN) and centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. This study aims to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci. MethodsWe analyzed ten patients (aged 2.7-28.1) with medication-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent stereotactic EEG evaluation with thalamic coverage. We examined both undirected and directed connectivity, incorporating coherence and spectral Granger causality analysis (GCA) between the diverse seizure foci and thalamic nuclei (AN and CM). ResultsIn our analysis of 36 seizures, coherence between seizure onset and thalamic nuclei increased across all frequencies, especially in slower bands (delta, theta, alpha). GCA showed increased information flow from seizure onset to the thalamus across all frequency bands, but outflows from the thalamus were mainly in slower frequencies, particularly delta. In the subgroup analysis based on various seizure foci, the delta coherence showed a more pronounced increase at CM than at AN during frontal lobe seizures. Conversely, in limbic seizures, the delta coherence increase was greater at AN compared to CM. InterpretationIt appears that the delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. Our results underscore the significance of comprehending the spatiotemporal dynamics of the corticothalamic network during seizures, and this knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies. Summary for Social MediaTwitter handles: @saarang_p; @BillSpeier What is the current knowledge on the topicAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. What question did this study addressThis study aimed to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci. What does this study add to our knowledgeThe delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. There are seizure-onset dependent spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network. How might this potentially impact on the practice of neurologyThis knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies.\nCOVID-19 Symptoms and Immunotherapy in People with Multiple Sclerosis: An Analysis of the COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative Dataset\nAuthors: Garcia-Dominguez, M. A.; Srichawla, B. S.; Kipkorir, V.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294509\nOBJECTIVESTo analyze the symptoms and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) on immunotherapy using data from the COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis (MS) Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset provided by PhysioNet. METHODSThe open-access COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset was obtained through credentialed access using PhysioNet. The variables analyzed included body mass index (BMI), symptoms of COVID-19, age, current use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT), efficacy of DMT, comorbidities, hospitalization status, and type of MS. A linear regression analysis was completed. Data analysis and visualization were completed using STATA v1.5, R-Studio v1.1.447, Python v3.8, and its associated libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. RESULTSA total of 1141 participants were included in the analysis. 904 women and 237 men were diagnosed with MS. Among the pwMS included in the study; 208 (19.54%) had a suspected infection with COVID-19 and only 49 (5.25%) were confirmed. Any COVID-19 symptom was present in 360 individuals. The commonly reported DMT agents included dimethyl fumarate (12.71%) and fingolimod (10.17%). 101 in total (8.85%) reported not using any DMT. Factors associated with hospitalization and/or admission to the ICU included having any comorbidity (p = 0.01), neuromuscular disorder (p = 0.046), hypertension (p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (p \u003c 0.001), and immunodeficiency (p = 0.003). The type of MS, the duration of the disease, and high-efficacy DMT therapy did not have a statistically significant influence on hospitalization. CONCLUSIONThis study underscores the importance of comorbidities, especially neuromuscular disorders, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and immunodeficiencies, as possible prognostic indicators for worse outcomes of COVID-19 in pwMS. On the contrary, the type of MS, the duration of the disease, and the efficacy of disease-modifying therapy did not significantly affect the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 in this cohort.\nLinking cortical lesions to metabolic changes in multiple sclerosis using 7T proton MR spectroscopy\nAuthors: Madsen, M. A. J.; Povazan, M.; Wiggermann, V.; Lundell, H.; Blinkenberg, M.; Christensen, J. R.; Sellebjerg, F.; Siebner, H. R.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294260\nImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex. DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T. SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020. ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2). ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI. Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel. ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean +/- standard deviation, 45.1 +/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 +/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 +/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 +/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 +/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 +/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups. ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels. Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis? Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume. Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.\nAssessing Clinical Progression Measures in Alzheimer's Disease Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: McLaughlin, J.; Scotton, W.; Hardy, J.; Shoai, M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294771\nClinical trials in Alzheimer disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression. In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}+) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs\nNeurostimulation in upper-limb amputees for suppression of phantom limb pain: changes in high-density EEG patterns\nAuthors: Kleeva, D.; Soghoyan, G.; Biktimirov, A.; Piliugin, N.; Matvienko, Y.; Sintsov, M.; Lebedev, M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.23294037\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.\nMicrosoft Bing vs Google Bard in Neurology: A Comparative Study of AI-Generated Patient Education Material\nAuthors: Nazir, T.; Mal, M.; Rehman, M. M.; Ahmad, U.; Saeed, R.; Kalia, J. S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294641\nBackground: Patient education is an essential component of healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as Google Bard and Microsoft Bing have the potential to improve information transmission and enhance patient care. However, it is crucial to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and understandability of the materials generated by these models before applying them in medical practice. This study aimed to assess and compare the quality of patient education materials produced by Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in response to questions related to neurological conditions. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate and compare the ability of Google Bard and Microsoft Bing to generate patient education materials. The study included the top ten prevalent neurological diseases based on WHO prevalence data. Ten board-certified neurologists and four neurology residents evaluated the responses generated by the models on six quality metrics. The scores for each model were compiled and averaged across all measures, and the significance of any observed variations was assessed using an independent t-test. Results: Google Bard performed better than Microsoft Bing in all six-quality metrics, with an overall mean score of 79% and 69%, respectively. Google Bard outperformed Microsoft Bing in all measures for eight questions, while Microsoft Bing performed marginally better in terms of objectivity and clarity for the epilepsy query. Conclusion: This study showed that Google Bard performs better than Microsoft Bing in generating patient education materials for neurological diseases. However, healthcare professionals should take into account both AI models' advantages and disadvantages when providing support for health information requirements. Future studies can help determine the underlying causes of these variations and guide cooperative initiatives to create more user-focused AI-generated patient education materials. Finally, researchers should consider the perception of patients regarding AI-generated patient education material and its impact on implementing these solutions in healthcare settings.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Vitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination.1 Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline.2,3,4 However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A major limitation in current Alzheimers disease (AD) research is the lack of the ability to measure cognitive performance at scale--robustly, remotely, and frequently. For the purposes of screening, recruitment, stratification, and longitudinal follow-up in clinical trials, there are no established online digital platforms validated against plasma biomarkers of AD. Here we report findings using a novel web-based platform that assessed different cognitive functions in AD patients (N=46) and elderly controls (N=53) who were also assessed for plasma biomarkers of AD (amyloid {beta}42/40 ratio, pTau181, GFAP, NfL). Their performance was compared to a second, larger group of elderly controls (N=256). AD patients were significantly impaired across all digital cognitive tests, with performance correlating with plasma biomarker levels, particularly pTau181. These findings show how online testing can now be deployed in AD patients to measure cognitive function effectively and related to blood biomarkers of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Paediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveAlthough the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus (AN) and centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus has been actively investigated for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy, few studies have investigated dynamic ictal changes in corticothalamic connectivity in human EEG recording. This study aims to establish the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the ictal corticothalamic network associated with various seizure foci.

MethodsWe analyzed ten patients (aged 2.7-28.1) with medication-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent stereotactic EEG evaluation with thalamic coverage. We examined both undirected and directed connectivity, incorporating coherence and spectral Granger causality analysis (GCA) between the diverse seizure foci and thalamic nuclei (AN and CM).

ResultsIn our analysis of 36 seizures, coherence between seizure onset and thalamic nuclei increased across all frequencies, especially in slower bands (delta, theta, alpha). GCA showed increased information flow from seizure onset to the thalamus across all frequency bands, but outflows from the thalamus were mainly in slower frequencies, particularly delta. In the subgroup analysis based on various seizure foci, the delta coherence showed a more pronounced increase at CM than at AN during frontal lobe seizures. Conversely, in limbic seizures, the delta coherence increase was greater at AN compared to CM.

InterpretationIt appears that the delta frequency plays a pivotal role in modulating the corticothalamic network during seizures. Our results underscore the significance of comprehending the spatiotemporal dynamics of the corticothalamic network during seizures, and this knowledge could guide personalized neuromodulation treatment strategies.

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVESTo analyze the symptoms and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) on immunotherapy using data from the COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis (MS) Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset provided by PhysioNet.

METHODSThe open-access COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative dataset was obtained through credentialed access using PhysioNet. The variables analyzed included body mass index (BMI), symptoms of COVID-19, age, current use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT), efficacy of DMT, comorbidities, hospitalization status, and type of MS. A linear regression analysis was completed. Data analysis and visualization were completed using STATA v1.5, R-Studio v1.1.447, Python v3.8, and its associated libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

RESULTSA total of 1141 participants were included in the analysis. 904 women and 237 men were diagnosed with MS. Among the pwMS included in the study; 208 (19.54%) had a suspected infection with COVID-19 and only 49 (5.25%) were confirmed. Any COVID-19 symptom was present in 360 individuals. The commonly reported DMT agents included dimethyl fumarate (12.71%) and fingolimod (10.17%). 101 in total (8.85%) reported not using any DMT. Factors associated with hospitalization and/or admission to the ICU included having any comorbidity (p = 0.01), neuromuscular disorder (p = 0.046), hypertension (p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (p &lt; 0.001), and immunodeficiency (p = 0.003). The type of MS, the duration of the disease, and high-efficacy DMT therapy did not have a statistically significant influence on hospitalization.

CONCLUSIONThis study underscores the importance of comorbidities, especially neuromuscular disorders, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and immunodeficiencies, as possible prognostic indicators for worse outcomes of COVID-19 in pwMS. On the contrary, the type of MS, the duration of the disease, and the efficacy of disease-modifying therapy did not significantly affect the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 in this cohort.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex.

DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T.

SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020.

ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2).

ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI.

Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel.

ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean &#43;/- standard deviation, 45.1 &#43;/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 &#43;/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 &#43;/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 &#43;/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 &#43;/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 &#43;/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups.

ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels.

Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis?

Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume.

Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical trials in Alzheimer disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression. In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}&#43;) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Patient education is an essential component of healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as Google Bard and Microsoft Bing have the potential to improve information transmission and enhance patient care. However, it is crucial to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and understandability of the materials generated by these models before applying them in medical practice. This study aimed to assess and compare the quality of patient education materials produced by Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in response to questions related to neurological conditions. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate and compare the ability of Google Bard and Microsoft Bing to generate patient education materials. The study included the top ten prevalent neurological diseases based on WHO prevalence data. Ten board-certified neurologists and four neurology residents evaluated the responses generated by the models on six quality metrics. The scores for each model were compiled and averaged across all measures, and the significance of any observed variations was assessed using an independent t-test. Results: Google Bard performed better than Microsoft Bing in all six-quality metrics, with an overall mean score of 79% and 69%, respectively. Google Bard outperformed Microsoft Bing in all measures for eight questions, while Microsoft Bing performed marginally better in terms of objectivity and clarity for the epilepsy query. Conclusion: This study showed that Google Bard performs better than Microsoft Bing in generating patient education materials for neurological diseases. However, healthcare professionals should take into account both AI models&#39; advantages and disadvantages when providing support for health information requirements. Future studies can help determine the underlying causes of these variations and guide cooperative initiatives to create more user-focused AI-generated patient education materials. Finally, researchers should consider the perception of patients regarding AI-generated patient education material and its impact on implementing these solutions in healthcare settings.</p>
