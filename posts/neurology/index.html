The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the \"clinico-radiological paradox\". The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables and lesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the \"clinico-radiological\" paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.\nValidation of remote collection and quantification of blood Neurofilament light in neurological diseases.\nAuthors: Coleman, A.; Touze, A.; Farag, M.; Pengo, M.; Murphy, M.

M.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299336\nPromising blood-based biomarkers of neuropathology have emerged with potential for therapeutic development and disease monitoring. However, these tools will require specialist tertiary services for integration into clinical management. Remote sampling for biomarker assessment could ease the burden of in-person clinical visits for such tests and allow for frequent sampling. Here we evaluated a capillary finger-prick collection for remote quantification of blood neurofilament light (NfL), a common blood-based biomarker evident in various neurological disorders, and other exploratory markers of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation (GFAP, tau). Matched samples from venepuncture and finger-prick were collected and processed into plasma and/or serum to directly compare NfL levels across four different neurological conditions (HD, MS, ALS, PD). Two delayed processing conditions were compared, three- and seven-day delay, simulating ambient shipment. Capillary NfL and GFAP concentrations were equivalent to those in venous blood serum and plasma. Only NfL remained stable after seven-day processing delay. Capillary NfL replicated disease group differences displayed in venous blood. This data supports our finger-prick method for remote collection and quantification of NfL. With the widespread applications for NfL across the spectrum of neurological disorders, this has the potential to transform disease monitoring, prognosis, and therapeutic development within clinical practice and research.

C.; Putcha, D.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298864\nIntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease. MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA. ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy. DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.\nNeuronal avalanches in temporal lobe epilepsy as a diagnostic tool: a noninvasive investigation of intrinsic resting state dynamics\nAuthors: Corsi, M.-C.; Lopez, E. T.; Sorrentino, P.; Danieli, A.; Cuozzo, S.; Bonanni, P.; Duma, G. M.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299589\nBackground and ObjectivesThe epilepsy diagnosis still represents a complex process, with misdiagnosis reaching 40%. Here, we aimed at building an automatable workflow, to help the clinicians in the diagnostic process, differentiating between controls and a population of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While primarily interested in correctly classifying the participants, we used data features providing hints on the underlying pathophysiological processes. Specifically, we hypothesized that neuronal avalanches (NA) may represent a feature that encapsulates the rich brain dynamics better than the classically used functional connectivity measures (Imaginary Coherence; ImCoh). MethodsWe recorded 10 minutes of resting state activity with high-density scalp electroencephalography (hdEEG; 128 channels). We analyzed large-scale activation bursts (NA) from source activation, to capture altered dynamics. Then, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify epilepsy patients vs. controls, and we described the goodness of the classification as well as the effect of the durations of the data segments on the performance. ResultsUsing a support vector machine (SVM), we reached a classification accuracy of 0.87 {+/-} 0.10 (SD) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 {+/-} 0.06. The use of avalanches-derived features, generated a mean increase of 16% in the accuracy of diagnosis prediction, compared to ImCoh. Investigating the main features informing the model, we observed that the dynamics of the entorhinal cortex, superior and inferior temporal gyri, cingulate cortex and prefrontal dorsolateral cortex were informing the model with NA. Finally, we studied the time-dependent accuracy in the classification. While the classification performance grows with the duration of the data length, there are specific lengths, at 30s and 180s at which the classification performance becomes steady, with intermediate lengths showing greater variability. Classification accuracy reached a plateau at 5 minutes of recording. DiscussionWe showed that NA represents a better EEG feature for an automated epilepsy identification, being related with neuronal dynamics of pathology-relevant brain areas. Furthermore, the presence of specific durations and the performance plateau might be interpreted as the manifestation of the specific intrinsic neuronal timescales altered in epilepsy. The study represents a potentially automatable and noninvasive workflow aiding the clinicians in the diagnosis.\nEvaluating Clinical Presentation and Long-Term Outcomes in Individuals with Genetic and Non-Genetic Epilepsy Treated with Epilepsy Surgery: A Single-Center Study\nAuthors: Ivaniuk, A.; Bosselmann, C.; Pestana-Knight, E.; Zhang, X.; Jehi, L.; Bingaman, W.; Najm, I.; Lal, D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299306\nBackgroundMany genetic epilepsy disorders are characterized by focal epilepsy or exhibit focal or lateralized features, which make individuals with such conditions potential surgical candidates. However, surgical outcomes in epilepsy caused by germline genetic variants and value of genetic testing in presurgical assessment remains unclear. MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study included people with germline genetic epilepsy and non-genetic epilepsy identified among 2879 people with epilepsy who underwent resective surgery or laser ablation at Cleveland Clinic in years 1997-2022. We separated individuals with germline genetic epilepsies into mTORopathies (clinically or genetically diagnosed tuberous sclerosis and genetically diagnosed GATOR-related epilepsies) and other genetic etiologies. We compared clinical variables between the groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher tests as appropriate. We analyzed cumulative seizure recurrence risk over 5 years with Kaplan-Meier curves and used Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analysis. We repeated the analysis after matching both genetic sub-groups to non-genetic group 1:1 by propensity scores estimated by a generalized linear model. ResultsWe included 49 individuals with genetic epilepsies (32 individuals with mTORopathies and 17 individuals with other genetic etiologies) and 585 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy. Individuals with genetic epilepsies in both groups were younger at seizure onset (p\u003c0.001) and at surgery (p\u003c0.001), had a higher preoperative seizure frequency (p\u003c0.001), higher rate of developmental delay (p\u003c0.001), lower rate of focal interictal (p=0.005) and ictal (p\u003c0.001) findings on EEG, and more extratemporal and extensive resections (p\u003c0.001). At the last follow-up, individuals with other genetic etiologies had a lower rate of seizure freedom than individuals with mTORopathies and non-genetic etiologies; still, 70.6% achieved seizure reduction. Individuals with other genetic etiologies had a higher cumulative risk of seizure recurrence at 5 years both in univariate (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.4-6.74) and multivariate (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.69-8.62, p=0.001) analyses, which was reproducible in a matched cohort analysis. ConclusionsPeople with germline genetic epilepsy across multiple etiologies could be surgical candidates. However, seizure recurrence may be faster in genetic epilepsies other than mTORopathies. Further studies are required to clarify surgical candidacy in different genetic epilepsy disorders and establish value of presurgical genetic testing.\nImaging Drug Resistance in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy with MRI-derived Cortical Markers\nAuthors: Crespo Pimentel, B.; Kuchukhidze, G.; Xiao, F.; Caciagli, L.; Hoefler, J.; Rainer, L.; Kronbichler, M.; Vollmar, C.; Trinka, E.; Koepp, M.; Wandschneider, B.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23298783\nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is no longer considered a benign condition and can present a significant challenge due to lack of seizure control and concomitant neuropsychological impairment. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. MRI studies have described structural changes in individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) syndromes but have so far failed to identify a distinct structural profile associated with drug resistant IGE. In this cross-sectional case-control neuroimaging analysis we included 79 participants with JME recruited at two European epilepsy centres, 43 of whom were drug resistant, as defined by recurrent seizures in the last 12 months despite adequate trials of at least two antiseizure medications (ASM), a drug sensitive group (n = 37), and 78 healthy controls. Participants underwent T1-weighted MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including measures within two different domains: verbal memory and executive function. We performed vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness and neurodevelopmental cortical measures, i.e. white matter surface area and local gyrification index (LGI), through a surface-based framework with subsequent correction of scanner-related effects. Group comparisons (family-wise error (FWE) corrected at pFWE \u003c0.05) showed an increase of surface area in prefrontal, cingulate and temporal regions with left-sided predominance accompanied by increased LGI in the left temporal lobe in drug-resistant compared to drug-responsive individuals with JME. Performance on executive function in participants with drug resistant JME was reduced compared to drug sensitive JME (pBonferroni \u003c0.01) and controls (pBonferroni \u003c0.001). Impaired executive function correlated with increased surface area in medial prefrontal and temporal cortical regions (r \u003c -0.75, p \u003c0.01) after adjusting for disease duration and total ASM load. In conclusion, we identified a cognitive-developmental profile in drug resistant JME characterized by left-weighted changes in surface area and cortical folding complexity, the extent of which correlates with the degree of executive dysfunction. Our results shed further light onto the pathophysiological mechanisms of JME and suggest a neurodevelopmental/network basis for both drug refractoriness and cognitive impairment.\nA limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome associated with TDP-43 pathology\nAuthors: Corriveau-Lecavalier, N.; Botha, H.; Graff-Radford, J.; Switzer, A. R.; Przybelski, S. A.; Wiste, H. J.; Murray, M. E.; Reichard, R. R.; Dickson, D. W.; Nguyen, A.; Ramanan, V.; McCarter, S. J.; Boeve, B. F.; Machulda, M. M.; Fields, J. A.; Stricker, N. S.; Nelson, P. T.; Grothe, M. J.; Knopman, D. S.; Lowe, V. J.; Petersen, R. C.; Jack, C. R.; Jones, D. T.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.23298314\nLimbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, the presence of structural MRI lesions, and a &#34;no better explanation&#34; criterion. The structural lesions, disseminated in time and space, are a consequence of autoimmune processes leading to the damage of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. As such, one would expect that more lesions would relate to higher clinical disability. However, a conflicting scenario is often present, with a high lesion load related to mild clinical impairment, and vice versa, a phenomenon referred to as the &#34;clinico-radiological paradox&#34;. The myelin damage in MS is widespread, which is likely mirrored in a widespread slowing of conduction velocities. However, conduction velocities are typically measured on selected white-matter tracts (e.g., visual evoked potentials), which do not directly relate to clinical impairment. In this paper, we hypothesize that the overall slowing of conduction velocities (i.e., across all brain tracts) is a better predictor of clinical disability. However, estimating the whole-brain average velocities is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we estimated patient-specific conduction velocities in MS patients by merging multimodal data (i.e., DTI and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography) to inform large-scale brain models, fitted on each individual patient. We started from the known reduction of the power of the alpha frequency band, as well as the shift in its peak, observed in MS patients. We then reproduced these individual spectral features in silico using large-scale models based on the individual connectomes. We then used state-of-the-art deep neural networks for Bayesian model inversion to estimate the most likely average conduction velocity in each patient, given the observed spectral features (and the connectomes). Finally, we used the inferred conduction velocities to predict the individual clinical disability. We find that the conduction velocities inferred for patients are significantly lower than those inferred for controls and that they are predictive of individual clinical disability, well above the predictive power of demographic and clinical variables and lesion load. Our results suggest a biologically and physically plausible solution to the &#34;clinico-radiological&#34; paradox, where the inferred, individual changes in conduction velocities across the whole networks are proposed as causative to the clinical disability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Promising blood-based biomarkers of neuropathology have emerged with potential for therapeutic development and disease monitoring. However, these tools will require specialist tertiary services for integration into clinical management. Remote sampling for biomarker assessment could ease the burden of in-person clinical visits for such tests and allow for frequent sampling. Here we evaluated a capillary finger-prick collection for remote quantification of blood neurofilament light (NfL), a common blood-based biomarker evident in various neurological disorders, and other exploratory markers of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation (GFAP, tau).

Matched samples from venepuncture and finger-prick were collected and processed into plasma and/or serum to directly compare NfL levels across four different neurological conditions (HD, MS, ALS, PD). Two delayed processing conditions were compared, three- and seven-day delay, simulating ambient shipment.

Capillary NfL and GFAP concentrations were equivalent to those in venous blood serum and plasma. Only NfL remained stable after seven-day processing delay. Capillary NfL replicated disease group differences displayed in venous blood.

This data supports our finger-prick method for remote collection and quantification of NfL. With the widespread applications for NfL across the spectrum of neurological disorders, this has the potential to transform disease monitoring, prognosis, and therapeutic development within clinical practice and research.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPosterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in higher-order visuospatial processing, leading to symptoms such as space perception deficit, simultanagnosia, and object perception impairment. While PCA is primarily known for its impact on visuospatial abilities, recent studies have documented language abnormalities in PCA patients. This study aims to delineate the nature and origin of language impairments in PCA, hypothesizing that language deficits reflect the visuospatial processing impairments of the disease.

MethodsWe compared the language samples of 25 patients with PCA with age-matched cognitively normal (CN) individuals across two distinct tasks: a visually-dependent picture description and a visually-independent job description task. We extracted word frequency, word utterance latency, and spatial relational words for this comparison. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of the language used in the picture description task to identify specific linguistic indicators that reflect the visuospatial processing deficits of PCA.

ResultsPatients with PCA showed significant language deficits in the visually-dependent task, characterized by higher word frequency, prolonged utterance latency, and fewer spatial relational words, but not in the visually-independent task. An in-depth analysis of the picture description task further showed that PCA patients struggled to identify certain visual elements as well as the overall theme of the picture. A predictive model based on these language features distinguished PCA patients from CN individuals with high classification accuracy.

DiscussionThe findings indicate that language is a sensitive behavioral construct to detect visuospatial processing abnormalities of PCA. These insights offer theoretical and clinical avenues for understanding and managing PCA, underscoring language as a crucial marker for the visuospatial deficits of this atypical variant of Alzheimers disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectivesThe epilepsy diagnosis still represents a complex process, with misdiagnosis reaching 40%. Here, we aimed at building an automatable workflow, to help the clinicians in the diagnostic process, differentiating between controls and a population of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While primarily interested in correctly classifying the participants, we used data features providing hints on the underlying pathophysiological processes. Specifically, we hypothesized that neuronal avalanches (NA) may represent a feature that encapsulates the rich brain dynamics better than the classically used functional connectivity measures (Imaginary Coherence; ImCoh).

MethodsWe recorded 10 minutes of resting state activity with high-density scalp electroencephalography (hdEEG; 128 channels). We analyzed large-scale activation bursts (NA) from source activation, to capture altered dynamics. Then, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify epilepsy patients vs. controls, and we described the goodness of the classification as well as the effect of the durations of the data segments on the performance.

ResultsUsing a support vector machine (SVM), we reached a classification accuracy of 0.87 {&#43;/-} 0.10 (SD) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 {&#43;/-} 0.06. The use of avalanches-derived features, generated a mean increase of 16% in the accuracy of diagnosis prediction, compared to ImCoh. Investigating the main features informing the model, we observed that the dynamics of the entorhinal cortex, superior and inferior temporal gyri, cingulate cortex and prefrontal dorsolateral cortex were informing the model with NA. Finally, we studied the time-dependent accuracy in the classification. While the classification performance grows with the duration of the data length, there are specific lengths, at 30s and 180s at which the classification performance becomes steady, with intermediate lengths showing greater variability. Classification accuracy reached a plateau at 5 minutes of recording.

DiscussionWe showed that NA represents a better EEG feature for an automated epilepsy identification, being related with neuronal dynamics of pathology-relevant brain areas. Furthermore, the presence of specific durations and the performance plateau might be interpreted as the manifestation of the specific intrinsic neuronal timescales altered in epilepsy. The study represents a potentially automatable and noninvasive workflow aiding the clinicians in the diagnosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMany genetic epilepsy disorders are characterized by focal epilepsy or exhibit focal or lateralized features, which make individuals with such conditions potential surgical candidates. However, surgical outcomes in epilepsy caused by germline genetic variants and value of genetic testing in presurgical assessment remains unclear.

MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study included people with germline genetic epilepsy and non-genetic epilepsy identified among 2879 people with epilepsy who underwent resective surgery or laser ablation at Cleveland Clinic in years 1997-2022. We separated individuals with germline genetic epilepsies into mTORopathies (clinically or genetically diagnosed tuberous sclerosis and genetically diagnosed GATOR-related epilepsies) and other genetic etiologies. We compared clinical variables between the groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher tests as appropriate. We analyzed cumulative seizure recurrence risk over 5 years with Kaplan-Meier curves and used Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analysis. We repeated the analysis after matching both genetic sub-groups to non-genetic group 1:1 by propensity scores estimated by a generalized linear model.

ResultsWe included 49 individuals with genetic epilepsies (32 individuals with mTORopathies and 17 individuals with other genetic etiologies) and 585 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy. Individuals with genetic epilepsies in both groups were younger at seizure onset (p&lt;0.001) and at surgery (p&lt;0.001), had a higher preoperative seizure frequency (p&lt;0.001), higher rate of developmental delay (p&lt;0.001), lower rate of focal interictal (p=0.005) and ictal (p&lt;0.001) findings on EEG, and more extratemporal and extensive resections (p&lt;0.001). At the last follow-up, individuals with other genetic etiologies had a lower rate of seizure freedom than individuals with mTORopathies and non-genetic etiologies; still, 70.6% achieved seizure reduction. Individuals with other genetic etiologies had a higher cumulative risk of seizure recurrence at 5 years both in univariate (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.4-6.74) and multivariate (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.69-8.62, p=0.001) analyses, which was reproducible in a matched cohort analysis.

ConclusionsPeople with germline genetic epilepsy across multiple etiologies could be surgical candidates. However, seizure recurrence may be faster in genetic epilepsies other than mTORopathies. Further studies are required to clarify surgical candidacy in different genetic epilepsy disorders and establish value of presurgical genetic testing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is no longer considered a benign condition and can present a significant challenge due to lack of seizure control and concomitant neuropsychological impairment. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. MRI studies have described structural changes in individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) syndromes but have so far failed to identify a distinct structural profile associated with drug resistant IGE. In this cross-sectional case-control neuroimaging analysis we included 79 participants with JME recruited at two European epilepsy centres, 43 of whom were drug resistant, as defined by recurrent seizures in the last 12 months despite adequate trials of at least two antiseizure medications (ASM), a drug sensitive group (n = 37), and 78 healthy controls. Participants underwent T1-weighted MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including measures within two different domains: verbal memory and executive function. We performed vertex-wise measurements of cortical thickness and neurodevelopmental cortical measures, i.e. white matter surface area and local gyrification index (LGI), through a surface-based framework with subsequent correction of scanner-related effects. Group comparisons (family-wise error (FWE) corrected at pFWE &lt;0.05) showed an increase of surface area in prefrontal, cingulate and temporal regions with left-sided predominance accompanied by increased LGI in the left temporal lobe in drug-resistant compared to drug-responsive individuals with JME. Performance on executive function in participants with drug resistant JME was reduced compared to drug sensitive JME (pBonferroni &lt;0.01) and controls (pBonferroni &lt;0.001). Impaired executive function correlated with increased surface area in medial prefrontal and temporal cortical regions (r &lt; -0.75, p &lt;0.01) after adjusting for disease duration and total ASM load. In conclusion, we identified a cognitive-developmental profile in drug resistant JME characterized by left-weighted changes in surface area and cortical folding complexity, the extent of which correlates with the degree of executive dysfunction. Our results shed further light onto the pathophysiological mechanisms of JME and suggest a neurodevelopmental/network basis for both drug refractoriness and cognitive impairment.</p>

When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem diagnoses of LATE.</p>
