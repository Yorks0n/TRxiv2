Knockdown of this allele may provide a therapeutic strategy for AD, but the effect of APOE loss-of-function (LoF) on AD pathogenesis is unknown. We searched for APOE LoF variants in a large cohort of older controls and patients with AD and identified six heterozygote carriers of APOE LoF variants. Five carriers were controls (ages 71-90) and one was an AD case with an unremarkable age-at-onset between 75-79. Two APOE {epsilon}3/{epsilon}4 controls (Subjects 1 and 2) carried a stop-gain affecting the {epsilon}4 allele. Subject 1 was cognitively normal at 90+ and had no neuritic plaques at autopsy. Subject 2 was cognitively healthy within the age range 75-79 and underwent lumbar puncture at between ages 75-79 with normal levels of amyloid. The results provide the strongest human genetics evidence yet available suggesting that {epsilon}4 drives AD risk through a gain of abnormal function and support knockdown of APOE {epsilon}4 or its protein product as a viable therapeutic option.\nA 3' UTR Deletion Is a Leading Candidate Causal Variant at the TMEM106B Locus Reducing Risk for FTLD-TDP\nAuthors: Chemparathy, A.; Le Guen, Y.; Zeng, Y.; Gorzynski, J.; Jensen, T.; Kasireddy, N.; Talozzi, L.; Belloy, M. E.; Stewart, I.; Gitler, A. D.; Wagner, A. D.; Mormino, E.; Henderson, V. W.; Wyss-Coray, T.; Ashley, E.; Greicius, M. D.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292312\nSingle nucleotide variants (SNVs) near TMEM106B have been associated with risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP pathology (FTLD-TDP) but the causal variant at this locus has not yet been isolated. The initial leading FTLD-TDP genome-wide association study (GWAS) hit at this locus, rs1990622, is intergenic and is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a TMEM106B coding SNV, rs3173615. We developed a long-read sequencing (LRS) dataset of 407 individuals in order to identify structural variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a prevalent 322 base pair deletion on the TMEM106B 3 untranslated region (UTR) that was in perfect linkage with rs1990622 and near-perfect linkage with rs3173615 (genotype discordance in two of 274 individuals who had LRS and short-read next-generation sequencing). In Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) participants, this deletion was in greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.920916, D=0.963472) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.883776, D=0.963575). rs1990622 and rs3173615 are less closely linked (R2=0.7403, D=0.9915) in African populations. Among African ancestry individuals in the ADSP, the deletion is in even greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.936841, D=0.976782) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.764242, D=0.974406). Querying publicly available genetic datasets with associated mRNA expression and protein levels, we confirmed that rs1990622 is consistently a protein quantitative trait locus but not an expression quantitative trait locus, consistent with a causal variant present on the TMEM106B 3UTR. In summary, the TMEM106B 3 UTR deletion is a large genetic variant on the TMEM106B transcript that is in higher LD with the leading GWAS hit rs1990622 than rs3173615 and may mediate the protective effect of this locus in neurodegenerative disease.\nBrain mechanisms explaining postural imbalance in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review\nAuthors: Hadi, Z.; Mahmud, M.; Seemungal, B. M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.23292709\nPersisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG. The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction. In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.\n",

Among African ancestry individuals in the ADSP, the deletion is in even greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.936841, D=0.976782) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.764242, D=0.974406). Querying publicly available genetic datasets with associated mRNA expression and protein levels, we confirmed that rs1990622 is consistently a protein quantitative trait locus but not an expression quantitative trait locus, consistent with a causal variant present on the TMEM106B 3UTR. In summary, the TMEM106B 3 UTR deletion is a large genetic variant on the TMEM106B transcript that is in higher LD with the leading GWAS hit rs1990622 than rs3173615 and may mediate the protective effect of this locus in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Persisting imbalance and falls in community-dwelling traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors - typically related to vestibular dysfunction - are linked to reduced long-term survival and re-employment rates. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of TBI upon the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance is lacking. To understand the state of the art concerning the brain mechanisms mediating imbalance in TBI, we performed a systematic review of the literature.

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched and peer-reviewed research articles in humans, with any severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, or concussion), that linked a postural balance assessment (objective or subjective) with brain imaging (via CT, MRI, MRS, SPECT, EEG, MEG, NIRS, and evoked potentials) were included. Out of 1940 articles, 60 were retrieved and screened, and 25 were included in the systematic review. 17 of those were MRI-based studies (e.g., DTI, fMRI), 4 EEG studies, 3 fNIRS studies, and 1 study used both MRI and EEG.

The most consistent MRI finding was the link between imbalance and cerebellum, however, the regions within the cerebellum were not consistent. Functional changes in EEG studies were non-specific as all frequency bands were reportedly linked with balance. The findings from fNIRS studies were concentrated in frontal regions as these studies only used ROI analysis. Notably, only one study reported performing clinical vestibular assessment to exclude peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

In conclusion, the lack of consistent findings could reflect that imbalance in TBI is due to a brain network dysfunction in contrast to focal cortical damage. Notably, the inconsistency in the reported findings may be attributed to heterogeneity of methodology e.g., data analytical techniques, small sample sizes, and choice of control groups. Future studies should include a detailed clinical phenotyping of vestibular function in TBI patients, ideally in an acute prospective manner, to exclude peripheral disorders. Choosing the appropriate control groups (i.e., well characterized patient subgroups as controls) would ensure that the findings are specific to imbalance rather than being non-specifically linked to TBI. Moreover, a whole-brain imaging analysis (vs ROI) is recommended to reduce selection bias and is also important since TBI affects the brain in a widespread manner.</p>
