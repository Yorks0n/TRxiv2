J.; Delis, I.; Brown, C.; Sivan, M.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298171\nLong COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.\nLexical Markers of Disordered Speech in Primary Progressive Aphasia and Parkinson-plus Disorders\nAuthors: Henderson, S. K.; Ramanan, S.; Patterson, K. E.; Garrard, P.; Patel, N.; Peterson, K. E.; Halai, A.; Cappa, S. F.; Rowe, J. B.; Lambon Ralph, M. A.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.23298112\nConnected speech samples elicited by a picture description task are widely used in the assessment of aphasias, but it is not clear what their interpretation should focus on. Although such samples are easy to collect, analyses of them tend to be time-consuming, inconsistently conducted, and impractical for non-specialist settings. Here, we analysed connected speech samples from patients with the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA N = 9, lvPPA N = 9, nfvPPA N = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP Richardson's syndrome N = 10), corticobasal syndrome (CBS N = 13), and age-matched healthy controls. There were three principal aims. First, to determine the differences in quantitative language output and psycholinguistic properties of words produced by patients and controls. Second, to identify the neural correlates of connected speech measures. Third, to develop a simple clinical measurement tool: using data-driven methods, we optimised a 15-word checklist for use with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination cookie theft and Mini Linguistic Aphasia Examination beach scene pictures and tested the predictive validity of outputs from Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models using an independent clinical sample from a second site. The total language output was significantly reduced in patients with nfvPPA, PSP and CBS relative to those with svPPA and controls. Patients with lvPPA and svPPA were found to use a disproportionately greater use of words that were more frequent and semantically diverse. Results from voxel-based morphometry analyses across the whole group revealed correlations between grey matter volume in (i) bilateral frontal lobes with overall language output, (ii) the left frontal and superior temporal regions with speech complexity, (iii) bilateral frontotemporal regions with phonology, and (iv) bilateral cingulate and subcortical regions with age of acquisition. With the 15-word checklists, the LASSO models showed excellent accuracy for within-sample k-fold classification (over 95%) and out-of-sample validation between patients and controls (over 90%), and moderately good (59% - 70%) differentiation between the motor disorders (nfvPPA, PSP, CBS) and lexico-semantic groups (svPPA, lvPPA). In conclusion, we propose that a simple 15-word checklist provides a suitable screening test to identify people with progressive aphasia, while further specialist assessment is likely to be needed to differentiate accurately some groups (e.g., svPPA versus lvPPA and PSP versus CBS).\nExploring the local field potential signal from the subthalamic nucleus for phase-targeted auditory stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Krugliakova, E.; Karpovich, A.; Stieglitz, L.; Huwiler, S.; Lustenberger, C.; Imbach, L.; Bujan, B.; Jedrysiak, P.; Jacomet, M.; Baumann, C. R.; Fattinger, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297547\nBackgroundEnhancing slow waves, the electrophysiological (EEG) manifestation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, might offer therapeutic benefits for patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) by improving sleep quality and slowing disease progression. Phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) is an approach to enhance slow waves, which are detected in the surface EEG signal in real-time. ObjectiveWe aimed to test whether the local-field potential of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-LFP) can be used to detect frontal slow waves and evaluate the PTAS-related electrophysiologic changes. MethodsWe enrolled patients diagnosed with PD and undergoing Percept PC neurostimulator (Medtronic) implantation for the deep brain stimulation of STN (STN-DBS) in a two-step surgery. Patients participated in 3 full-night recordings, including one between-surgeries recording and two recordings during rehabilitation, one with DBS+ (on) and one with DBS-(off). Surface EEG and STN-LFP signals from Percept PC were recorded simultaneously, and PTAS was applied during sleep in all three recording sessions. ResultsOur results show that during NREM sleep, slow waves of the cortex and STN are time-locked. We observed the effects of PTAS in STN-LFP in all types of analyses, including spectral, coherence, and event-related potentials. ConclusionOur findings suggest that PTAS could be implemented using STN-LFP signal for slow wave detection. Additionally, we propose options for better STN-LFP signal preprocessing, including different referencing and filtering that could make the detection of the cortical slow waves in STN-LFP more reliable.\nHabitual and supplemented prebiotic diets and their links to inflammatory serum markers and hypothalamic microstructure in young, overweight adults: a pre-registered study.\nAuthors: Toews, E.; Medawar, E.; Thieleking, R.; Beyer, F.; Stumvoll, M.; Villringer, A.; Witte, V.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297892\nBackgroundPrebiotic dietary fiber and related metabolites have been suggested to attenuate low-grade systemic and central inflammation through improving gut-brain axis signaling. We here aimed to test whether habitual or short-term high-dose fiber intake is linked to inflammatory markers in blood and to indicators of central hypothalamic inflammation. MethodsIn total, 59 adults (19 women, aged 28.3 years {+/-} 6.6 SD, mean body mass index, BMI, 27.3 {+/-} 1.5 SD) were included into analyses. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla for provision of mean diffusivity (MD) as a marker of brain tissue inflammation and donated fasting blood. Measurements took place at up to 4 timepoints, i.e. before and after 14 days of supplementary fiber and placebo intake, respectively. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL6) were assessed in serum. The study was preregistered at https://osf.io/uzbav. ResultsHabitual and interventional high-fiber diet was not significantly associated with neither inflammatory markers (|{beta}intervention|\u003e 0.1, p \u003e 0.32) nor with hypothalamic MD (|{beta}intervention| = 1.8, p = 0.07) according to linear mixed effects modeling. Male sex and higher body fat mass related to higher CRP. Further, higher BMI was borderline related to lower hypothalamic MD. ConclusionsIn this sample of overweight adults, dietary fiber intake was not related to inflammatory blood markers or hypothalamic microstructure. Instead, sex and body composition were of higher importance for prediction of interindividual differences in markers of (neuro)inflammation. Significance StatementPrebiotic dietary fiber has been discussed to lower systemic and central inflammation. While previous studies investigated the effects of fiber on inflammatory blood markers, the knowledge of the effect of fiber on neuroinflammation is limited. Thus, in this pre-registered randomized controlled trial analysis we examined the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory markers in blood and hypothalamus. 3T MRI and blood markers were assessed before and after high-fiber intake and placebo in 59 adults. In our overweight study sample of 19-42 years old adults, fiber intake had no significant impact on inflammatory markers. The current null findings can inform future nutrition neuroimaging trials and add to the discussion about how diet may affect brain structure and function.\nPathways linking pulse pressure to dementia in adults with Down syndrome\nAuthors: Rizvi, B.; Lao, P. J.; Sathishkumar, M.; Taylor, L.; Queder, N.; McMillan, L.; Edwards, N.; Keator, D. B.; Doran, E.; Hom, C.; Nguyen, D.; Rosas, H. D.; Lai, F.; Schupf, N.; Guiterrez, J.; Silverman, W.; Lott, I. T.; Mapstone, M.; Wilcock, D. M.; Head, E.; Yassa, M. A.; Brickman, A. M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297625\nIndividuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{+/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.\nMultiple Sclerosis in the Digital Health Age: Challenges and Opportunities - A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Specht, B.; Jager, H.; Garbaya, S.; Pincherle, A.; Sarvari, P. A.; Khadraoui, D.; Schneider, R.; Chavarriaga, R.; TAYEB, Z.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.23298084\nIn recent times, we have unequivocally witnessed a push towards digitising the healthcare system. Topics such as remote patient monitoring (RPM), digital health, and their use to monitor neurological disease progression have gained momentum and popularity. Notwithstanding the considerable advances that have been made in adopting such technologies and using them in the context of mental health or even a few neurodegenerative disease monitoring, they have not been widely used in the context of remote management and treatment of multiple sclerosis MS. In the same vein, given that (MS) is a very individualized disease to manage, there are numerous challenges yet opportunities associated with using digital health technologies for remote MS monitoring. This paper reviews the different research work and clinical attempts performed over the last decade (both home \u0026 hospital-based monitoring) en route to using digital health for MS monitoring and management. Similarly, this systematic review discusses the main challenges and barriers to translating that research from clinics into homes and highlights the opportunities in that context. Throughout this extensive review, we shine a light on various monitoring methods that hold the potential to be measured in a home environment, including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (e.g., motor evoked potential (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and visual evoked potential (VEP)), electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and speech analysis. Combining such digital biomarkers could pave the way for developing a more personalised treatment for MS patients, thereby stopping its progression and avoiding silent MS disability. Adopting digital health for remote monitoring and management could also chart a route ahead for a new era of personalised medicine for MS patients and potentially other brain disorder patients.\nAn efficient design for whole genome trio sequencing identifies key variants in rare neurological disorder cases\nAuthors: Ramsey, K.; Kruglyak, S.; Naymik, M.; Lajoie, B. R.; Wiseman, K. N.; Sanchez-Castillo, M.; Billings, S.; Jepsen, W.; Huentelman, M.; Narayanan, V.\nScore: 524.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296768\nWe sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Long COVID (LC) is a multisymptom clinical syndrome with similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). All these conditions are believed to be associated with centrally driven mechanisms such as central sensitisation. There is a lack of consensus on quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes observed in these conditions. This review aims to synthesise and appraise the literature on resting-state qEEG in LC, FMS and CFS/ME, to help uncover possible mechanisms of central sensitisation in these similar clinical syndromes. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for articles published between December 1994 and September 2023 was performed. Following screening for predetermined selection criteria and out of the initial 2510 studies identified, 17 articles were retrieved that met all the inclusion criteria, particularly of assessing qEEG changes in one of the three conditions compared to healthy controls. All studies scored moderate to high quality on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. There was a general trend for decreased low-frequency EEG band activity (delta, theta, and alpha) and increased high-frequency EEG beta activity in FMS, whereas an opposite trend was found in CFS/ME. The limited LC studies included in this review focused mainly on cognitive impairments and showed mixed findings not consistent with patterns seen in FMS and CFS/ME. Further research is required to explore whether there are phenotypes within LC that have EEG signatures similar to FMS or CFS/ME. This could inform identification of reliable diagnostic markers and possible targets for neuromodulation therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connected speech samples elicited by a picture description task are widely used in the assessment of aphasias, but it is not clear what their interpretation should focus on. Although such samples are easy to collect, analyses of them tend to be time-consuming, inconsistently conducted, and impractical for non-specialist settings. Here, we analysed connected speech samples from patients with the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA N = 9, lvPPA N = 9, nfvPPA N = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP Richardson&#39;s syndrome N = 10), corticobasal syndrome (CBS N = 13), and age-matched healthy controls. There were three principal aims. First, to determine the differences in quantitative language output and psycholinguistic properties of words produced by patients and controls. Second, to identify the neural correlates of connected speech measures. Third, to develop a simple clinical measurement tool: using data-driven methods, we optimised a 15-word checklist for use with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination cookie theft and Mini Linguistic Aphasia Examination beach scene pictures and tested the predictive validity of outputs from Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models using an independent clinical sample from a second site. The total language output was significantly reduced in patients with nfvPPA, PSP and CBS relative to those with svPPA and controls. Patients with lvPPA and svPPA were found to use a disproportionately greater use of words that were more frequent and semantically diverse. Results from voxel-based morphometry analyses across the whole group revealed correlations between grey matter volume in (i) bilateral frontal lobes with overall language output, (ii) the left frontal and superior temporal regions with speech complexity, (iii) bilateral frontotemporal regions with phonology, and (iv) bilateral cingulate and subcortical regions with age of acquisition. With the 15-word checklists, the LASSO models showed excellent accuracy for within-sample k-fold classification (over 95%) and out-of-sample validation between patients and controls (over 90%), and moderately good (59% - 70%) differentiation between the motor disorders (nfvPPA, PSP, CBS) and lexico-semantic groups (svPPA, lvPPA). In conclusion, we propose that a simple 15-word checklist provides a suitable screening test to identify people with progressive aphasia, while further specialist assessment is likely to be needed to differentiate accurately some groups (e.g., svPPA versus lvPPA and PSP versus CBS).</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEnhancing slow waves, the electrophysiological (EEG) manifestation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, might offer therapeutic benefits for patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) by improving sleep quality and slowing disease progression. Phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) is an approach to enhance slow waves, which are detected in the surface EEG signal in real-time.

ObjectiveWe aimed to test whether the local-field potential of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-LFP) can be used to detect frontal slow waves and evaluate the PTAS-related electrophysiologic changes.

MethodsWe enrolled patients diagnosed with PD and undergoing Percept PC neurostimulator (Medtronic) implantation for the deep brain stimulation of STN (STN-DBS) in a two-step surgery. Patients participated in 3 full-night recordings, including one between-surgeries recording and two recordings during rehabilitation, one with DBS&#43; (on) and one with DBS-(off). Surface EEG and STN-LFP signals from Percept PC were recorded simultaneously, and PTAS was applied during sleep in all three recording sessions.

ResultsOur results show that during NREM sleep, slow waves of the cortex and STN are time-locked. We observed the effects of PTAS in STN-LFP in all types of analyses, including spectral, coherence, and event-related potentials.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that PTAS could be implemented using STN-LFP signal for slow wave detection. Additionally, we propose options for better STN-LFP signal preprocessing, including different referencing and filtering that could make the detection of the cortical slow waves in STN-LFP more reliable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrebiotic dietary fiber and related metabolites have been suggested to attenuate low-grade systemic and central inflammation through improving gut-brain axis signaling. We here aimed to test whether habitual or short-term high-dose fiber intake is linked to inflammatory markers in blood and to indicators of central hypothalamic inflammation.

MethodsIn total, 59 adults (19 women, aged 28.3 years {&#43;/-} 6.6 SD, mean body mass index, BMI, 27.3 {&#43;/-} 1.5 SD) were included into analyses. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla for provision of mean diffusivity (MD) as a marker of brain tissue inflammation and donated fasting blood. Measurements took place at up to 4 timepoints, i.e. before and after 14 days of supplementary fiber and placebo intake, respectively. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL6) were assessed in serum. The study was preregistered at https://osf.io/uzbav.

ResultsHabitual and interventional high-fiber diet was not significantly associated with neither inflammatory markers (|{beta}intervention|&gt; 0.1, p &gt; 0.32) nor with hypothalamic MD (|{beta}intervention| = 1.8, p = 0.07) according to linear mixed effects modeling. Male sex and higher body fat mass related to higher CRP. Further, higher BMI was borderline related to lower hypothalamic MD.

ConclusionsIn this sample of overweight adults, dietary fiber intake was not related to inflammatory blood markers or hypothalamic microstructure. Instead, sex and body composition were of higher importance for prediction of interindividual differences in markers of (neuro)inflammation.

Significance StatementPrebiotic dietary fiber has been discussed to lower systemic and central inflammation. While previous studies investigated the effects of fiber on inflammatory blood markers, the knowledge of the effect of fiber on neuroinflammation is limited. Thus, in this pre-registered randomized controlled trial analysis we examined the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory markers in blood and hypothalamus. 3T MRI and blood markers were assessed before and after high-fiber intake and placebo in 59 adults. In our overweight study sample of 19-42 years old adults, fiber intake had no significant impact on inflammatory markers. The current null findings can inform future nutrition neuroimaging trials and add to the discussion about how diet may affect brain structure and function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6{&#43;/-}7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent times, we have unequivocally witnessed a push towards digitising the healthcare system. Topics such as remote patient monitoring (RPM), digital health, and their use to monitor neurological disease progression have gained momentum and popularity. Notwithstanding the considerable advances that have been made in adopting such technologies and using them in the context of mental health or even a few neurodegenerative disease monitoring, they have not been widely used in the context of remote management and treatment of multiple sclerosis MS. In the same vein, given that (MS) is a very individualized disease to manage, there are numerous challenges yet opportunities associated with using digital health technologies for remote MS monitoring. This paper reviews the different research work and clinical attempts performed over the last decade (both home &amp; hospital-based monitoring) en route to using digital health for MS monitoring and management. Similarly, this systematic review discusses the main challenges and barriers to translating that research from clinics into homes and highlights the opportunities in that context. Throughout this extensive review, we shine a light on various monitoring methods that hold the potential to be measured in a home environment, including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (e.g., motor evoked potential (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and visual evoked potential (VEP)), electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and speech analysis. Combining such digital biomarkers could pave the way for developing a more personalised treatment for MS patients, thereby stopping its progression and avoiding silent MS disability. Adopting digital health for remote monitoring and management could also chart a route ahead for a new era of personalised medicine for MS patients and potentially other brain disorder patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We sequenced nine trios in which the probands in an underserved population were affected by a rare and undiagnosed disorder with neurological features. Sequencing was performed with one trio per flowcell on a benchtop sequencing instrument, leveraging the design of sequencing the proband at twice the coverage of the parents. The reduced coverage in the parents led to sequencing efficiencies while retaining the benefits of trio sequencing: the ability to discover de novo variants and the ability to trace inheritance patterns of rare variants. Once the sequencing data was generated, our two teams used independent informatics pipelines for variant calling and interpretation. In five of the nine cases, both teams found a single SNV or small indel that was deemed causal pending clinical validation. In three of the nine cases, neither team had a significant finding. In the final case, an additional scan for large CNVs performed by one of the teams identified a de novo deletion and duplication in the proband which is the likely cause of the underlying disease. The results across cases with significant findings showed a variety of affected genes (CFAP52, DYNC1H1, FANCE, TCF4, and TOP3A), variant types, and inheritance patterns. All findings were clinically validated, after which the families were counseled about disease management, current research studies (i.e. gene therapy), and family planning. With six of nine families receiving findings, the study demonstrated an efficient and effective trio sequencing design strategy.</p>
