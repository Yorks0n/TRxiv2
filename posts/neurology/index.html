R.\nScore: 42.5, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294253\nVitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination. Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline. However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.\nHow is sleep-disordered breathing linked with biomarkers of Alzheimer disease?\nAuthors: Akradi, M.; Farzane-Daghigh, T.; Ebneabbasi, A.; Bi, H.; Drzezga, A.; Mander, B. A.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294054\nSleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in Alzheimers disease (AD). We assessed whether and how SDB affects neuroimaging biomarkers of AD, including amyloid-beta plaque burden (A{beta}), regional uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose using positron emission tomography (rFDG-PET), grey matter volume (GMV), as well as cognitive scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. MethodsWe selected 757 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database based on cognitive status (AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitively unimpaired (CU)), and SDB condition (with/without SDB). To ensure the reliability of our findings and considering imbalanced sample size across groups, we used a stratified subsampling approach generating 10,000 subsamples (n=10/group). We then selected 512 subsamples with matched covariates. The effect size of the cognitive status-SDB interaction was computed for each biomarker and cognitive score. For reference, we computed 1000 null models by shuffling group labels randomly. The average value of effect sizes for each biomarker in each region was estimated through bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations for both the main and null models and compared with the null models distribution. Linear regression models were next implemented to identify associations between the effect size on A{beta}, rFDG, and GMV with the effect size on cognitive scores and CSF biomarkers across all subsamples. ResultsThe cognitive status-SDB interaction had a medium-sized effect on A{beta}, rFDG and GMV biomarkers in several brain areas. The effect sizes of the mentioned interactions on A{beta} plaque burden in the right precuneus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left occipital fusiform gyrus were associated with the effect sizes of the interactions on cognitive scores. Further, the interaction effect sizes on CSF A{beta}42 were related to the interaction effect sizes on A{beta} in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as rFDG in the left precuneus cortex and GMV in bilateral angular gyrus and right occipital fusiform gyrus. Effect sizes on CSF p-tau were also correlated with the effect sizes on A{beta} in the left lateral occipital cortex and GMV in the left middle temporal gyrus. ConclusionWe observed that SDB interacts with neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of AD. Specifically, SDB has a robust association with markers of A{beta} pathology in PET and CSF relative to rFDG and GMV in the AD group. The cognitive status-SDB interaction on A{beta} is associated with cognitive decline. This study further supports the hypothesis that SDB may precipitate AD pathology.\nClassifying the risk for myasthenic crisis using data-driven explainable machine learning with informative feature design and variance control - a pilot study\nAuthors: Bershan, S.; Meisel, A.; Mergenthaler, P.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.23294175\nKey Points Question: Can machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data? Findings: In this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features. Meaning: These findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision. Abstract Importance: Myasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression. Objective: To test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC. Design: This is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010. Setting: Single center. Participants: A cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023. Exposure: Classification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models. Main Outcomes and Measures: The accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient. Results: This study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models.\nLinking cortical lesions to metabolic changes in multiple sclerosis using 7T proton MR spectroscopy\nAuthors: Madsen, M. A. J.; Povazan, M.; Wiggermann, V.; Lundell, H.; Blinkenberg, M.; Christensen, J. R.; Sellebjerg, F.; Siebner, H. R.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294260\nImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex. DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T. SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020. ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2). ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI. Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel. ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean +/- standard deviation, 45.1 +/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 +/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 +/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 +/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 +/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 +/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups. ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels. Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis? Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume. Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.\nPersonalized chronic adaptive deep brain stimulation outperforms conventional stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Oehrn, C. R.; Cernera, S.; Hammer, L. H.; Shcherbakova, M.; Yao, J.; Hahn, A.; Wang, S.; Ostrem, J. L.; Little, S.; Starr, P. A.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293450\n1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of \"adaptive\" neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.\nNeurostimulation in upper-limb amputees for suppression of phantom limb pain: changes in high-density EEG patterns\nAuthors: Kleeva, D.; Soghoyan, G.; Biktimirov, A.; Piliugin, N.; Matvienko, Y.; Sintsov, M.; Lebedev, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.23294037\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.\nComorbidities in Early-Onset Sporadic versus Presenilin-1 Mutation-Associated Alzheimers Disease Dementia: Evidence for Dependency on Alzheimers Disease Neuropathological Changes\nAuthors: Sepulveda-Falla, D.; Villegas Lanau, C. A.; White, C.; Serrano, G. E.; Acosta Uribe, J.; Mejia Cupajita, B.; Villalba-Moreno, N. D.; Lu, P.; Glatzel, M.; Kofler, J. K.; Ghetti, B.; Frosch, M. P.; Lopera Restrepo, F.; Kosik, K. S.; Beach, T. G.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294081\nAutopsy studies have demonstrated that comorbid neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease occur in the great majority of subjects with Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD), and are likely to additively alter the rate of decline or severity of cognitive impairment. The most important of these are Lewy body disease (LBD), TDP-43 proteinopathy and cerebrovascular disease, including white matter rarefaction (WMR) and cerebral infarcts. Comorbidities may interfere with ADD therapeutic trials evaluation of ADD clinical trials as they may not respond to AD-specific molecular therapeutics. It is possible, however, that at least some comorbidities may be, to some degree, secondary consequences of AD pathology, and if this were true then effective AD-specific therapeutics might also reduce the extent or severity of comorbid pathology. Comorbidities in ADD caused by autosomal dominant mutations such as those in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene may provide an advantageous perspective on their pathogenesis, and deserve attention because these subjects are increasingly being entered into clinical trials. As ADD associated with PSEN1 mutations has a presumed single-cause etiology, and the average age at death is under 60, any comorbidities in this setting may be considered as at least partially secondary to the causative AD mechanisms rather than aging, and thus indicate whether effective ADD therapeutics may also be effective for comorbidities. In this study, we sought to compare the rates and types of ADD comorbidities between subjects with early-onset sporadic ADD (EOSADD; subjects dying under age 60) versus ADD associated with different types of PSEN1 mutations, the most common cause of early-onset autosomal dominant ADD. In particular, we were able to ascertain, for the first time, the prevalences of a fairly complete set of ADD comorbidities in United States (US) PSEN1 cases as well as the Colombian E280A PSEN1 kindred. Data for EOSADD and US PSEN1 subjects (with multiple different mutation types) was obtained from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). Colombian cases all had the E280A mutation and had a set of neuropathological observations classified, like the US cases according to the NACC NP10 definitions. Confirmatory of earlier reports, NACC-defined Alzheimer Disease Neuropathological Changes (ADNC) were consistently very severe in early-onset cases, whether sporadic or in PSEN1 cases, but were slightly less severe in EOSADD. Amyloid angiopathy was the only AD-associated pathology type with widely-differing severity scores between the 3 groups, with median scores of 3, 2 and 1 in the PSEN1 Colombia, PSEN1 US and EOSADD cases, respectively. Apoliprotein E genotype did not show significant proportional group differences for the possession of an E-4 or E-2 allele. Of ADD comorbidities, LBD was most common, being present in more than half of all cases in all 3 groups. For TDP-43 co-pathology, the Colombian PSEN1 group was the most affected, at about 27%, vs 16% and 11% for the US PSEN1 and sporadic US cases, respectively. Notably, hippocampal sclerosis and non-AD tau pathological conditions were not present in any of the US or Colombian PSEN1 cases, and was seen in only 3% of the EOSADD cases. Significant large-vessel atherosclerosis was present in a much larger percentage of Colombian PSEN1 cases, at almost 20% as compared to 0% and 3% of the US PSEN1 and EOSADD cases, respectively. Small-vessel disease, or arteriolosclerosis, was much more common than large vessel disease, being present in all groups between 18% and 37%. Gross and microscopic infarcts, however, as well as gross or microscopic hemorrhages, were generally absent or present at very low percentages in all groups. White matter rarefaction (WMR) was remarkably common, at almost 60%, in the US PSEN1 group, as compared to about 18% in the EOSADD cases, a significant difference. White matter rarefaction was not assessed in the Colombian PSEN1 cases. The results presented here, as well as other evidence, indicates that LBD, TDP-43 pathology and WMR, as common comorbidities with autosomal dominant and early-onset sporadic ADD, should be considered when planning clinical trials with such subjects as they may increase variability in response rates. However, they may be at least partially dependent on ADNC and thus potentially addressable by anti-amyloid or and/anti-tau therapies.\nLong-read sequencing resolves a complex structural variant in PRKN Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Daida, K.; Funayama, M.; Billingsley, K. J.; Malik, L.; Miano-Burkhardt, A.; Leonard, H. L.; Makarious, M. B.; Iwaki, H.; Ding, J.; Gibbs, J. R.; Ishiguro, M.; Yoshino, H.; Ogaki, K.; Oyama, G.; Nishioka, K.; Nonaka, R.; Akamatsu, W.; Blauwendraat, C.; Hattori, N.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23293948\nBackground: PRKN mutations are the most common cause of young onset and autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). PRKN is located in FRA6E which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. Objectives: To identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. Methods: We investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of AMP-PD and UK-Biobank datasets. Results: Multiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon 3 deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4,941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN isoforms. Conclusions: This is the first report describing a large 7Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN. This study highlights the importance of using long-read whole genome sequencing for structural variant analysis in unresolved young-onset PD cases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Vitamin B12 is critical for hematopoiesis and myelination. Deficiency can cause neurologic deficits including loss of coordination, spasticity, and cognitive decline. However, diagnosis relies on vitamin B12 measurement in the blood which may not accurately reflect levels in the brain. Here, we discovered an autoimmune cause of vitamin B12 deficiency restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), termed autoimmune B12 central deficiency (ABCD). Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Patient immunoglobulins impaired cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in vitro. Despite normal serum levels, vitamin B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic vitamin B12 supplementation were associated with increased CSF B12 levels and clinical improvement. Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in 7 other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology and in 6 percent of healthy controls. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. These findings elucidate a new autoimmune cause of metabolic neurologic disease that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in Alzheimers disease (AD). We assessed whether and how SDB affects neuroimaging biomarkers of AD, including amyloid-beta plaque burden (A{beta}), regional uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose using positron emission tomography (rFDG-PET), grey matter volume (GMV), as well as cognitive scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

MethodsWe selected 757 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database based on cognitive status (AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitively unimpaired (CU)), and SDB condition (with/without SDB). To ensure the reliability of our findings and considering imbalanced sample size across groups, we used a stratified subsampling approach generating 10,000 subsamples (n=10/group). We then selected 512 subsamples with matched covariates. The effect size of the cognitive status-SDB interaction was computed for each biomarker and cognitive score. For reference, we computed 1000 null models by shuffling group labels randomly. The average value of effect sizes for each biomarker in each region was estimated through bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations for both the main and null models and compared with the null models distribution. Linear regression models were next implemented to identify associations between the effect size on A{beta}, rFDG, and GMV with the effect size on cognitive scores and CSF biomarkers across all subsamples.

ResultsThe cognitive status-SDB interaction had a medium-sized effect on A{beta}, rFDG and GMV biomarkers in several brain areas. The effect sizes of the mentioned interactions on A{beta} plaque burden in the right precuneus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left occipital fusiform gyrus were associated with the effect sizes of the interactions on cognitive scores. Further, the interaction effect sizes on CSF A{beta}42 were related to the interaction effect sizes on A{beta} in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as rFDG in the left precuneus cortex and GMV in bilateral angular gyrus and right occipital fusiform gyrus. Effect sizes on CSF p-tau were also correlated with the effect sizes on A{beta} in the left lateral occipital cortex and GMV in the left middle temporal gyrus.

ConclusionWe observed that SDB interacts with neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of AD. Specifically, SDB has a robust association with markers of A{beta} pathology in PET and CSF relative to rFDG and GMV in the AD group. The cognitive status-SDB interaction on A{beta} is associated with cognitive decline. This study further supports the hypothesis that SDB may precipitate AD pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Key Points Question: Can machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data? Findings: In this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features. Meaning: These findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision. Abstract Importance: Myasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression. Objective: To test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC. Design: This is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010. Setting: Single center. Participants: A cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023. Exposure: Classification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models. Main Outcomes and Measures: The accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient. Results: This study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCortical lesions contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) but their impact on regional neurotransmitter levels remains to be clarified.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that cortical lesions in MS alter the regional concentrations of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the affected cortex.

DesignProspective, cross-sectional, observational proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and structural MRI study at 7T.

SettingData were collected at a single center between August 2018 and September 2020.

ParticipantsA volunteer sample of 57 MS patients and 38 healthy participants were screened for participation in the study. 50 MS patients and 28 healthy participants were included. In the final cohort, three patients and five healthy participants were excluded due to drop out (n=6) or insufficient data-quality (n=2).

ExposuresTwo-voxel 7T 1H-MRS covering the right and left sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) and high-resolution structural brain 7T MRI.

Main outcomeRegional concentrations of glutamate and GABA in SM1-HAND and their relation to cortical lesion volume within the MRS voxel.

ResultsData from 34 relapsing remitting (RR) and 13 secondary progressive (SP)MS patients (mean &#43;/- standard deviation, 45.1 &#43;/- 12.5 years, 31 female) along with 23 age- and sex-matched healthy participants (44.4 &#43;/- 13 years, 15 female) entered data-analyses. Patient data were pooled to assess the relationship between cortical lesion volume and neurotransmitter levels. Larger cortical lesion volume within SM1-HAND was associated with higher regional glutamate (0.61 &#43;/- 0.21 log(mm3), P=0.005) and lower regional GABA (-0.71 &#43;/- 0.27 log(mm3), P=0.01) concentration. Between-group comparison showed that glutamate concentration within the SM1-voxel was reduced in SPMS patients compared to healthy participants (-0.75 &#43;/- 0.24 mM, P=0.004) and RRMS patients (-0.55 &#43;/- 0.22 mM, P=0.04), while regional GABA levels did not differ among groups.

ConclusionOur results link cortical lesion load in SM1-HAND with regional glutamate and GABA levels in patients with RRMS and SPMS, showing a shift in balance between regional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters towards increased excitation with increasing cortical lesion volume. Between-group comparisons provide preliminary evidence that a progressive disease course may be associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate levels.

Key pointsQuestion: How do cortical lesions change the regional metabolic profile in multiple sclerosis?

Findings: This observational cross-sectional study employed voxel-based proton MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the primary sensorimotor hand areas (SM1-HAND) at ultra-high field (7T) to show that cortical lesions alter regional concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We found that higher regional glutamate concentrations were associated with larger regional cortical lesion volume, whereas higher GABA concentrations were associated with lower regional cortical lesion volume.

Meaning: These findings suggest that cortical lesions shift the regional excitation-inhibition balance towards excitation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of &#34;adaptive&#34; neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a distressing and persistent sensation that occurs after the amputation of a limb. While medication-based treatments have limitations and adverse effects, neurostimulation is a promising alternative approach whose mechanism of action needs research, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for the assessment of cortical manifestation of PLP relieving effects. Here we collected and analyzed high-density EEG data in three patients (P01, P02, and P03). Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) suppressed PLP in P01, but was ineffective in P02. By contrast, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was effective in P02. In P03, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was used to suppress PLP. Changes in EEG oscillatory components we analyzed using spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) and Petrosian fractal dimension (FD). With these methods, changes EEG spatio-spectral components were found in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in all patients, with these effects being specific to each individual. These changes in EEG patterns were found for both the periods when PLP level was stationary and the periods when PLP was gradually changing after neurostimulation was turned on or off. One consistent effect was an increase in EEG fractal dimension on the side contralateral to the amputation when PLP was present, while effective stimulation resulted in a decrease in fractal dimension. Overall, our findings align with the proposed roles of brain rhythms in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is has been linked to neuropathic pain. The individual differences in the observed effects could be related to the specifics of treatment in each patient and the unique spectral characteristics in each of them. These findings pave way to the closed-loop systems for PLP management where neurostimulation parameters are adjusted based on EEG-derived markers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autopsy studies have demonstrated that comorbid neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease occur in the great majority of subjects with Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD), and are likely to additively alter the rate of decline or severity of cognitive impairment. The most important of these are Lewy body disease (LBD), TDP-43 proteinopathy and cerebrovascular disease, including white matter rarefaction (WMR) and cerebral infarcts. Comorbidities may interfere with ADD therapeutic trials evaluation of ADD clinical trials as they may not respond to AD-specific molecular therapeutics. It is possible, however, that at least some comorbidities may be, to some degree, secondary consequences of AD pathology, and if this were true then effective AD-specific therapeutics might also reduce the extent or severity of comorbid pathology. Comorbidities in ADD caused by autosomal dominant mutations such as those in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene may provide an advantageous perspective on their pathogenesis, and deserve attention because these subjects are increasingly being entered into clinical trials. As ADD associated with PSEN1 mutations has a presumed single-cause etiology, and the average age at death is under 60, any comorbidities in this setting may be considered as at least partially secondary to the causative AD mechanisms rather than aging, and thus indicate whether effective ADD therapeutics may also be effective for comorbidities. In this study, we sought to compare the rates and types of ADD comorbidities between subjects with early-onset sporadic ADD (EOSADD; subjects dying under age 60) versus ADD associated with different types of PSEN1 mutations, the most common cause of early-onset autosomal dominant ADD. In particular, we were able to ascertain, for the first time, the prevalences of a fairly complete set of ADD comorbidities in United States (US) PSEN1 cases as well as the Colombian E280A PSEN1 kindred. Data for EOSADD and US PSEN1 subjects (with multiple different mutation types) was obtained from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). Colombian cases all had the E280A mutation and had a set of neuropathological observations classified, like the US cases according to the NACC NP10 definitions. Confirmatory of earlier reports, NACC-defined Alzheimer Disease Neuropathological Changes (ADNC) were consistently very severe in early-onset cases, whether sporadic or in PSEN1 cases, but were slightly less severe in EOSADD. Amyloid angiopathy was the only AD-associated pathology type with widely-differing severity scores between the 3 groups, with median scores of 3, 2 and 1 in the PSEN1 Colombia, PSEN1 US and EOSADD cases, respectively. Apoliprotein E genotype did not show significant proportional group differences for the possession of an E-4 or E-2 allele. Of ADD comorbidities, LBD was most common, being present in more than half of all cases in all 3 groups. For TDP-43 co-pathology, the Colombian PSEN1 group was the most affected, at about 27%, vs 16% and 11% for the US PSEN1 and sporadic US cases, respectively. Notably, hippocampal sclerosis and non-AD tau pathological conditions were not present in any of the US or Colombian PSEN1 cases, and was seen in only 3% of the EOSADD cases. Significant large-vessel atherosclerosis was present in a much larger percentage of Colombian PSEN1 cases, at almost 20% as compared to 0% and 3% of the US PSEN1 and EOSADD cases, respectively. Small-vessel disease, or arteriolosclerosis, was much more common than large vessel disease, being present in all groups between 18% and 37%. Gross and microscopic infarcts, however, as well as gross or microscopic hemorrhages, were generally absent or present at very low percentages in all groups. White matter rarefaction (WMR) was remarkably common, at almost 60%, in the US PSEN1 group, as compared to about 18% in the EOSADD cases, a significant difference. White matter rarefaction was not assessed in the Colombian PSEN1 cases. The results presented here, as well as other evidence, indicates that LBD, TDP-43 pathology and WMR, as common comorbidities with autosomal dominant and early-onset sporadic ADD, should be considered when planning clinical trials with such subjects as they may increase variability in response rates. However, they may be at least partially dependent on ADNC and thus potentially addressable by anti-amyloid or and/anti-tau therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: PRKN mutations are the most common cause of young onset and autosomal recessive Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD). PRKN is located in FRA6E which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. Objectives: To identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. Methods: We investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of AMP-PD and UK-Biobank datasets. Results: Multiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon 3 deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4,941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN isoforms. Conclusions: This is the first report describing a large 7Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN. This study highlights the importance of using long-read whole genome sequencing for structural variant analysis in unresolved young-onset PD cases.</p>
