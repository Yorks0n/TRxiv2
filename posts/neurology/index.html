A.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296861\nClinical variants of Alzheimers disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) display a spectrum of cognitive-behavioural changes varying between individuals and over time. Understanding the landscape of these graded individual-/group-level longitudinal variations is critical for precise phenotyping; however, this remains challenging to model. Addressing this challenge, we leverage the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center database to derive a unified geometric framework of graded AD/FTLD longitudinal phenotypic variation. Using three time-point, cognitive-behavioural and clinical data from 390 typical, atypical and intermediate AD/FTLD variants, we apply advanced data-science approaches to derive low-dimensional geometric spaces capturing core features underpinning AD/FTLD clinical progression. Importantly, these geometries enable the assimilation and inter-relation of paradigmatic and mixed cases, capturing dynamic individual trajectories, and linking syndromic variability to neuropathology and key clinical end-points such as survival. This resultant mapping of dynamics underlying cognitive-behavioural evolution potentially holds paradigm-changing implications to predicting phenotypic diversification and phenotype-neurobiological mapping in AD/FTLD.\nA CCG expansion in ABCD3 causes oculopharyngodistal myopathy in individuals of European ancestry\nAuthors: Cortese, A.; Beecroft, S.

M.; Amor, D.; Nicholson, G.; Vucic, S.; Henderson, R.; Robertson, T.; Dyke, J.; Fabian, V.; Mastaglia, F.; Davis, M. R.; Kennerson, M.; OPDM study group, ; Genomics England, ; Qui\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296582\nIndividuals affected by inherited neuromuscular diseases often present with a specific pattern of muscle weakness, which can guide clinicians in genetic investigations and variant interpretation. Nonetheless, more than 50% of cases do not receive a genetic diagnosis. Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an inherited myopathy manifesting with a particular combination of ptosis, dysphagia and distal weakness. Pathologically it is characterised by rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions on muscle biopsy. In recent years GCC * CCG repeat expansion in four different genes have been identified in individuals affected by OPDM in Asian populations. None of these have been identified in affected individuals of non-Asian ancestry. In this study we describe the identification of CCG expansions in ABCD3 in affected individuals across eight unrelated OPDM families of European ancestry. In two large Australian OPDM families, using a combination of linkage studies, short-read WGS and targeted ONT sequencing, we identified CCG expansions in the 5UTR of ABCD3. Independently, the ABCD3 CCG expansion was identified through the 100,000 Genomics England Genome Project in three individuals from two unrelated UK families diagnosed with OPDM. Targeted ONT sequencing confirmed the presence of mono-allelic CCG repeat expansions ranging from 118 to 694 repeats in all tested cases (n=19). The expansions were on average 1.9 times longer in affected females than affected males, and children of affected males were [~]2.3 times more likely to have the disease than those of affected females, suggesting inheritance of an expanded allele from an affected mother may have reduced penetrance. ABCD3 transcripts appeared upregulated in skeletal muscle and cells derived from affected OPDM individuals, suggesting a potential role of over-expression of CCG repeat containing ABCD3 transcript in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. The study provides further evidence of the role of non-coding repeat expansions in unsolved neuromuscular diseases and strengthens the association between the GCC * CCG repeat motif and a specific pattern of muscle weakness with prominent cranial involvement across different populations.\nSingle-nucleus transcriptomics reveals disease- and pathology-specific signatures in α-synucleinopathies\nAuthors: Nido, G. S.; Castelli, M.; Mostafavi, S.; Shadad, O.; Alves, G.; Tysnes, O.-B.; Dölle, C.; Tzoulis, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296642\n-synucleinopathies are severe neurodegenerative disorders characterized by intracellular aggregation of -synuclein, yet their molecular pathogenesis remains unknow. Here, we explore cell-specific changes in gene expression across different -synucleinopathies. We perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the prefrontal cortex of individuals with idiopathic Parkinsons disease (iPD), Parkinsons disease caused by LRRK2 mutations (LRRK2-PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and healthy controls. iPD and LRRK2-PD exhibit a largely overlapping cell type-specific signature, which is distinct from that of MSA, and includes an overall decrease of the transcriptional output in neurons. Notably, most of the differential expression signal in iPD and LRRK2-PD is concentrated in a specific deep cortical neuronal subtype expressing adrenoceptor alpha 2A. While most differentially expressed genes are highly cell type- and disease-specific, PDE10A is found consistently downregulated in most cortical neurons, and across all three diseases. Finally, exploiting the variable presence and/or severity of -synuclein pathology in LRRK2-PD and iPD, we identify cell type-specific signatures associated with -synuclein pathology, including a neuronal upregulation of the SNCA gene itself, encoding -synuclein. Our findings provide novel insights into the cell-specific transcriptional landscape of the -synucleinopathy spectrum.\nSalience network and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Yeager, B. E.; Twedt, H. P.; Bruss, J.; Schultz, J.; Narayanan, N. S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296825\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with cognitive as well as motor impairments. While much is known about the brain networks leading to motor impairments in PD, less is known about the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments. Here, we leveraged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine network dysfunction in PD patients with cognitive impairment. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive impairments in PD involve altered connectivity of the salience network (SN), a key cortical network that detects and integrates responses to salient stimuli. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a continuous index of coarse cognitive function in PD. We report two major results. First, in 82 PD patients we found significant relationships between lower intra-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network (FPN; comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices bilaterally) with lower MoCA scores. Second, we found significant relationships between lower inter-network connectivity between the SN and the basal ganglia network (BGN) and the default mode network (DMN) with lower MoCA scores. These data support our hypothesis about the SN and provide new insights into the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments in PD.\nStriatal dopamine tone is positively associated with body mass index in humans as determined by PET using dual dopamine type-2 receptor antagonist tracers\nAuthors: Darcey, V. L.; Guo, J.; Chi, M.; Chung, S. T.; Courville, A. B.; Gallagher, I.; Herscovitch, P.; Howard, R.; La Noire, M.; Milley, L.; Schick, A.; Stagliano, M.; Turner, S.; Urbanski, N.; Yang, S.; Yim, E.; Zhai, N.; Zhou, M. S.; Hall, K. D.\nScore: 47.5, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296169\nThe relationship between adiposity and dopamine type-2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the human brain has been repeatedly studied for \u003e20 years with highly discrepant results, likely due to variable methodologies and differing study populations. We conducted a controlled inpatient feeding study to measure D2BP in the striatum using positron emission tomography with both [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in pseudo-random order in 54 young adults with a wide range of body mass index (BMI 20-44 kg/m2). Within-subject D2BP measurements using the two tracers were moderately correlated (r=0.47, p\u003c0.001). D2BP was negatively correlated with BMI as measured by [11C]raclopride (r= -0.51; p\u003c0.0001) but not [18F]fallypride (r=-0.01; p=0.92) and these correlation coefficients were significantly different from each other (p\u003c0.001). Given that [18F]fallypride has greater binding affinity to dopamine type-2 receptors than [11C]raclopride, which is more easily displaced by endogenous dopamine, our results suggest that adiposity is positively associated with increased striatal dopamine tone.\nSingle-value fMRI scores reflect both stage and risk across the Alzheimer's disease continuum\nAuthors: Soch, J.; Richter, A.; Kizilirmak, J.

J.; Teipel, S.; Wiltfang, J.; Jessen, F.; Wagner, M.; Düzel, E.; Schott, B. H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296891\nSingle-value scores reflecting the deviation from (FADE score) or similarity with (SAME score) prototypical novelty-related and memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns in young adults have been proposed as imaging biomarkers of healthy neurocognitive aging. Here, we tested the utility of these scores as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD). To this end, we analyzed subsequent memory fMRI data from individuals with SCD, MCI, and AD dementia as well as healthy controls (HC) and first-degree relatives of AD dementia patients (AD-rel) who participated in the multi-center DELCODE study (N = 468). Based on the individual participants' whole-brain fMRI novelty and subsequent memory responses, we calculated the FADE and SAME scores and assessed their association with AD risk stage, neuropsychological test scores, CSF amyloid positivity, and ApoE genotype. Memory-based FADE and SAME scores showed a considerably larger deviation from a reference sample of young adults in the MCI and AD dementia groups compared to HC, SCD and AD-rel. In addition, novelty-based scores significantly differed between the MCI and AD dementia groups. Across the entire sample, single-value scores correlated with neuropsychological test performance. The novelty-based SAME score further differed between A{beta}-positive and A{beta}-negative individuals in SCD and AD-rel, and between ApoE {epsilon}4 carriers and non-carriers in AD-rel. Hence, FADE and SAME scores are associated with both cognitive performance and individual risk factors for AD. Their potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers warrants further exploration, particularly in individuals with SCD and healthy relatives of AD dementia patients.\nDigital gait measures capture 1-year progression in early-stage spinocerebellar ataxia type 2\nAuthors: Seemann, J.; Daghsen, L.; Cazier, M.; Lamy, J.-C.; Welter, M.-L.; Giese, M. A.; Synofzik, M.; DURR, A.; Ilg, W.; Coarelli, G.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296692\nBACKGROUNDWith disease-modifying drugs in reach for cerebellar ataxias, fine-grained digital health measures are highly warranted to complement clinical and patient-reported outcome measures in upcoming treatment trials and treatment monitoring. These measures need to demonstrate sensitivity to capture change, in particular in the early stages of the disease. OBJECTIVETo unravel gait measures sensitive to longitudinal change in the - particularly trial-relevant- early stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). METHODSMulti-center longitudinal study with combined cross-sectional and 1-year interval longitudinal analysis in early-stage SCA2 participants (n=23, including 9 pre-ataxic expansion carriers; median ATXN2 CAG repeat expansion 38{+/-}2; median SARA [Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia] score 4.83{+/-}4.31). Gait was assessed using three wearable motion sensors during a 2-minute walk, with analyses focusing on gait measures of spatiotemporal variability shown sensitive to ataxia severity, e.g. lateral step deviation. RESULTSWe found significant changes for gait measures between baseline and 1-year follow-up with large effect sizes (lateral step deviation p=0.0001, effect size rprb=0.78), whereas the SARA score showed no change (p=0.67). Sample size estimation indicates a required cohort size of n=43 to detect a 50% reduction in natural progression. Test-retest reliability and Minimal Detectable Change analysis confirm the accuracy of detecting 50% of the identified 1-year change. CONCLUSIONSGait measures assessed by wearable sensors can capture natural progression in early-stage SCA2 within just one year - in contrast to a clinical ataxia outcome. Lateral step deviation thus represents a promising outcome measure for upcoming multi-centre interventional trials, particularly in the early stages of cerebellar ataxia.\nMachine learning based on event-related oscillations of working memory differentiates between preclinical Alzheimer's disease and neurotypical aging\nAuthors: Liao, K.; Martin, L. E.; Fakorede, S.; Brooks, W. M.; Burns, J. M.; Devos, H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296890\nThere is increasing evidence of the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) as an early neurophysiological marker of preclinical AD. Our objective was to apply machine learning approaches on event-related oscillations to discriminate preclinical AD from neurotypical controls. Twenty-two preclinical AD participants who were cognitively normal with elevated amyloid and 21 cognitively normal with no elevated amyloid controls completed n-back working memory tasks (n= 0, 1, 2). EEG signals were recorded through a high-density sensor net. The event-related spectral changes were extracted using the discrete wavelet transform in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. The support vector machine (SVM) machine learning method was employed to classify participants, and classification performance was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The relative power of the beta and delta bands outperformed other frequency bands with higher AUC values. The 2-back task obtained higher AUC values than the 0 and 1-back tasks. The highest AUC values were from the 2-back task beta band (AUC = 0.86) and delta bands (AUC = 0.85) nontarget data. This study demonstrates the promise of using machine learning on EEG event-related oscillations from working memory tasks to detect preclinical AD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Clinical variants of Alzheimers disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) display a spectrum of cognitive-behavioural changes varying between individuals and over time. Understanding the landscape of these graded individual-/group-level longitudinal variations is critical for precise phenotyping; however, this remains challenging to model. Addressing this challenge, we leverage the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center database to derive a unified geometric framework of graded AD/FTLD longitudinal phenotypic variation. Using three time-point, cognitive-behavioural and clinical data from 390 typical, atypical and intermediate AD/FTLD variants, we apply advanced data-science approaches to derive low-dimensional geometric spaces capturing core features underpinning AD/FTLD clinical progression. Importantly, these geometries enable the assimilation and inter-relation of paradigmatic and mixed cases, capturing dynamic individual trajectories, and linking syndromic variability to neuropathology and key clinical end-points such as survival. This resultant mapping of dynamics underlying cognitive-behavioural evolution potentially holds paradigm-changing implications to predicting phenotypic diversification and phenotype-neurobiological mapping in AD/FTLD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals affected by inherited neuromuscular diseases often present with a specific pattern of muscle weakness, which can guide clinicians in genetic investigations and variant interpretation. Nonetheless, more than 50% of cases do not receive a genetic diagnosis. Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an inherited myopathy manifesting with a particular combination of ptosis, dysphagia and distal weakness. Pathologically it is characterised by rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions on muscle biopsy. In recent years GCC * CCG repeat expansion in four different genes have been identified in individuals affected by OPDM in Asian populations. None of these have been identified in affected individuals of non-Asian ancestry.

In this study we describe the identification of CCG expansions in ABCD3 in affected individuals across eight unrelated OPDM families of European ancestry. In two large Australian OPDM families, using a combination of linkage studies, short-read WGS and targeted ONT sequencing, we identified CCG expansions in the 5UTR of ABCD3. Independently, the ABCD3 CCG expansion was identified through the 100,000 Genomics England Genome Project in three individuals from two unrelated UK families diagnosed with OPDM. Targeted ONT sequencing confirmed the presence of mono-allelic CCG repeat expansions ranging from 118 to 694 repeats in all tested cases (n=19). The expansions were on average 1.9 times longer in affected females than affected males, and children of affected males were [~]2.3 times more likely to have the disease than those of affected females, suggesting inheritance of an expanded allele from an affected mother may have reduced penetrance. ABCD3 transcripts appeared upregulated in skeletal muscle and cells derived from affected OPDM individuals, suggesting a potential role of over-expression of CCG repeat containing ABCD3 transcript in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. The study provides further evidence of the role of non-coding repeat expansions in unsolved neuromuscular diseases and strengthens the association between the GCC * CCG repeat motif and a specific pattern of muscle weakness with prominent cranial involvement across different populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">-synucleinopathies are severe neurodegenerative disorders characterized by intracellular aggregation of -synuclein, yet their molecular pathogenesis remains unknow. Here, we explore cell-specific changes in gene expression across different -synucleinopathies. We perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the prefrontal cortex of individuals with idiopathic Parkinsons disease (iPD), Parkinsons disease caused by LRRK2 mutations (LRRK2-PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and healthy controls. iPD and LRRK2-PD exhibit a largely overlapping cell type-specific signature, which is distinct from that of MSA, and includes an overall decrease of the transcriptional output in neurons. Notably, most of the differential expression signal in iPD and LRRK2-PD is concentrated in a specific deep cortical neuronal subtype expressing adrenoceptor alpha 2A. While most differentially expressed genes are highly cell type- and disease-specific, PDE10A is found consistently downregulated in most cortical neurons, and across all three diseases. Finally, exploiting the variable presence and/or severity of -synuclein pathology in LRRK2-PD and iPD, we identify cell type-specific signatures associated with -synuclein pathology, including a neuronal upregulation of the SNCA gene itself, encoding -synuclein. Our findings provide novel insights into the cell-specific transcriptional landscape of the -synucleinopathy spectrum.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with cognitive as well as motor impairments. While much is known about the brain networks leading to motor impairments in PD, less is known about the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments. Here, we leveraged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Parkinson&#39;s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine network dysfunction in PD patients with cognitive impairment. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive impairments in PD involve altered connectivity of the salience network (SN), a key cortical network that detects and integrates responses to salient stimuli. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a continuous index of coarse cognitive function in PD. We report two major results. First, in 82 PD patients we found significant relationships between lower intra-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network (FPN; comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices bilaterally) with lower MoCA scores. Second, we found significant relationships between lower inter-network connectivity between the SN and the basal ganglia network (BGN) and the default mode network (DMN) with lower MoCA scores. These data support our hypothesis about the SN and provide new insights into the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments in PD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relationship between adiposity and dopamine type-2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the human brain has been repeatedly studied for &gt;20 years with highly discrepant results, likely due to variable methodologies and differing study populations. We conducted a controlled inpatient feeding study to measure D2BP in the striatum using positron emission tomography with both [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in pseudo-random order in 54 young adults with a wide range of body mass index (BMI 20-44 kg/m2). Within-subject D2BP measurements using the two tracers were moderately correlated (r=0.47, p&lt;0.001). D2BP was negatively correlated with BMI as measured by [11C]raclopride (r= -0.51; p&lt;0.0001) but not [18F]fallypride (r=-0.01; p=0.92) and these correlation coefficients were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.001). Given that [18F]fallypride has greater binding affinity to dopamine type-2 receptors than [11C]raclopride, which is more easily displaced by endogenous dopamine, our results suggest that adiposity is positively associated with increased striatal dopamine tone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-value scores reflecting the deviation from (FADE score) or similarity with (SAME score) prototypical novelty-related and memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns in young adults have been proposed as imaging biomarkers of healthy neurocognitive aging. Here, we tested the utility of these scores as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD). To this end, we analyzed subsequent memory fMRI data from individuals with SCD, MCI, and AD dementia as well as healthy controls (HC) and first-degree relatives of AD dementia patients (AD-rel) who participated in the multi-center DELCODE study (N = 468). Based on the individual participants&#39; whole-brain fMRI novelty and subsequent memory responses, we calculated the FADE and SAME scores and assessed their association with AD risk stage, neuropsychological test scores, CSF amyloid positivity, and ApoE genotype. Memory-based FADE and SAME scores showed a considerably larger deviation from a reference sample of young adults in the MCI and AD dementia groups compared to HC, SCD and AD-rel. In addition, novelty-based scores significantly differed between the MCI and AD dementia groups. Across the entire sample, single-value scores correlated with neuropsychological test performance. The novelty-based SAME score further differed between A{beta}-positive and A{beta}-negative individuals in SCD and AD-rel, and between ApoE {epsilon}4 carriers and non-carriers in AD-rel. Hence, FADE and SAME scores are associated with both cognitive performance and individual risk factors for AD. Their potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers warrants further exploration, particularly in individuals with SCD and healthy relatives of AD dementia patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDWith disease-modifying drugs in reach for cerebellar ataxias, fine-grained digital health measures are highly warranted to complement clinical and patient-reported outcome measures in upcoming treatment trials and treatment monitoring. These measures need to demonstrate sensitivity to capture change, in particular in the early stages of the disease.

OBJECTIVETo unravel gait measures sensitive to longitudinal change in the - particularly trial-relevant- early stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).

METHODSMulti-center longitudinal study with combined cross-sectional and 1-year interval longitudinal analysis in early-stage SCA2 participants (n=23, including 9 pre-ataxic expansion carriers; median ATXN2 CAG repeat expansion 38{&#43;/-}2; median SARA [Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia] score 4.83{&#43;/-}4.31). Gait was assessed using three wearable motion sensors during a 2-minute walk, with analyses focusing on gait measures of spatiotemporal variability shown sensitive to ataxia severity, e.g. lateral step deviation.

RESULTSWe found significant changes for gait measures between baseline and 1-year follow-up with large effect sizes (lateral step deviation p=0.0001, effect size rprb=0.78), whereas the SARA score showed no change (p=0.67). Sample size estimation indicates a required cohort size of n=43 to detect a 50% reduction in natural progression. Test-retest reliability and Minimal Detectable Change analysis confirm the accuracy of detecting 50% of the identified 1-year change.

CONCLUSIONSGait measures assessed by wearable sensors can capture natural progression in early-stage SCA2 within just one year - in contrast to a clinical ataxia outcome. Lateral step deviation thus represents a promising outcome measure for upcoming multi-centre interventional trials, particularly in the early stages of cerebellar ataxia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is increasing evidence of the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) as an early neurophysiological marker of preclinical AD. Our objective was to apply machine learning approaches on event-related oscillations to discriminate preclinical AD from neurotypical controls. Twenty-two preclinical AD participants who were cognitively normal with elevated amyloid and 21 cognitively normal with no elevated amyloid controls completed n-back working memory tasks (n= 0, 1, 2). EEG signals were recorded through a high-density sensor net. The event-related spectral changes were extracted using the discrete wavelet transform in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. The support vector machine (SVM) machine learning method was employed to classify participants, and classification performance was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The relative power of the beta and delta bands outperformed other frequency bands with higher AUC values. The 2-back task obtained higher AUC values than the 0 and 1-back tasks. The highest AUC values were from the 2-back task beta band (AUC = 0.86) and delta bands (AUC = 0.85) nontarget data.
