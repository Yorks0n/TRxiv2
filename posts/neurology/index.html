For the purposes of screening, recruitment, stratification, and longitudinal follow-up in clinical trials, there are no established online digital platforms validated against plasma biomarkers of AD. Here we report findings using a novel web-based platform that assessed different cognitive functions in AD patients (N=46) and elderly controls (N=53) who were also assessed for plasma biomarkers of AD (amyloid {beta}42/40 ratio, pTau181, GFAP, NfL). Their performance was compared to a second, larger group of elderly controls (N=256). AD patients were significantly impaired across all digital cognitive tests, with performance correlating with plasma biomarker levels, particularly pTau181. These findings show how online testing can now be deployed in AD patients to measure cognitive function effectively and related to blood biomarkers of the disease.\nNigral volume loss in prodromal, early, and moderate Parkinson' disease\nAuthors: langley, j.; Hwang, K.; Huddleston, D.; Hu, X.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.23294281\nThe loss of melanized neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is a hallmark pathology in Parkinsons disease (PD). Melanized neurons in SNc can be visualized in vivo using magnetization transfer (MT) effects. Nigral volume was extracted in data acquired with a MT-prepared gradient echo sequence in 33 controls, 83 non-manifest carriers (42 LRRK2 and 41 GBA nonmanifest carriers), 65 prodromal hyposmic participants, 105 de novo PD patients and 26 48-month PD patients from the Parkinsons Progressive Markers Initiative. No difference in nigral volume was seen between controls and LRRK2 and GBA non-manifest carriers (F=0.076; P=0.927). A significant main effect in group was observed between controls, prodromal hyposmic participants, and overt PD patients (F=5.192; P=0.002). Longer disease duration significantly correlated with lower nigral volume (r=-0.252; P=0.010). This study shows that nigral depigmentation can be robustly detected in prodromal hyposmic participants and overt PD patients.\nAssessing Clinical Progression Measures in Alzheimer's Disease Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: McLaughlin, J.; Scotton, W.; Hardy, J.; Shoai, M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294771\nClinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression. In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}+) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs. SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disease. It is now widely recognised that there is a pre-clinical phase. This phase of the disease may be apparent via biomarker testing up to 20 years before clinically evident AD. Pre-clinical AD is then followed by clinically significant cognitive decline ranging from MCI to severe AD. The aim of randomised controlled trials (RCT) is to reduce or halt the rate of clinical progression of AD. Most of these trials have been unsuccessful. To determine the effectiveness of treatments there must be robust and reliable tools for measuring AD progression. For at least 30 years there has been recognition that the measures of progression used in AD clinical trials are problematic. A significant concern is that current measures of clinical progression are potentially not sensitive enough in early and preclinical stages of AD and so are not reliable indicators of AD progression. In this systematic review and meta-regression we aimed to assess the precision of measurements of clinical progression in AD clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry. MethodsMeta analyses of RCTs in AD with amyloid positive status (A{beta}+) as an inclusion criterion was undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0 and the metafor and emmeans libraries. FindingsOf the progression measures commonly reported in RCTs, the FAQ, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE. Other cognitive measures were amongst the least sensitive measures over the chosen time period. As a composite score, both the iADRS and CDRSB appear to be performing better than the cognitive components they comprise. The neuropsychiatric battery analysed in this study appeared to be the least sensitive of measures of progression. InterpretationFunctional measures, with the exception of QoL-AD, perform better than other groups of measures. Measures which rely on purely cognitive domains are not optimal for sole use in AD trials. Ideally, measures should include both cognitive and functional components to enhance sensitivity. New composite measures address the poorer performance of composite scores, as compared to their comprising functional measures, by assigning different weights to cognitive and functional change.\nMicrosoft Bing vs Google Bard in Neurology: A Comparative Study of AI-Generated Patient Education Material\nAuthors: Nazir, T.; Mal, M.; Rehman, M. M.; Ahmad, U.; Saeed, R.; Kalia, J. S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294641\nBackgroundPatient education is an essential component of healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as Google Bard and Microsoft Bing have the potential to improve information transmission and enhance patient care. However, it is crucial to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and understandability of the materials generated by these models before applying them in medical practice. This study aimed to assess and compare the quality of patient education materials produced by Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in response to questions related to neurological conditions. MethodsA cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate and compare the ability of Google Bard and Microsoft Bing to generate patient education materials. The study included the top ten prevalent neurological diseases based on WHO prevalence data. Ten board-certified neurologists and four neurology residents evaluated the responses generated by the models on six quality metrics. The scores for each model were compiled and averaged across all measures, and the significance of any observed variations was assessed using an independent t-test. ResultsGoogle Bard performed better than Microsoft Bing in all six-quality metrics, with an overall mean score of 79% and 69%, respectively. Google Bard outperformed Microsoft Bing in all measures for eight questions, while Microsoft Bing performed marginally better in terms of objectivity and clarity for the epilepsy query. ConclusionThis study showed that Google Bard performs better than Microsoft Bing in generating patient education materials for neurological diseases. However, healthcare professionals should take into account both AI models advantages and disadvantages when providing support for health information requirements. Future studies can help determine the underlying causes of these variations and guide cooperative initiatives to create more user-focused AI-generated patient education materials. Finally, researchers should consider the perception of patients regarding AI-generated patient education material and its impact on implementing these solutions in healthcare settings.\nIpsiHand Brain-Computer Interface Therapy Induces Broad Upper Extremity Motor Recovery in Chronic Stroke\nAuthors: Rustamov, N.; Souders, L.; Sheehan, L.; Carter, A.; Leuthardt, E. C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294320\nBackground and PurposeChronic hemiparetic stroke patients have very limited benefits from current therapies. Brain-computer interface (BCI) engaging the unaffected hemisphere has emerged as a promising novel therapeutic approach for chronic stroke rehabilitation. This study investigated the effectiveness of the IpsiHand System, a contralesionally-controlled BCI therapy in chronic stroke patients with impaired upper extremity motor function. We further explored neurophysiological features of motor recovery affected by BCI. We hypothesized that BCI therapy would induce a broad motor recovery in the upper extremity (proximal and distal), and there would be corresponding changes in baseline theta and gamma oscillations, which have been shown to be associated with motor recovery. MethodsThirty chronic hemiparetic stroke patients performed a therapeutic BCI task for 12 weeks. Motor function assessment data and resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were acquired before initiating BCI therapy and across BCI therapy sessions. The Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer assessment (UEFM) served as a primary motor outcome assessment tool. Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was computed and correlated with motor recovery. ResultsChronic stroke patients achieved significant motor improvement with BCI therapy. We found significant improvement in both proximal and distal upper extremity motor function. Importantly, motor function improvement was independent of Botox application. Theta-gamma CFC enhanced bilaterally over the C3 and C4 motor electrodes following BCI therapy. We observed significant positive correlations between motor recovery and theta gamma CFC increase across BCI therapy sessions. ConclusionsBCI therapy resulted in significant motor function improvement across the proximal and distal upper extremities of patients. This therapy was significantly correlated with changes in baseline cortical dynamics, specifically theta-gamma CFC increases in both the right and left motor regions. This may represent rhythm-specific cortical oscillatory mechanism for BCI-driven motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients.\nSynaptic inhibitory dynamics drive benzodiazepine response in paediatric status epilepticus\nAuthors: Fedele, T.; Burman, R. J.; Steinberg, A.; Selmin, G.; Ramantani, G.; Rosch, R.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294456\nPaediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.\nPersonalized chronic adaptive deep brain stimulation outperforms conventional stimulation in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Oehrn, C. R.; Cernera, S.; Hammer, L. H.; Shcherbakova, M.; Yao, J.; Hahn, A.; Wang, S.; Ostrem, J. L.; Little, S.; Starr, P. A.\nScore: 23.7, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293450\n1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of \"adaptive\" neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.\nClassifying the risk for myasthenic crisis using data-driven explainable machine learning with informative feature design and variance control - a pilot study\nAuthors: Bershan, S.; Meisel, A.; Mergenthaler, P.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.23294175\nImportanceMyasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression. ObjectiveTo test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC. DesignThis is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010. SettingSingle center. ParticipantsA cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023. ExposureClassification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient. ResultsThis study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data? FindingsIn this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features. MeaningThese findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A major limitation in current Alzheimers disease (AD) research is the lack of the ability to measure cognitive performance at scale--robustly, remotely, and frequently. For the purposes of screening, recruitment, stratification, and longitudinal follow-up in clinical trials, there are no established online digital platforms validated against plasma biomarkers of AD. Here we report findings using a novel web-based platform that assessed different cognitive functions in AD patients (N=46) and elderly controls (N=53) who were also assessed for plasma biomarkers of AD (amyloid {beta}42/40 ratio, pTau181, GFAP, NfL). Their performance was compared to a second, larger group of elderly controls (N=256). AD patients were significantly impaired across all digital cognitive tests, with performance correlating with plasma biomarker levels, particularly pTau181. These findings show how online testing can now be deployed in AD patients to measure cognitive function effectively and related to blood biomarkers of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The loss of melanized neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is a hallmark pathology in Parkinsons disease (PD). Melanized neurons in SNc can be visualized in vivo using magnetization transfer (MT) effects. Nigral volume was extracted in data acquired with a MT-prepared gradient echo sequence in 33 controls, 83 non-manifest carriers (42 LRRK2 and 41 GBA nonmanifest carriers), 65 prodromal hyposmic participants, 105 de novo PD patients and 26 48-month PD patients from the Parkinsons Progressive Markers Initiative. No difference in nigral volume was seen between controls and LRRK2 and GBA non-manifest carriers (F=0.076; P=0.927). A significant main effect in group was observed between controls, prodromal hyposmic participants, and overt PD patients (F=5.192; P=0.002). Longer disease duration significantly correlated with lower nigral volume (r=-0.252; P=0.010). This study shows that nigral depigmentation can be robustly detected in prodromal hyposmic participants and overt PD patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD) aim to reduce the rate of progression of disease. This is heavily dependent on a consensus of a minimum clinically important difference as well as the ability of the cognitive and functional measures used to accurately measure progression.

In this study we perform a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the precision of measurement of AD clinical progression in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry.

Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) in AD, with amyloid positive status (A{beta}&#43;) as an inclusion criterion, were undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Whilst most RCTS enrolled prodromal or mild AD patients with an average MMSE score at baseline of 27, several included average MMSE scores as low as 22. We performed meta regressions, correcting for age, gender, and stage of disease in R version 4.2.0, using the metafor and emmeans libraries. Of the progression measures included in the meta-analyses, the FAQ, a functional measure, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE, whilst the most commonly used neuropsychiatric battery, NPI, failed to show sensitivity to change in the given time period. This study emphasises the necessity of appropriate composite progression measures that weigh cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms according to their ability to detect meaningful change in symptoms and thus have a better chance of detecting meaningful change in participants of interventional RCTs.

SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disease. It is now widely recognised that there is a pre-clinical phase. This phase of the disease may be apparent via biomarker testing up to 20 years before clinically evident AD. Pre-clinical AD is then followed by clinically significant cognitive decline ranging from MCI to severe AD.

The aim of randomised controlled trials (RCT) is to reduce or halt the rate of clinical progression of AD. Most of these trials have been unsuccessful. To determine the effectiveness of treatments there must be robust and reliable tools for measuring AD progression. For at least 30 years there has been recognition that the measures of progression used in AD clinical trials are problematic.

A significant concern is that current measures of clinical progression are potentially not sensitive enough in early and preclinical stages of AD and so are not reliable indicators of AD progression.

In this systematic review and meta-regression we aimed to assess the precision of measurements of clinical progression in AD clinical trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with known positive amyloid status prior to trial entry.

MethodsMeta analyses of RCTs in AD with amyloid positive status (A{beta}&#43;) as an inclusion criterion was undertaken with functional, cognitive, and composite measures included in the analyses. Twenty-five RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0 and the metafor and emmeans libraries.

FindingsOf the progression measures commonly reported in RCTs, the FAQ, had the largest weighted mean change over 12-weeks followed by MMSE. Other cognitive measures were amongst the least sensitive measures over the chosen time period. As a composite score, both the iADRS and CDRSB appear to be performing better than the cognitive components they comprise. The neuropsychiatric battery analysed in this study appeared to be the least sensitive of measures of progression.

InterpretationFunctional measures, with the exception of QoL-AD, perform better than other groups of measures. Measures which rely on purely cognitive domains are not optimal for sole use in AD trials. Ideally, measures should include both cognitive and functional components to enhance sensitivity. New composite measures address the poorer performance of composite scores, as compared to their comprising functional measures, by assigning different weights to cognitive and functional change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPatient education is an essential component of healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) language models such as Google Bard and Microsoft Bing have the potential to improve information transmission and enhance patient care. However, it is crucial to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and understandability of the materials generated by these models before applying them in medical practice. This study aimed to assess and compare the quality of patient education materials produced by Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in response to questions related to neurological conditions.

MethodsA cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate and compare the ability of Google Bard and Microsoft Bing to generate patient education materials. The study included the top ten prevalent neurological diseases based on WHO prevalence data. Ten board-certified neurologists and four neurology residents evaluated the responses generated by the models on six quality metrics. The scores for each model were compiled and averaged across all measures, and the significance of any observed variations was assessed using an independent t-test.

ResultsGoogle Bard performed better than Microsoft Bing in all six-quality metrics, with an overall mean score of 79% and 69%, respectively. Google Bard outperformed Microsoft Bing in all measures for eight questions, while Microsoft Bing performed marginally better in terms of objectivity and clarity for the epilepsy query.

ConclusionThis study showed that Google Bard performs better than Microsoft Bing in generating patient education materials for neurological diseases. However, healthcare professionals should take into account both AI models advantages and disadvantages when providing support for health information requirements. Future studies can help determine the underlying causes of these variations and guide cooperative initiatives to create more user-focused AI-generated patient education materials. Finally, researchers should consider the perception of patients regarding AI-generated patient education material and its impact on implementing these solutions in healthcare settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and PurposeChronic hemiparetic stroke patients have very limited benefits from current therapies. Brain-computer interface (BCI) engaging the unaffected hemisphere has emerged as a promising novel therapeutic approach for chronic stroke rehabilitation. This study investigated the effectiveness of the IpsiHand System, a contralesionally-controlled BCI therapy in chronic stroke patients with impaired upper extremity motor function. We further explored neurophysiological features of motor recovery affected by BCI. We hypothesized that BCI therapy would induce a broad motor recovery in the upper extremity (proximal and distal), and there would be corresponding changes in baseline theta and gamma oscillations, which have been shown to be associated with motor recovery.

MethodsThirty chronic hemiparetic stroke patients performed a therapeutic BCI task for 12 weeks. Motor function assessment data and resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were acquired before initiating BCI therapy and across BCI therapy sessions. The Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer assessment (UEFM) served as a primary motor outcome assessment tool. Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was computed and correlated with motor recovery.

ResultsChronic stroke patients achieved significant motor improvement with BCI therapy. We found significant improvement in both proximal and distal upper extremity motor function. Importantly, motor function improvement was independent of Botox application. Theta-gamma CFC enhanced bilaterally over the C3 and C4 motor electrodes following BCI therapy. We observed significant positive correlations between motor recovery and theta gamma CFC increase across BCI therapy sessions.

ConclusionsBCI therapy resulted in significant motor function improvement across the proximal and distal upper extremities of patients. This therapy was significantly correlated with changes in baseline cortical dynamics, specifically theta-gamma CFC increases in both the right and left motor regions. This may represent rhythm-specific cortical oscillatory mechanism for BCI-driven motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Paediatric status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity. Benzodiazepines (BZPs) are the current first-line treatment, but do not work in over a third of children presenting with SE. Animal studies have shown that SE can cause changes in synaptic inhibition signalling which can ultimately lead to BZPs becoming ineffective. However, the relevance of these mechanisms in paediatric patients with SE remains unknown. To test this hypothesis, we combine clinical EEG recordings with dynamic causal modelling (DCM). This approach allows model-based inference of cortical synaptic coupling parameters based on EEG recorded across distinct oscillatory states. Our DCM revealed that dynamic changes in inhibitory synaptic coupling explain differences in EEG power spectra associated with BZP-treatment responsiveness, and guide the transition from ictal to interictal state. Furthermore, in silico simulations demonstrate that there are alternative routes to seizure termination even in cortical circuit models unresponsive to the BZPs. Together, our findings confirm that alterations in synaptic inhibition underlie BZP response during paediatric SE. More broadly this work further demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to validate insights from basic science in clinically accessible recordings in neurological disorders characterised by abnormal brain states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1.Deep brain stimulation is a widely used therapy for Parkinsons disease (PD) but currently lacks dynamic responsiveness to changing clinical and neural states. Feedback control has the potential to improve therapeutic effectiveness, but optimal control strategy and additional benefits of &#34;adaptive&#34; neurostimulation are unclear. We implemented adaptive subthalamic nucleus stimulation, controlled by subthalamic or cortical signals, in three PD patients (five hemispheres) during normal daily life. We identified neurophysiological biomarkers of residual motor fluctuations using data-driven analyses of field potentials over a wide frequency range and varying stimulation amplitudes. Narrowband gamma oscillations (65-70 Hz) at either site emerged as the best control signal for sensing during stimulation. A blinded, randomized trial demonstrated improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared to clinically optimized standard stimulation. Our approach highlights the promise of personalized adaptive neurostimulation based on data-driven selection of control signals and may be applied to other neurological disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceMyasthenic crisis (MC) is a critical progression of Myasthenia gravis (MG), requiring intensive care treatment and invasive therapies. Classifying patients at high-risk for MC facilitates treatment decisions and helps prevent disease progression.

ObjectiveTo test whether machine learning models trained with real-world routine clinical data can aid precisely identifying MG patients at risk for MC.

DesignThis is a pseudo-prospective cohort study of MG patients presenting since January 2010.

SettingSingle center.

ParticipantsA cohort of 51 MG patients was used for model training based on a defined set of real-world clinical data. The cohort was created from a convenience sample of 13 MC patients matched based on sex, five-year age band, antibody status, thymus pathology with MG patients who had not suffered an MC. Data analyses and model refinements were performed from June 2022 to May 2023.

ExposureClassification of MG patients to high or low risk for MC using Lasso regression or random forest machine learning models.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe accuracy of the risk classification was assessed by patient.

ResultsThis study included 51 MG patients (13 MC, 38 non-MC; median age MC group 70.5, non-MC group 65.5). The mean cross-validated AUC classifying MG patients as high or low risk for MC based on simple or compound features derived from real-world routine clinical data showed a predictive accuracy of 68.8% for the regularized Lasso regression and of 76.5% for the random forest model. Feature importance scores suggest that multimorbidity may play a role in risk classification. Different thresholds were applied to tune model performance to optimal parameters. Studying result stability across 100 runs further indicated that the random forest model was better suited to cope with feature variance. Studying feature importance across 5100 model runs identified explainable features to distinguish MG patients at high or low risk for MC.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, feasibility of classifying risk for MC based on real-world routine clinical data using machine learning was shown. The models showed accurate and consistent performance indicating the utility of personalized risk assessment in MG patients using machine learning models.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning models be used to classify Myasthenia gravis patients into groups at high or low risk for myasthenic crisis with high precision based on explainable data-driven features derived from real-world clinical data?

FindingsIn this pseudo-prospective study of 51 Myasthenia gravis patients, the risk of myasthenic crisis using real-world clinical data was accurately classified employing two machine learning models with explainable features.

MeaningThese findings suggest that it is possible to classify the risk for myasthenic crisis in patients based on real-world clinical data with high precision.</p>
