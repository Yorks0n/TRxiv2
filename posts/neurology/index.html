D.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299829\nObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables. ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores. ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.\nBiomarker changes preceding symptom onset in genetic prion disease\nAuthors: Vallabh, S. M.; Mortberg, M. A.; Allen, S. W.; Kupferschmid, A. C.; Kivisakk, P.; Hammerschlag, B. L.; Bolling, A.; Trombetta, B. A.; Devitte-McKee, K.; Ford, A. M.; Sather, L.; Duffy, G.; Rivera, A.; Gerber, J.; McManus, A. J.; Minikel, E. V.; Arnold, S. E.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300042\nImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset. ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls. Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study. Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma. ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints. Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset? FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity. MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.\nCardiac Troponin T is a Serum Biomarker of Respiratory Dysfunction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nAuthors: Koch, T.; Fabian, R.; Weinhold, L.; Koch, F. W.; Barakat, S.; Castro-Gomez, S.; Grehl, T.; Bernsen, S.; Weydt, P.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.23300684\nObjective: Informative biomarkers are an urgent need in management and therapy development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Serum cardiac troponin T is elevated in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and not correlated with neurofilaments. We sought to delineate the functional implications and the informative value of serum troponin T with regard to respiratory function, a major prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: We analyzed two independent hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts (d=discovery cohort; v= validation cohort) with data available on serum cardiac troponin T levels (nd=297; nv=49), serum neurofilament light chain levels (nd=116; nv=17), and routine respiratory test results (nd=86; nv=49). Results: Serum cardiac troponin T levels, unlike serum neurofilaments, were strongly associated with the respiratory domain of the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating score (rd = - 0.29, pd = 0.001; rv= - 0.48, pv = 0.007) and with relevant pulmonary function parameters (nd), namely SVC% (r = - 0.45; p = 0.001), FVC% (r = - 0.43; p = 0.001), FEV1% (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and PEF (r = - 0.34, p = 0.027). Serum cardiac Troponin T reliably discriminated benchmarks of SVC% \u003c 80%: (AUC 0.75, p = 0.003), FVC % \u003c 80%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.011) and PEF% \u003c75%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.015). Interpretation: Our findings confirm cardiac Troponin T as an informative serum biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, complementing neurofilaments. Serum Troponin T can flag compromised respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and might prove useful as a proxy of respiratory impairment with prognostic implications.\nPrognostic biomarkers of intracerebral hemorrhage identified using targeted proteomics and machine learning algorithms\nAuthors: Misra, S.; Kawamura, Y.; Singh, P.; Sengupta, S.; Nath, M.; Rahman, Z.; Kumar, P.; Kumar, A.; Aggarwal, P.; Srivastava, A. K.; Pandit, A. K.; Mohania, D.; Prasad, K.; Mishra, N. K.; Vibha, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300465\nEarly prognostication of patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is critical for patient care. We aim to investigate protein biomarkers role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N=150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3-6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (aOR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41-35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.57; 1.26-24.59), and Serpin-A11 (9.33; 1.09-79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (6.32; 1.82-21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 1.24-3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (1.98; 1.19-3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Using machine learning, UCH-L1 and APO-C1 predicted 90-day mortality, and UCH-L1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 predicted 180-day mortality. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multiomics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis.\nUsing Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech\nAuthors: Rezaii, N.; Quimby, M.; Wong, B.; Hochberg, D.; Brickhouse, M.; Touroutoglou, A.; Dickerson, B. C.; Wolff, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300470\nNeurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy. One sentence summaryComputational linguistic analyses of naturalistic speech samples can classify the aphasic variant of patients similarly to expert clinicians and identify well-established and novel linguistic features crucial for classification.\nHarmonic patterns embedding ictal EEG signals in focal epilepsy: a new insight into the epileptogenic zone\nAuthors: Hu, L.; Ye, L.; Ye, H.; Liu, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zheng, Z.; Jiang, H.; Chen, C.; Wang, Z.; Zhu, J.; Chen, Z.; Yang, D.; Wang, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300274\nThe ictal EEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) need to be better defined. The power and structure of ictal fast activity are important in EZ localization, but EEG onset patterns are heterogeneous and initial fast activity is absent in many patients. Here we defined a unique spectral structure of \"harmonic pattern\" (H pattern) on stereo-EEG (SEEG), characterized by multiple equidistant, high-density bands with varying frequency on time frequency map. H pattern was commonly observed among 57 (81.4%) out of 70 patients with focal onset pattern on SEEG. It was presented in seizures with various ictal onset patterns with or without fast activity, and during early or late stage of seizures. H pattern usually expressed at very close time point across the seizure onset zone (SOZ), primary propagation zone and sometimes other areas, with the same fundamental difference, reflecting an inter-regional synchronization within the ictal network during this time. Notably, SOZ showed the highest proportion of channels expressing H-pattern, and also highest band number of H-pattern. At patient level, the dominant H pattern was defined as those with high rank in band numbers (the third quartile, Q3). Resection of the region expressing dominant H pattern, but not SOZ, independently predicted seizure freedom after surgery, suggesting it is an ictal marker of EZ. How H pattern was produced was then investigated. It only embedded into two types of EEG segments: fast activity with a frequency \u003e25Hz (FA-H pattern) at early seizure propagation (mean 13.3 sec after onset), and irregular polyspikes (\u003e 5 Hz, PS-H pattern) during late propagation (mean 23.3 sec after onset). Nonlinear analysis was used to unravel the mechanism underlying H pattern generation. Our data showed it was produced by specific nonlinear phenomena rather than intermodulation of frequencies or purely methodological artefact. The nonlinearity was stronger for dominant compared to non-dominant H pattern. According to the spectral parameters, we postulate that FA-H pattern may be supported by a predominant and synchronized firing of GABAergic neurons, while excitatory neuron firing is more important for PS-H pattern. As a distinctive and common ictal spectral feature, H pattern conveys unique information of ictal neural dynamics and provides new insights into the EZ. Our study also provides evidence that there is an elongated time-window to measure EZ using quantitative EEG.\nAn accurate and rapidly calibrating speech neuroprosthesis\nAuthors: Card, N. S.; Wairagkar, M.; Iaccobacci, C.; Hou, X.; Singer-Clark, T.; Willett, F. R.; Kunz, E. M.; Fan, C.; Vahdati Nia, M.; Deo, D. R.; Choi, E. Y.; Glasser, M. F.; Hochberg, L. R.; Henderson, J. M.; Shahlaie, K.; Brandman, D. M.; Stavisky, S. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23300110\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a rapid, intuitive way for people with paralysis to communicate by transforming the cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text. Despite recent advances, communication with BCIs has been restricted by requiring many weeks of training data, and by inadequate decoding accuracy. Here we report a speech BCI that decodes neural activity from 256 microelectrodes in the left precentral gyrus of a person with ALS and severe dysarthria. This system achieves daily word error rates as low as 1% (2.66% average; 9 times fewer errors than previous state-of-the-art speech BCIs) using a comprehensive 125,000-word vocabulary. On the first day of system use, following only 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the BCI achieved 99.6% word accuracy with a 50 word vocabulary. On the second day of use, we increased the vocabulary size to 125,000 words and after an additional 1.4 hours of training data, the BCI achieved 90.2% word accuracy. At the beginning of subsequent days of use, the BCI reliably achieved 95% word accuracy, and adaptive online fine-tuning continuously improved this accuracy throughout the day. Our participant used the speech BCI in self-paced conversation for over 32 hours to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues (both in-person and over video chat). These results indicate that speech BCIs have reached a level of performance suitable to restore naturalistic communication to people living with severe dysarthria.\nPrevalence of orthostatic intolerance in Long Covid clinic patients - A multicentre observational study\nAuthors: Lee, C.; Greenwood, D.; Master, H.; Balasundaram, K.; Williams, P.; Scott, J.; Wood, C.; Cooper, R.; Darbyshire, J.; Espinosa Gonzalez, A.; Davies, H.; Osborne, T.; Corrado, J.; Iftekhar, N.; Rogers, N.; Delaney, B. C.; Greenhalgh, T.; Sivan, M.; LOCOMOTION Consortium, Score: 32.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23299958\nPurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities. MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded. Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers. ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

MethodsThe study involved 72 MS patients with at least a 5-year follow-up. Annual assessments used 3D FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast 3D T1, and diffusion-weighted MRI. Lesion segmentation was conducted using iQ-MSTM software, while brain structures were segmented using AssemblyNet. Volumetric changes in CLT were tracked using a custom-designed pipeline. ResultsThroughout the follow-up period, the volume of CLT in the entire cohort increased continuously and steadily, averaging 7.75{+/-}8.2% or 315{+/-}465 mm3 per year. Patients with expanding CLT experienced significantly faster brain atrophy, affecting both white and grey matter, particularly in the brains central area. Expanded CLT was also associated with higher and worsening EDSS scores, in contrast to the stable CLT group, where EDSS remained unchanged. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that, over a period of up to 7 years, patient-specific enlargement of CLT, where present, progresses at a constant rate and significantly influences disease progression.\nPrecision Brain Morphometry Using Cluster Scanning\nAuthors: Elliott, M. L.; Nielsen, J.; Hanford, L.; Hamadeh, A.; Hilbert, T.; Kober, T.; Dickerson, B. C.; Hyman, B.; Mair, R.; Eldaief, M.; Buckner, R. L.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.23300492\nMeasurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans ([~]1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as \"cluster scanning.\" Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and volumetric imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Patients and MethodsPatients presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital between February 14, 2017 and February 5, 2020 with a confirmed AIS by MRI were eligible and underwent a telephone interview including PROM-10 questionnaires 3-15 months after stroke. White matter hyperintensity (VWMH) and brain volumes (VBrain) were automatically determined using admission clinical MRI. Stroke lesions were manually segmented and volumes calculated (VLesion). Multivariable and ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify associations between global and PROM-10 subscores with brain volumetrics and clinical variables.

ResultsUtilizing data from 167 patients (mean age: 64.7; 41.9% female), higher VWMH was associated with worse global physical ({beta}=-0.6), global mental ({beta}=-0.65), physical health (OR=0.68), social satisfaction (OR=0.66), fatigue (OR=0.69) and social activities (OR=0.59) scores. Higher VLesion was associated with poorer global mental ({beta}=-0.79), mental health (OR=0.68), physical (OR=0.66) and social activities (OR=0.55), and emotional distress (OR=0.68) scores. Higher VBrain was linked to better global mental ({beta}=0.93), global physical ({beta}=0.79), mental health (OR=1.54) and physical activities (OR=1.72) scores.

ConclusionsNeuroimaging biomarkers were significantly associated with PROMs, where higher VWMH and VLesion led to worse outcome, while higher VBrain was protective. The inclusion of neuroimaging analyses and PROMs in routine assessment provides enhanced understanding of post-stroke outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceGenetic prion disease is a universally fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which genetically targeted therapies are currently under development. Preclinical proofs of concept indicate that treatment before symptoms will offer outsize benefit. Though early treatment paradigms will be informed by the longitudinal biomarker trajectory of mutation carriers, to date limited cases have been molecularly tracked from the presymptomatic phase through symptomatic onset.

ObjectiveTo longitudinally characterize disease-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease up to disease conversion, alongside non-converters and healthy controls.

Design, setting, and participantsThis single-center longitudinal cohort study has followed 41 PRNP mutation carriers and 21 controls for up to 6 years. Participants spanned a range of known pathogenic PRNP variants; all subjects were asymptomatic at first visit and returned roughly annually. Four at-risk individuals experienced prion disease onset during the study.

Main outcomes and measuresRT-QuIC prion seeding activity, prion protein (PrP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) total tau (t-tau), and beta synuclein were measured in CSF. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL were measured in plasma.

ResultsWe observed RT-QuIC seeding activity in the CSF of three E200K carriers prior to symptom onset and death, while the CSF of one P102L carrier remained RT-QuIC negative through symptom conversion. The prodromal window of RT-QuIC positivity was one year long in an E200K individual homozygous (V/V) at PRNP codon 129 and was longer than two years in two codon 129 heterozygotes (M/V). Other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers gave less consistent signal prior to symptom onset, whether analyzed relative to age or individual baseline. CSF PrP was longitudinally stable (mean CV 10%) across all individuals over up to 6 years, including at RT-QuIC positive timepoints.

Conclusion and relevanceIn this study, we demonstrate that at least for the E200K mutation, CSF prion seeding activity may represent the earliest detectable prodromal sign, and that its prognostic value may be modified by codon 129 genotype. Neuronal damage and neuroinflammation markers show limited sensitivity in the prodromal phase. CSF PrP levels remain stable even in the presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat biofluid-based molecular changes precede symptom onset in genetic prion disease? For any observed changes, how consistently and by how long do they precede onset?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study, presymptomatic CSF RT-QuIC prion seeding activity was observed in three E200K carriers who subsequently developed and died of prion disease, with changes in prodromal timing noted based on PRNP codon 129 genotype. CSF PrP levels were longitudinally stable in all study participants up to 6 years, regardless of mutation status or presence of RT-QuIC seeding activity.

MeaningThese findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC may offer a brief, genotype-dependent prodromal signal prior to symptom onset in carriers of the E200K mutation. They further indicate that across PRNP mutations, CSF PrP levels are sufficiently stable to serve as a drug activity biomarker for PrP-lowering therapeutics and will not be confounded by disease-related molecular changes that precede symptom onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Informative biomarkers are an urgent need in management and therapy development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Serum cardiac troponin T is elevated in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and not correlated with neurofilaments. We sought to delineate the functional implications and the informative value of serum troponin T with regard to respiratory function, a major prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: We analyzed two independent hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts (d=discovery cohort; v= validation cohort) with data available on serum cardiac troponin T levels (nd=297; nv=49), serum neurofilament light chain levels (nd=116; nv=17), and routine respiratory test results (nd=86; nv=49). Results: Serum cardiac troponin T levels, unlike serum neurofilaments, were strongly associated with the respiratory domain of the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating score (rd = - 0.29, pd = 0.001; rv= - 0.48, pv = 0.007) and with relevant pulmonary function parameters (nd), namely SVC% (r = - 0.45; p = 0.001), FVC% (r = - 0.43; p = 0.001), FEV1% (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and PEF (r = - 0.34, p = 0.027). Serum cardiac Troponin T reliably discriminated benchmarks of SVC% &lt; 80%: (AUC 0.75, p = 0.003), FVC % &lt; 80%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.011) and PEF% &lt;75%: (AUC 0.72, p = 0.015). Interpretation: Our findings confirm cardiac Troponin T as an informative serum biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, complementing neurofilaments. Serum Troponin T can flag compromised respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and might prove useful as a proxy of respiratory impairment with prognostic implications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early prognostication of patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is critical for patient care. We aim to investigate protein biomarkers role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N=150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3-6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (aOR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41-35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.57; 1.26-24.59), and Serpin-A11 (9.33; 1.09-79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (6.32; 1.82-21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 1.24-3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (1.98; 1.19-3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Using machine learning, UCH-L1 and APO-C1 predicted 90-day mortality, and UCH-L1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 predicted 180-day mortality. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multiomics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.

One sentence summaryComputational linguistic analyses of naturalistic speech samples can classify the aphasic variant of patients similarly to expert clinicians and identify well-established and novel linguistic features crucial for classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ictal EEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) need to be better defined. The power and structure of ictal fast activity are important in EZ localization, but EEG onset patterns are heterogeneous and initial fast activity is absent in many patients. Here we defined a unique spectral structure of &#34;harmonic pattern&#34; (H pattern) on stereo-EEG (SEEG), characterized by multiple equidistant, high-density bands with varying frequency on time frequency map. H pattern was commonly observed among 57 (81.4%) out of 70 patients with focal onset pattern on SEEG. It was presented in seizures with various ictal onset patterns with or without fast activity, and during early or late stage of seizures. H pattern usually expressed at very close time point across the seizure onset zone (SOZ), primary propagation zone and sometimes other areas, with the same fundamental difference, reflecting an inter-regional synchronization within the ictal network during this time. Notably, SOZ showed the highest proportion of channels expressing H-pattern, and also highest band number of H-pattern. At patient level, the dominant H pattern was defined as those with high rank in band numbers (the third quartile, Q3). Resection of the region expressing dominant H pattern, but not SOZ, independently predicted seizure freedom after surgery, suggesting it is an ictal marker of EZ. How H pattern was produced was then investigated. It only embedded into two types of EEG segments: fast activity with a frequency &gt;25Hz (FA-H pattern) at early seizure propagation (mean 13.3 sec after onset), and irregular polyspikes (&gt; 5 Hz, PS-H pattern) during late propagation (mean 23.3 sec after onset). Nonlinear analysis was used to unravel the mechanism underlying H pattern generation. Our data showed it was produced by specific nonlinear phenomena rather than intermodulation of frequencies or purely methodological artefact. The nonlinearity was stronger for dominant compared to non-dominant H pattern. According to the spectral parameters, we postulate that FA-H pattern may be supported by a predominant and synchronized firing of GABAergic neurons, while excitatory neuron firing is more important for PS-H pattern. As a distinctive and common ictal spectral feature, H pattern conveys unique information of ictal neural dynamics and provides new insights into the EZ. Our study also provides evidence that there is an elongated time-window to measure EZ using quantitative EEG.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a rapid, intuitive way for people with paralysis to communicate by transforming the cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text. Despite recent advances, communication with BCIs has been restricted by requiring many weeks of training data, and by inadequate decoding accuracy. Here we report a speech BCI that decodes neural activity from 256 microelectrodes in the left precentral gyrus of a person with ALS and severe dysarthria. This system achieves daily word error rates as low as 1% (2.66% average; 9 times fewer errors than previous state-of-the-art speech BCIs) using a comprehensive 125,000-word vocabulary. On the first day of system use, following only 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the BCI achieved 99.6% word accuracy with a 50 word vocabulary. On the second day of use, we increased the vocabulary size to 125,000 words and after an additional 1.4 hours of training data, the BCI achieved 90.2% word accuracy. At the beginning of subsequent days of use, the BCI reliably achieved 95% word accuracy, and adaptive online fine-tuning continuously improved this accuracy throughout the day. Our participant used the speech BCI in self-paced conversation for over 32 hours to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues (both in-person and over video chat). These results indicate that speech BCIs have reached a level of performance suitable to restore naturalistic communication to people living with severe dysarthria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeOrthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), are often reported in long covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long covid clinics and healthy volunteers and associations with symptoms and comorbidities.

MethodsParticipants were recruited from 8 UK long covid clinics, and healthy volunteers from general population. All undertook standardised National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) prior to and during the NLT were recorded.

Results277 long covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or PoTS, 10% had asymptomatic OH. 130 (47%) long covid patients had previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. 41 (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive to one reading, resulted in 11% of long covid participants meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers.

ConclusionMore than half of long covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in ten patients met the criteria for either PoTS or OH, half of whom did not report previous typical OI symptoms. We recommend all patients attending long covid clinics are offered an NLT and appropriate management commenced.

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectiveThis study examines the long-term changes in Chronic Lesion Tissue (CLT) among relapsing and remitting MS (RRMS) patients, focusing on its impact on clinical and radiological disease progression indicators.

MethodsThe study involved 72 MS patients with at least a 5-year follow-up. Annual assessments used 3D FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast 3D T1, and diffusion-weighted MRI. Lesion segmentation was conducted using iQ-MSTM software, while brain structures were segmented using AssemblyNet. Volumetric changes in CLT were tracked using a custom-designed pipeline.

ResultsThroughout the follow-up period, the volume of CLT in the entire cohort increased continuously and steadily, averaging 7.75{&#43;/-}8.2% or 315{&#43;/-}465 mm3 per year. Patients with expanding CLT experienced significantly faster brain atrophy, affecting both white and grey matter, particularly in the brains central area. Expanded CLT was also associated with higher and worsening EDSS scores, in contrast to the stable CLT group, where EDSS remained unchanged.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that, over a period of up to 7 years, patient-specific enlargement of CLT, where present, progresses at a constant rate and significantly influences disease progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Measurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans ([~]1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as &#34;cluster scanning.&#34; Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.</p>
