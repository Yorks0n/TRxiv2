Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.\nAge-dependent increase in tau phosphorylation at serine 396 in Huntington s disease pre-frontal cortex\nAuthors: Petrozziello, T.; Huntress, S. S.; Castillo-Torres, A. L.; Quinn, J. P.; Connors, T. R.; Auger, C. A.; Mills, A. N.; Kim, S. E.; Liu, S.; Mahmood, F.; Boudi, A.; Wu, M.; Sapp, E.; Kivisakk, P.; Sunderesh, S. R.; Pouladi, M. A.; Arnold, S. E.; Hyman, B. T.; Rosas, H. D.; DiFiglia, M.; Mouro Pinto, R.; Kegel-Gleason, K.; Sadri-Vakili, G.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-06-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.03.23290851\nBackgroundTo date, it is still controversial whether tau phosphorylation plays a role in Huntingtons disease (HD), as previous studies demonstrated either no alterations or increases in phosphorylated tau (pTau) in HD post-mortem brain and mouse models. ObjectivesThe goal of this study was to determine whether total tau and pTau levels are altered in HD. MethodsImmunohistochemistry, cellular fractionations, and western blots were used to measure tau and pTau levels in a large cohort of HD and control post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, western blots were performed to assess tau, and pTau levels in HD and control isogenic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons and neuronal stem cells (NSCs). Similarly, western blots were used to assess tau and pTau in HttQ111 and transgenic R6/2 mice. Lastly, total tau levels were assessed in HD and healthy control plasma using Quanterix Simoa assay. ResultsOur results revealed that, while there was no difference in tau or pTau levels in HD PFC compared to controls, tau phosphorylated at S396 levels were increased in PFC samples from HD patients 60 years or older at time of death. Additionally, tau and pTau levels were not changed in HD ESC-derived cortical neurons and NSCs. Similarly, tau or pTau levels were not altered in HttQ111 and transgenic R6/2 mice compared to wild-type littermates. Lastly, tau levels were not changed in plasma from a small cohort of HD patients compared to controls. ConclusionTogether these findings demonstrate that pTau-S396 levels increase significantly with age in HD PFC.\nTherapeutic potential of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet in reversing the peripheral lipid signature of Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Neth, B.

Although previous studies have suggested that certain diets may reduce the incidence of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this randomized crossover study of 20 elderly adults, we investigated the effects of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on the plasma lipidome, analyzing 784 lipid species across 47 classes. We identified substantial changes in response to intervention, notably a global elevation across all plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipid species among others, with many changes linked with changes to clinical and biochemical markers of AD. Leveraging our prior clinical studies on AD (n = 1,912), we found that MMKD was inversely associated with the lipidomic signature of prevalent and incident AD. Given its low risk and cost, MMKD could be a promising approach for prevention or early symptomatic treatment of AD.\nPersonalising Alzheimer's Disease progression using brain atrophy markers\nAuthors: Verdi, S.; Rutherford, S.; Fraza, C. J.; Tosun, D.; Altmann, A.; Raket, L. L.; Schott, J. M.; Marquand, A. F.; Cole, J. H.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-06-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291418\nINTRODUCTION: Neuroanatomical normative modelling can capture individual variability in Alzheimers Disease (AD). We used neuroanatomical normative modelling to track individuals disease progression in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD. METHODS: Cortical thickness and subcortical volume neuroanatomical normative models were generated using healthy controls (n[~]58k). These models were used to calculate regional Z-scores in 4361 T1-weighted MRI time-series scans. Regions with Z-scores \u003c-1.96 were classified as outliers and mapped on the brain, and also summarised by total outlier count (tOC). RESULTS: Rate of change in tOC increased in AD and in people with MCI who converted to AD and correlated with multiple non-imaging markers. Moreover, a higher annual rate of change in tOC increased the risk of MCI progression to AD. Brain Z-score maps showed that the hippocampus had the highest rate of atrophy change. CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level atrophy rates can be tracked by using regional outlier maps and tOC.\nUnsupervised machine-learning identifies clinically distinct subtypes of ALS that reflect different genetic architectures and biological mechanisms\nAuthors: Spargo, T. P.; Marriott, H.; Hunt, G.; Pain, O.; Kabiljo, R.; Bowles, H.; Sproviero, W.; Gillett, A. C.; Fogh, I.; Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium, ; Andersen, P. M.; Basak, N. A.; Shaw, P.; Corcia, P.; Couratier, P.; de Carvalho, M.; Drory, V.; Glass, J. D.; Gotkine, M.; hardiman, O.; Landers, J. E.; McLaughlin, R.; Mora Pardina, J. S.; Morrison, K. E.; Pinto, S.; Povedano, M.; Shaw, C. E.; Silani, V.; Ticozzi, N.; van Damme, P.; van den Berg, L. h.; Vourch, P.; Weber, M.; Veldink, J.; Dobson, R.; Al Khleifat, A.; Cummis, N.; Stahl, D.; Al-Chalabi, A.; Iacoangeli, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-06-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291304\nBackgroundAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by a highly variable clinical presentation and multifaceted genetic and biological bases that translate into great patient heterogeneity. The identification of homogeneous subgroups of patients in terms of both clinical presentation and biological causes, could favour the development of effective treatments, healthcare, and clinical trials. We aimed to identify and characterise homogenous clinical subgroups of ALS, examining whether they represent underlying biological trends. MethodsLatent class clustering analysis, an unsupervised machine-learning method, was used to identify homogenous subpopulations in 6,523 people with ALS from Project MinE, using widely collected ALS-related clinical variables. The clusters were validated using 7,829 independent patients from STRENGTH. We tested whether the identified subgroups were associated with biological trends in genetic variation across genes previously linked to ALS, polygenic risk scores of ALS and related neuropsychiatric traits, and in gene expression data from post-mortem motor cortex samples. ResultsWe identified five ALS subgroups based on patterns in clinical data which were general across international datasets. Distinct genetic trends were observed for rare variants in the SOD1 and C9orf72 genes, and across genes implicated in biological processes relevant to ALS. Polygenic risk scores of ALS, schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease were also higher in distinct clusters with respect to controls. Gene expression analysis identified different altered biological processes across clusters reflecting the genetic differences. We developed a machine learning classifier based on our model to assign subgroup membership using clinical data available at first visit, and made it available on a public webserver at http://latentclusterals.er.kcl.ac.uk. ConclusionALS subgroups characterised by highly distinct clinical presentations were discovered and validated in two large independent international datasets. Such groups were also characterised by different underlying genetic architectures and biology. Our results showed that data-driven patient stratification into more clinically and biologically homogeneous subtypes of ALS is possible and could help develop more effective and targeted approaches to the biomedical and clinical study of ALS.\nMapping the relationship of white matter lesions to depression in multiple sclerosis\nAuthors: Baller, E. B.; Sweeney, E. M.; Cieslak, M. C.; Robert-Fitzgerald, T.; Covitz, S. C.; Martin, M. L.; Schindler, M. K.; Bar-Or, A.; Elahie, A.; Larsen, B. S.; Manning, A. R.; Markowitz, C. E.; Perrone, C. M.; Rautman, V.; Seitz, M.; Detre, J. A.; Fox, M. D.; Shinohara, R. T.; Satterthwaite, T. D.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23291080\nImportanceMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects nearly one million people in the United States. Up to 50% of patients with MS experience depression. ObjectiveTo investigate how white matter network disruption is related to depression in MS. DesignRetrospective case-control study of participants who received research-quality 3-tesla neuroimaging as part of MS clinical care from 2010-2018. Analyses were performed from May 1 to September 30, 2022. SettingSingle-center academic medical specialty MS clinic. ParticipantsParticipants with MS were identified via the electronic health record (EHR). All participants were diagnosed by an MS specialist and completed research-quality MRI at 3T. After excluding participants with poor image quality, 783 were included. Inclusion in the depression group (MS+Depression) required either: 1) ICD-10 depression diagnosis (F32-F34.*); 2) prescription of antidepressant medication; or 3) screening positive via Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or -9 (PHQ-9). Age- and sex-matched nondepressed comparators (MS-Depression) included persons with no depression diagnosis, no psychiatric medications, and were asymptomatic on PHQ-2/9. ExposureDepression diagnosis. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)We first evaluated if lesions were preferentially located within the depression network compared to other brain regions. Next, we examined if MS+Depression patients had greater lesion burden, and if this was driven by lesions specifically in the depression network. Outcome measures were the burden of lesions (e.g., impacted fascicles) within a network and across the brain. Secondary measures included between-diagnosis lesion burden, stratified by brain network. Linear mixed-effects models were employed. ResultsThree hundred-eighty participants met inclusion criteria, (232 MS+Depression: age[SD]=49[12], %females=86; 148 MS-Depression: age[SD]=47[13], %females=79). MS lesions preferentially affected fascicles within versus outside the depression network ({beta}=0.09, 95% CI=0.08-0.10, P\u003c0.001). MS+Depression had more white matter lesion burden ({beta}=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10, P=0.015); this was driven by lesions within the depression network ({beta}=0.02, 95% CI 0.003-0.040, P=0.020). Conclusions and RelevanceWe provide new evidence supporting a relationship between white matter lesions and depression in MS. MS lesions disproportionately impacted fascicles in the depression network. MS+Depression had more disease than MS-Depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network. Future studies relating lesion location to personalized depression interventions are warranted. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre white matter lesions that impact fascicles connecting a previously-described depression network associated with depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)? FindingsIn this retrospective, case-control study of patients with MS including 232 patients with depression and 148 nondepressed MS comparators, patients with MS had more disease within the depression network, irrespective of depression diagnosis. Patients with depression had more disease than those without depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network specifically. MeaningLesion location and burden may contribute to depression comorbidity in MS.\nDNAJC12 in monoamine metabolism, neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration\nAuthors: Deng, I. B.; Follett, J.; Bu, M.; Farrer, M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291747\nRecent studies show that mutations in DNAJC12, a co-chaperone for monoamine synthesis may cause mild hyperphenylalaninemia with infantile dystonia, young-onset parkinsonism, developmental delay and cognitive deficits. To this end, DNAJC12 gene has been included in newborn screening, most revealingly in Spain, and those results are a testament to the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in combating human diseases. However, practitioners may be unaware of these advances and it is probable that many patients, especially adults, have yet to receive molecular testing for DNAJC12. Therefore, this review summarizes genotype-phenotype relationships and treatment paradigms for patients with DNAJC12 mutations. It provides an overview of the structure of DNAJC12 protein, known mutations, domains and binding partners, and elaborates on its role in monoamine synthesis, disease etiology and pathogenesis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dysautonomia has substantially impacted acute COVID-19 severity as well as symptom burden after recovery from COVID-19 (long COVID), yet the underlying causes remain unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in postmortem vagus nerve specimen together with inflammatory cell infiltration derived primarily from monocytes. This is associated with a decreased respiratory rate in non-survivors of critical COVID-19. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces vagus nerve inflammation followed by autonomic dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTo date, it is still controversial whether tau phosphorylation plays a role in Huntingtons disease (HD), as previous studies demonstrated either no alterations or increases in phosphorylated tau (pTau) in HD post-mortem brain and mouse models.

ObjectivesThe goal of this study was to determine whether total tau and pTau levels are altered in HD.

MethodsImmunohistochemistry, cellular fractionations, and western blots were used to measure tau and pTau levels in a large cohort of HD and control post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, western blots were performed to assess tau, and pTau levels in HD and control isogenic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons and neuronal stem cells (NSCs). Similarly, western blots were used to assess tau and pTau in HttQ111 and transgenic R6/2 mice. Lastly, total tau levels were assessed in HD and healthy control plasma using Quanterix Simoa assay.

ResultsOur results revealed that, while there was no difference in tau or pTau levels in HD PFC compared to controls, tau phosphorylated at S396 levels were increased in PFC samples from HD patients 60 years or older at time of death. Additionally, tau and pTau levels were not changed in HD ESC-derived cortical neurons and NSCs. Similarly, tau or pTau levels were not altered in HttQ111 and transgenic R6/2 mice compared to wild-type littermates. Lastly, tau levels were not changed in plasma from a small cohort of HD patients compared to controls.

ConclusionTogether these findings demonstrate that pTau-S396 levels increase significantly with age in HD PFC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with significant environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, influencing its onset and progression. Although previous studies have suggested that certain diets may reduce the incidence of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this randomized crossover study of 20 elderly adults, we investigated the effects of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on the plasma lipidome, analyzing 784 lipid species across 47 classes. We identified substantial changes in response to intervention, notably a global elevation across all plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipid species among others, with many changes linked with changes to clinical and biochemical markers of AD. Leveraging our prior clinical studies on AD (n = 1,912), we found that MMKD was inversely associated with the lipidomic signature of prevalent and incident AD. Given its low risk and cost, MMKD could be a promising approach for prevention or early symptomatic treatment of AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTION: Neuroanatomical normative modelling can capture individual variability in Alzheimers Disease (AD). We used neuroanatomical normative modelling to track individuals disease progression in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD.

METHODS: Cortical thickness and subcortical volume neuroanatomical normative models were generated using healthy controls (n[~]58k). These models were used to calculate regional Z-scores in 4361 T1-weighted MRI time-series scans. Regions with Z-scores &lt;-1.96 were classified as outliers and mapped on the brain, and also summarised by total outlier count (tOC).

RESULTS: Rate of change in tOC increased in AD and in people with MCI who converted to AD and correlated with multiple non-imaging markers. Moreover, a higher annual rate of change in tOC increased the risk of MCI progression to AD. Brain Z-score maps showed that the hippocampus had the highest rate of atrophy change.

CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level atrophy rates can be tracked by using regional outlier maps and tOC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by a highly variable clinical presentation and multifaceted genetic and biological bases that translate into great patient heterogeneity. The identification of homogeneous subgroups of patients in terms of both clinical presentation and biological causes, could favour the development of effective treatments, healthcare, and clinical trials. We aimed to identify and characterise homogenous clinical subgroups of ALS, examining whether they represent underlying biological trends.

MethodsLatent class clustering analysis, an unsupervised machine-learning method, was used to identify homogenous subpopulations in 6,523 people with ALS from Project MinE, using widely collected ALS-related clinical variables. The clusters were validated using 7,829 independent patients from STRENGTH. We tested whether the identified subgroups were associated with biological trends in genetic variation across genes previously linked to ALS, polygenic risk scores of ALS and related neuropsychiatric traits, and in gene expression data from post-mortem motor cortex samples.

ResultsWe identified five ALS subgroups based on patterns in clinical data which were general across international datasets. Distinct genetic trends were observed for rare variants in the SOD1 and C9orf72 genes, and across genes implicated in biological processes relevant to ALS. Polygenic risk scores of ALS, schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease were also higher in distinct clusters with respect to controls. Gene expression analysis identified different altered biological processes across clusters reflecting the genetic differences. We developed a machine learning classifier based on our model to assign subgroup membership using clinical data available at first visit, and made it available on a public webserver at http://latentclusterals.er.kcl.ac.uk.

ConclusionALS subgroups characterised by highly distinct clinical presentations were discovered and validated in two large independent international datasets. Such groups were also characterised by different underlying genetic architectures and biology. Our results showed that data-driven patient stratification into more clinically and biologically homogeneous subtypes of ALS is possible and could help develop more effective and targeted approaches to the biomedical and clinical study of ALS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects nearly one million people in the United States. Up to 50% of patients with MS experience depression.

ObjectiveTo investigate how white matter network disruption is related to depression in MS.

DesignRetrospective case-control study of participants who received research-quality 3-tesla neuroimaging as part of MS clinical care from 2010-2018. Analyses were performed from May 1 to September 30, 2022.

SettingSingle-center academic medical specialty MS clinic.

ParticipantsParticipants with MS were identified via the electronic health record (EHR). All participants were diagnosed by an MS specialist and completed research-quality MRI at 3T. After excluding participants with poor image quality, 783 were included. Inclusion in the depression group (MS&#43;Depression) required either: 1) ICD-10 depression diagnosis (F32-F34.*); 2) prescription of antidepressant medication; or 3) screening positive via Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or -9 (PHQ-9). Age- and sex-matched nondepressed comparators (MS-Depression) included persons with no depression diagnosis, no psychiatric medications, and were asymptomatic on PHQ-2/9.

ExposureDepression diagnosis.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)We first evaluated if lesions were preferentially located within the depression network compared to other brain regions. Next, we examined if MS&#43;Depression patients had greater lesion burden, and if this was driven by lesions specifically in the depression network. Outcome measures were the burden of lesions (e.g., impacted fascicles) within a network and across the brain. Secondary measures included between-diagnosis lesion burden, stratified by brain network. Linear mixed-effects models were employed.

ResultsThree hundred-eighty participants met inclusion criteria, (232 MS&#43;Depression: age[SD]=49[12], %females=86; 148 MS-Depression: age[SD]=47[13], %females=79). MS lesions preferentially affected fascicles within versus outside the depression network ({beta}=0.09, 95% CI=0.08-0.10, P&lt;0.001). MS&#43;Depression had more white matter lesion burden ({beta}=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10, P=0.015); this was driven by lesions within the depression network ({beta}=0.02, 95% CI 0.003-0.040, P=0.020).

Conclusions and RelevanceWe provide new evidence supporting a relationship between white matter lesions and depression in MS. MS lesions disproportionately impacted fascicles in the depression network. MS&#43;Depression had more disease than MS-Depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network. Future studies relating lesion location to personalized depression interventions are warranted.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre white matter lesions that impact fascicles connecting a previously-described depression network associated with depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)?

FindingsIn this retrospective, case-control study of patients with MS including 232 patients with depression and 148 nondepressed MS comparators, patients with MS had more disease within the depression network, irrespective of depression diagnosis. Patients with depression had more disease than those without depression, which was driven by disease within the depression network specifically.

MeaningLesion location and burden may contribute to depression comorbidity in MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent studies show that mutations in DNAJC12, a co-chaperone for monoamine synthesis may cause mild hyperphenylalaninemia with infantile dystonia, young-onset parkinsonism, developmental delay and cognitive deficits. To this end, DNAJC12 gene has been included in newborn screening, most revealingly in Spain, and those results are a testament to the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in combating human diseases. However, practitioners may be unaware of these advances and it is probable that many patients, especially adults, have yet to receive molecular testing for DNAJC12. Therefore, this review summarizes genotype-phenotype relationships and treatment paradigms for patients with DNAJC12 mutations. It provides an overview of the structure of DNAJC12 protein, known mutations, domains and binding partners, and elaborates on its role in monoamine synthesis, disease etiology and pathogenesis.</p>
