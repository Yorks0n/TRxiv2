Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision-making included patients' history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4 recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.\nProbing a neural unreliability account of auditory sensory processing atypicalities in Rett Syndrome.\nAuthors: Brima, T.; Beker, S.; Prinsloo, K. D.; Butler, J. S.; Djukic, A.; Freedman, E. G.; Molholm, S.; Foxe, J. J.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301723\nBackground: In the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. Methods: AEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. Results: Substantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. Conclusions: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.\nDon't put words in my mouth: Speech perception can generate False Positive activation of a speech BCI\nAuthors: Schippers, A.; Vansteensel, M. J.; Freudenburg, Z. V.; Ramsey, N. F.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.23300437\nRecent studies have demonstrated that speech can be decoded from brain activity and used for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based communication. It is however also known that the area often used as a signal source for speech decoding BCIs, the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), is also engaged when people perceive speech, thus making speech perception a potential source of false positive activation of the BCI. The current study investigated if and how speech perception may interfere with reliable speech BCI control. We recorded high-density electrocorticography (HD-ECoG) data from five subjects while they performed a speech perception and speech production task and trained a support-vector machine (SVM) on the produced speech data. Our results show that decoders that are highly reliable at detecting self-produced speech from brain signals also generate false positives during the perception of speech. We conclude that speech perception interferes with reliable BCI control, and that efforts to limit the occurrence of false positives during daily-life BCI use should be implemented in BCI design to increase the likelihood of successful adaptation by end users.\nIndividual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Arnold, M.; Buyukozkan, M.; Doraiswamy, P. M.; Nho, K.; Wu, T.; Gudnason, V.; Launer, L. J.; Wang-Sattler, R.; Adamski, J.; The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ; Alzheimer's Disease Metabolomics Consortium, ; De Jager, P. L.; Ertekin-Taner, N.; Bennett, D. A.; Saykin, A. J.; Peters, A.; Suhre, K.; Kaddurah-Daouk, R.; Kastenmüller, G.; Krumsiek, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.23297820\nImpaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimers disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic bioenergetic capacity as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.\nCirculating Blood circular RNA in Parkinson Disease; a systematic study\nAuthors: Beric, A.; Sun, Y.; Sanchez, S.; Martin, C.; Powell, T.; Pardo, J. A.; Sanford, J.; Botia, J. A.; Cruchaga, C.; Ibanez, L.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301623\nWe aimed to identify circRNAs associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) by leveraging 1,848 participants and 1,789 circRNA from two of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood transcriptomic data. To comprehensively understand changes in circRNAs we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant, and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were consistent in the mixed models, mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. Finally, we included the 149 circRNA in a model with a ROC AUC of 0.825, showing that have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Overall, we demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be leveraged as biomarkers.\nPeripheral innate immunophenotype in neurodegenerative disease: blood-based profiles and links to survival\nAuthors: Strauss, A.; Swann, P.; Kigar, S.; Christou, R.; Yarkoni, N. S.; Murley, A. G.; Chouliaras, L.; Savulich, G.; Bevan-Jones, R.; Surendranathan, A.; O'Brien, J.; Rowe, J.; Malpetti, M.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301348\nThe innate immune system plays an integral role in the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to central innate immune cells (e.g. cerebral microglia), peripheral innate immune cells (e.g. blood monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells) may also differ in these conditions. However, the characterization of peripheral innate immune cell types across different neurodegenerative diseases remains incomplete. This study aimed to characterize peripheral innate immune profiles using flow cytometry for immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in n=148 people with Alzheimers disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Corticobasal syndrome (CBS), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Lewy Body Disease (LBD) as compared to n=37 healthy controls. To compare groups, we used Principal Component Analysis and multivariate Dissimilarity analysis across 19 innate immune cell types. We identified pro-inflammatory profiles that significantly differ between patients with all-cause dementia and healthy controls, with some significant differences between groups. Regression analysis confirmed that time to death following the blood test correlated with the individuals immune profile weighting, positively to TREM2+ and nonclassical monocytes and negatively to classical monocytes. Taken together, these results describe transdiagnostic peripheral immune profiles and highlight the link between prognosis and the monocyte cellular subdivision and function (as measured by surface protein expression). The results suggest that blood-derived innate immune profiles can inform sub-populations of cells relevant for specific neurodegenerative diseases that are significantly linked to accelerated disease progression and worse survival outcomes across diagnoses. Blood-based innate immune profiles may contribute to enhanced precision medicine approaches dementia, helping to identify and monitor therapeutic targets and stratify patients for candidate immunotherapies.\nClinical value of plasma ALZpath pTau217 immunoassay in the assessment of mild cognitive impairment\nAuthors: Lehmann, S.; Schraen-Maschke, S.; Buee, L.; Vidal, J.-S.; Delaby, C.; Blanc, F.; Paquet, C.; Allinquant, B.; Bombois, S.; Gabelle, A.; Hanon, O.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301570\nObjectivesWe sought to compare two of the most promising plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer disease: pTau181 and pTau217. MethodspTau181 and pTau217 were quantified using SIMOA Quanterix and ALZpath assays in the well characterized prospective multicentre BALTAZAR cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants. ResultsAmong MCI participants, 55% were A{beta}+ and 29% developed dementia due to AD. pTau181 and pTau217 were higher in the A{beta}+ population with fold-change of 1.5 and 2.7 respectively. Concentration were also higher in MCI that converted to AD versus with hazard ratio of 1.38 (1.26-1.51) for pTau181 compared to 8.22 (5.45-12.39) for pTau217. The AUC for predicting A{beta}+ was 0.783 (95%CI: 0.721-0.836; cut-point 2.75 pg/mL) for pTau181 and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.868-0.948; cut-point 0.44 pg/mL) for pTau217. The predictive power of pTau217 was not improved by adding age, sex, and APOE{varepsilon}4 status in a logistic model. The confounding factors of age, APOE{varepsilon}4 or renal dysfunction were associated with both pTau levels, but pTau217 clinical performance was only marginally modified by these comorbidities. Using a two cut-point approach, a 95% positive predictive value for A{beta}+ corresponded to pTau217 \u003e 0.8 ng/mL and a 95% negative predictive value at \u003c0.23 ng/mL. At these two cut-points, the percentages of MCI conversion were 56.8% and 9.7% respectively, while the annual rates of decline in MMSE were -2.32 versus -0.65. ConclusionsPlasma pTau217 and pTau181 both correlate with AD, but the fold-change in pTau217 make it better to diagnose cerebral amyloidosis, and predict cognitive decline and conversion to AD dementia.\nA pathogenic variant in RAB32 causes autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease and activates LRRK2 kinase\nAuthors: Gustavsson, E.

J.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24300927\nBackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD. MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed. FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C\u003eG (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase. InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.

The need for ecological validity of the existing diagnostic tools motivates research on biomarkers, such as stimulus-evoked brain responses. With the aim of enhancing the physiological interpretation of the latter, we used EEG to investigate how functional brain network patterns associated with the neural response to natural speech are affected in persons with post-stroke chronic aphasia. EEG was recorded from 24 healthy controls and 40 persons with aphasia while they listened to a story. Stimulus-evoked brain responses at all scalp regions were measured as neural envelope tracking in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and low-gamma bands (30-49 Hz) using mutual information. Functional connectivity between neural-tracking signals was measured, and the Network-Based Statistics toolbox was used to: 1) assess the added value of the neural tracking vs EEG time series, 2) test between-group differences and 3) investigate any association with language performance in aphasia. Graph theory was also used to investigate topological alterations in aphasia. Functional connectivity was higher when assessed from neural tracking compared to EEG time series. Persons with aphasia showed weaker low-gamma-band left-hemispheric connectivity, and graph theory-based results showed a greater network segregation and higher region-specific node strength. Aphasia also exhibited a correlation between delta-band connectivity within the left pre-frontal region and language performance. We demonstrated the added value of neural tracking when investigating functional brain networks associated with natural speech processing in post-stroke aphasia. Its higher sensitivity to language-related brain circuits favours its use as informative biomarker for the assessment of aphasia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cerebrovascular diseases are the second most common cause of death worldwide and one of the major causes of disability burden. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as ischemic stroke management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 in providing clinical decision support for emergency room neurologists by comparing its recommendations with expert opinions and real-world treatment outcomes. A cohort of 100 consecutive patients with acute stroke symptoms was retrospectively reviewed. The data used for decision-making included patients&#39; history, clinical evaluation, imaging studies results, and other relevant details. Each case was independently presented to GPT-4, which provided a scaled recommendation (1-7) regarding the appropriateness of treatment, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the need for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Additionally, GPT-4 estimated the 90-day mortality probability for each patient and elucidated its reasoning for each recommendation. The recommendations were then compared with those of a stroke specialist and actual treatment decision. The agreement of GPT-4 recommendations with the expert opinion yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.93], and with real-world treatment decisions, an AUC of 0.80 [0.69-0.91]. In terms of mortality prediction, out of 13 patients who died within 90 days, GPT-4 accurately identified 10 within its top 25 high-risk predictions (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.8077-0.9739]; HR: 6.98 [95% CI: 2.88-16.9]), surpassing supervised machine-learning models. This study demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 as a viable clinical decision support tool in the management of ischemic stroke. Its ability to provide explainable recommendations without requiring structured data input aligns well with the routine workflows of treating physicians. Future studies should focus on prospective validations and exploring the integration of such AI tools into clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: In the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is &#34;stationarity&#34; of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. Methods: AEPs were recorded to simple 100Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. Results: Substantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a &#34;neural unreliability&#34; account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. Conclusions: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent studies have demonstrated that speech can be decoded from brain activity and used for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based communication. It is however also known that the area often used as a signal source for speech decoding BCIs, the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), is also engaged when people perceive speech, thus making speech perception a potential source of false positive activation of the BCI. The current study investigated if and how speech perception may interfere with reliable speech BCI control. We recorded high-density electrocorticography (HD-ECoG) data from five subjects while they performed a speech perception and speech production task and trained a support-vector machine (SVM) on the produced speech data. Our results show that decoders that are highly reliable at detecting self-produced speech from brain signals also generate false positives during the perception of speech. We conclude that speech perception interferes with reliable BCI control, and that efforts to limit the occurrence of false positives during daily-life BCI use should be implemented in BCI design to increase the likelihood of successful adaptation by end users.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimers disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic  bioenergetic capacity as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We aimed to identify circRNAs associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) by leveraging 1,848 participants and 1,789 circRNA from two of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood transcriptomic data. To comprehensively understand changes in circRNAs we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant, and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were consistent in the mixed models, mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. Finally, we included the 149 circRNA in a model with a ROC AUC of 0.825, showing that have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Overall, we demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be leveraged as biomarkers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The innate immune system plays an integral role in the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to central innate immune cells (e.g. cerebral microglia), peripheral innate immune cells (e.g. blood monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells) may also differ in these conditions. However, the characterization of peripheral innate immune cell types across different neurodegenerative diseases remains incomplete. This study aimed to characterize peripheral innate immune profiles using flow cytometry for immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in n=148 people with Alzheimers disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Corticobasal syndrome (CBS), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Lewy Body Disease (LBD) as compared to n=37 healthy controls. To compare groups, we used Principal Component Analysis and multivariate Dissimilarity analysis across 19 innate immune cell types. We identified pro-inflammatory profiles that significantly differ between patients with all-cause dementia and healthy controls, with some significant differences between groups. Regression analysis confirmed that time to death following the blood test correlated with the individuals immune profile weighting, positively to TREM2&#43; and nonclassical monocytes and negatively to classical monocytes. Taken together, these results describe transdiagnostic peripheral immune profiles and highlight the link between prognosis and the monocyte cellular subdivision and function (as measured by surface protein expression). The results suggest that blood-derived innate immune profiles can inform sub-populations of cells relevant for specific neurodegenerative diseases that are significantly linked to accelerated disease progression and worse survival outcomes across diagnoses. Blood-based innate immune profiles may contribute to enhanced precision medicine approaches dementia, helping to identify and monitor therapeutic targets and stratify patients for candidate immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesWe sought to compare two of the most promising plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer disease: pTau181 and pTau217.

MethodspTau181 and pTau217 were quantified using SIMOA Quanterix and ALZpath assays in the well characterized prospective multicentre BALTAZAR cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants.

ResultsAmong MCI participants, 55% were A{beta}&#43; and 29% developed dementia due to AD. pTau181 and pTau217 were higher in the A{beta}&#43; population with fold-change of 1.5 and 2.7 respectively. Concentration were also higher in MCI that converted to AD versus with hazard ratio of 1.38 (1.26-1.51) for pTau181 compared to 8.22 (5.45-12.39) for pTau217. The AUC for predicting A{beta}&#43; was 0.783 (95%CI: 0.721-0.836; cut-point 2.75 pg/mL) for pTau181 and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.868-0.948; cut-point 0.44 pg/mL) for pTau217. The predictive power of pTau217 was not improved by adding age, sex, and APOE{varepsilon}4 status in a logistic model. The confounding factors of age, APOE{varepsilon}4 or renal dysfunction were associated with both pTau levels, but pTau217 clinical performance was only marginally modified by these comorbidities. Using a two cut-point approach, a 95% positive predictive value for A{beta}&#43; corresponded to pTau217 &gt; 0.8 ng/mL and a 95% negative predictive value at &lt;0.23 ng/mL. At these two cut-points, the percentages of MCI conversion were 56.8% and 9.7% respectively, while the annual rates of decline in MMSE were -2.32 versus -0.65.

ConclusionsPlasma pTau217 and pTau181 both correlate with AD, but the fold-change in pTau217 make it better to diagnose cerebral amyloidosis, and predict cognitive decline and conversion to AD dementia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD.

MethodsAffected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed.

FindingsWe found RAB32 c.213C&gt;G (Ser71Arg) to co-segregate with autosomal dominant parkinsonism in three multi-incident families. RAB32 Ser71Arg was also significantly associated with PD in case-control samples: genotyping and database searches identified thirteen more patients with the same variant that was absent in unaffected controls. Notably, RAB32 Ser71Arg heterozygotes share a common haplotype. At autopsy, one patient had sparse neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the midbrain and thalamus, without Lewy body pathology. In transfected cells the RAB32 Arg71 was twice as potent as Ser71 wild type to activate LRRK2 kinase.

InterpretationOur study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.

        <p class="abstract">One out of three stroke-patients develop language processing impairment known as aphasia. The need for ecological validity of the existing diagnostic tools motivates research on biomarkers, such as stimulus-evoked brain responses. With the aim of enhancing the physiological interpretation of the latter, we used EEG to investigate how functional brain network patterns associated with the neural response to natural speech are affected in persons with post-stroke chronic aphasia.

EEG was recorded from 24 healthy controls and 40 persons with aphasia while they listened to a story. Stimulus-evoked brain responses at all scalp regions were measured as neural envelope tracking in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and low-gamma bands (30-49 Hz) using mutual information. Functional connectivity between neural-tracking signals was measured, and the Network-Based Statistics toolbox was used to: 1) assess the added value of the neural tracking vs EEG time series, 2) test between-group differences and 3) investigate any association with language performance in aphasia. Graph theory was also used to investigate topological alterations in aphasia.

Functional connectivity was higher when assessed from neural tracking compared to EEG time series. Persons with aphasia showed weaker low-gamma-band left-hemispheric connectivity, and graph theory-based results showed a greater network segregation and higher region-specific node strength. Aphasia also exhibited a correlation between delta-band connectivity within the left pre-frontal region and language performance.

We demonstrated the added value of neural tracking when investigating functional brain networks associated with natural speech processing in post-stroke aphasia. Its higher sensitivity to language-related brain circuits favours its use as informative biomarker for the assessment of aphasia.</p>
