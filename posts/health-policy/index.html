This study aims to examine the factors influencing the trajectory of COVID-19 evolution in Asia, to provide insights for optimizing public health policies. MethodsIn this longitudinal analysis, we combined COVID-19 cases and vaccination percentages from Our Word in Data with the policy stringency index from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for 12 Asian countries between January 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was conducted to identify countries with similar COVID-19 evolution trajectories. We also investigated the potential impact of seasonal variations on the virus trajectory. The relationship between the level of policy response, vaccination coverage, and COVID-19 cases was explored using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). FindingsThere were noticeable differences in the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 among the countries. The 12 Asian countries were grouped into two clusters based on evolutionary similarities. Cluster 1 consisted of West Asian countries (Azerbaijan, Turkey, Bahrain, Israel and Lebanon); while Cluster 2 included Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The analysis revealed that the stringency index and vaccination coverage were associated with a statistically significant impact (both P values \u003c 0{middle dot}0001) on the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 (adjR2=0{middle dot}54). The dose-response relationships demonstrated that the continuous high levels of stringency index ([\u0026ge;]87{middle dot}6) or vaccination coverage ([\u0026ge;] 42{middle dot}0%) have led to a decrease in COVID-19 infection rates. In early 2021, the adjR2 increased to 0{middle dot}93 for all countries. Furthermore, the adjR2 for Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 were 0{middle dot}86 and 0{middle dot}90 respectively. All GAMs models have significantly improved compared to null model (P values \u003c0{middle dot}0001). InterpretationBy strengthening vaccination ahead of susceptible seasons and enhancing personal self-protection measures, the transmission of COVID-19 among the population can be reduced even during the highly infectious Omicron era.

This study aimed to describe trends in disposable e-cigarette use among adults in Great Britain since 2021 and establish who would currently be affected by a ban on disposables. Study designNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey. MethodsWe analysed data from 69,973 adults surveyed between January-2021 and August-2023. We estimated monthly time trends in the weighted prevalence of current disposable e-cigarette use among adults and by sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. ResultsFrom January-2021 to August-2023, the prevalence of disposable e-cigarette use grew from 0.1% to 4.9%. This rise was observed across all population subgroups but was most pronounced among younger adults (e.g., reaching 15.9% of 18-year-olds compared with 1.3% of 65-year-olds), those who currently smoke (16.3%), and those who stopped smoking in the past year (18.2%). Use among never smokers remained relatively rare (1.5%), except among 18-24-year-olds (7.1%). Use was significantly higher in England than Wales or Scotland (5.3% vs. 2.0% and 2.8%) and among less (vs. more) advantaged social grades (6.1% vs. 4.0%), those with (vs. without) children (6.4% vs. 4.4%), and those with (vs. without) a history of mental health conditions (9.3% vs. 3.1%). ConclusionsA ban on disposable e-cigarettes would currently affect one in 20 adults in Great Britain (approximately 2.6 million people). The impact would be greatest on young people, including the 316,000 18-24 year-olds who currently use disposables but who have never regularly smoked tobacco, which may discourage uptake of vaping in this group. However, a ban would also affect 1.1 million people who currently smoke and a further 744,000 who previously smoked. It would also have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged groups that have higher rates of smoking and typically find it harder to quit.\n",
