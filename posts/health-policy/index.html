The persistence of measles in many regions demonstrates large immunity gaps, resulting from incomplete or ineffective immunization with measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). A key factor affecting MCV impact is age, with infants receiving dose 1 (MCV1) at older ages having a reduced risk of vaccine failure, but also an increased risk of contracting infection before vaccination.">

A.; Briga, M.; Domenech de Celles, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298759\nThe persistence of measles in many regions demonstrates large immunity gaps, resulting from incomplete or ineffective immunization with measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). A key factor affecting MCV impact is age, with infants receiving dose 1 (MCV1) at older ages having a reduced risk of vaccine failure, but also an increased risk of contracting infection before vaccination. Here, we designed a new method--based on a transmission model incorporating realistic vaccination delays and age variations in MCV1 effectiveness--to capture this risk trade-off and estimate the optimal age for recommending MCV1. We predict a large heterogeneity in the optimal ages (range: 6-20 months), contrasting the homogeneity of observed recommendations worldwide. Furthermore, we show that the optimal age depends on the local epidemiology of measles, with a lower optimal age predicted in populations suffering higher transmission. Overall, our results suggest the scope for public health authorities to tailor the recommended schedule for better measles control.\nA rapid review exploring the effectiveness of artificial intelligence for cancer diagnosis\nAuthors: Wale, A.; Shaw, H.; Ayres, T.; Okolie, C.; Morgan, H.; Everitt, J.; Little, K.; Edwards, R. T.; Davies, J.; Lewis, R.; Cooper, A.; Edwards, A. G.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.23298257\nThere is growing demand for diagnostic services in the UK. This rapid review aimed to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic radiology with a focus on cancer diagnosis. A range of AI models including machine learning, deep learning and ensemble models, were assessed in this review. The review included an initial broad mapping exercise and a more in-depth synthesis of a specific sub-set of the evidence. The review included evidence available from 2018 until June 2023. A total of 92 comparative primary studies were included in the evidence map. The evidence map identified 52 studies in which the AI models were in the early stages of development and validation, and highlighted breast, lung and prostate cancers as the type of cancers most frequently reported on. 28 studies evaluating an established model and focusing on the diagnosis of breast, lung, and prostate cancer were included in the in-depth synthesis. All studies included in the in-depth synthesis were classified as diagnostic accuracy studies. Only one study evaluated an AI model that was commercially available in the UK. Most studies reported results in favour of the AI models, however, these improvements were not always statistically significant. The studies also varied considerably in terms of AI models studied, type of cancer, images used, and comparison made; and were limited in terms of their methodology. When used as a standalone diagnostic tool, there is evidence to suggest that AI can improve diagnostic accuracy or is comparable to experienced radiologists, however this may be dependent on the AI model being used. There is evidence to suggest that AI may be beneficial when used as a support tool for clinicians/radiologists with less experience. The impact of AI on the timeline involved in diagnosis appeared inconsistent. AI may speed up the diagnostic timeline when the level of cancer suspicion is low but may increase diagnostic timelines when the level of cancer suspicion is high. The evidence suggests that clinicians are accepting of AI-based assistance for cancer diagnosis. Policy and practice implicationsThe overall evidence for effectiveness appeared in favour of AI and several factors were identified that impact the effectiveness of the AI models. AI may improve diagnostic accuracy in clinicians/radiologists with less experience of interpreting radiological images. However, further well-designed high-quality research is needed from the UK and similar countries to better understand the effectiveness of AI in cancer diagnosis. Economic considerationsThere is little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of using AI for cancer diagnosis. In theory, it might be possible for AI to assist with earlier diagnosis of cancer with both health and economic benefits. Funding statementThe Public Health Wales Observatory was funded for this work by the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, itself funded by Health and Care Research Wales on behalf of Welsh Government. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is a Rapid Review?C_ST_ABSOur rapid reviews (RR) use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias. Who is this Rapid Review for?The review question was suggested by the Health Sciences Directorate (Policy). Background / Aim of Rapid ReviewThere is growing demand for diagnostic services in the UK. The use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis is part of the Welsh Governments programme for transforming and modernising planned care and reducing waiting lists in Wales. This rapid review aimed to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic radiology with a focus on cancer diagnosis. A range of AI models including machine learning, deep learning and ensemble models, were assessed in this review. The term AI models was therefore used to encompass these different types of AI models described in the literature. The review included an initial broad mapping exercise and a more in-depth synthesis of a specific sub-set of the evidence. The focus of the in-depth synthesis was informed by the reviews stakeholders based on the findings of the mapping exercise.

C_LIO_LIThere is little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of using AI for cancer diagnosis. One modelling paper from the United States (US) suggests using AI in lung cancer screening using low-dose computerised tomography (CT) scans can be cost-effective, up to a cost of $1,240 per patient screened. C_LIO_LIThe UK (and its constituent countries) perform consistently poorly against European and international comparators in terms of cancer survival rates. Cancer screening was suspended and routine diagnostic work deferred in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. C_LIO_LIThe cost of cancer to the UK economy in 2019 was estimated to be least {pound}1.4 billion a year in lost wages and benefits alone. When widening the perspective to include mortality, this figure rises to {pound}7.6 billion a year. Pro-rating both figures to the Welsh economy and adjusting for inflation gives figures of {pound}79 million and {pound}429 million per annum respectively C_LI\nParticipant perceptions of disability training for health workers: a qualitative study in Ghana\nAuthors: Rotenberg, S.; Ryan, S.; Ziebland, S.; Ganle, J. K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.23299018\nIntroduction: Disabled people often report poor treatment by health workers, and health workers often report wanting more training about how to care for disabled people. However, existing disability training for health workers is usually delivered in one-off interventions, with little follow-up, evaluation, and focus on long-term learning. This insufficiency makes it important to understand how disability training for health workers can be more effective. Therefore, we interviewed stakeholders involved in an existing disability training intervention in Ghana to understand how disability training for health workers could be improved. Methods: In-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 people involved in disability training (either as trainers or trainees) in Ghana. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants spoke about the challenges with existing training, namely how the current approach was insufficient, the consequences of informality in running training and the need for more sign language instruction. Several participants suggested improvements for training, including having external motivation (i.e., professional development credits, monetary benefits, etc.), more collaborative initiatives across institutions and government, and curriculum integration. We developed a theory of change model to show how different components of disability training support learning. Discussion: These results show that disability training for health workers is important and that there is scope to refine and standardize training. In particular, the findings demonstrate how future initiatives to train health workers can be developed and implemented. They also emphasize the need to solicit perspectives from individuals who have experienced training in order to improve future iterations.\n",

A key factor affecting MCV impact is age, with infants receiving dose 1 (MCV1) at older ages having a reduced risk of vaccine failure, but also an increased risk of contracting infection before vaccination. Here, we designed a new method--based on a transmission model incorporating realistic vaccination delays and age variations in MCV1 effectiveness--to capture this risk trade-off and estimate the optimal age for recommending MCV1. We predict a large heterogeneity in the optimal ages (range: 6-20 months), contrasting the homogeneity of observed recommendations worldwide.

        <p class="abstract">There is growing demand for diagnostic services in the UK. This rapid review aimed to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic radiology with a focus on cancer diagnosis. A range of AI models including machine learning, deep learning and ensemble models, were assessed in this review.

The review included an initial broad mapping exercise and a more in-depth synthesis of a specific sub-set of the evidence. The review included evidence available from 2018 until June 2023.

A total of 92 comparative primary studies were included in the evidence map. The evidence map identified 52 studies in which the AI models were in the early stages of development and validation, and highlighted breast, lung and prostate cancers as the type of cancers most frequently reported on. 28 studies evaluating an established model and focusing on the diagnosis of breast, lung, and prostate cancer were included in the in-depth synthesis. All studies included in the in-depth synthesis were classified as diagnostic accuracy studies. Only one study evaluated an AI model that was commercially available in the UK.

Most studies reported results in favour of the AI models, however, these improvements were not always statistically significant. The studies also varied considerably in terms of AI models studied, type of cancer, images used, and comparison made; and were limited in terms of their methodology. When used as a standalone diagnostic tool, there is evidence to suggest that AI can improve diagnostic accuracy or is comparable to experienced radiologists, however this may be dependent on the AI model being used. There is evidence to suggest that AI may be beneficial when used as a support tool for clinicians/radiologists with less experience. The impact of AI on the timeline involved in diagnosis appeared inconsistent. AI may speed up the diagnostic timeline when the level of cancer suspicion is low but may increase diagnostic timelines when the level of cancer suspicion is high. The evidence suggests that clinicians are accepting of AI-based assistance for cancer diagnosis.

Policy and practice implicationsThe overall evidence for effectiveness appeared in favour of AI and several factors were identified that impact the effectiveness of the AI models. AI may improve diagnostic accuracy in clinicians/radiologists with less experience of interpreting radiological images. However, further well-designed high-quality research is needed from the UK and similar countries to better understand the effectiveness of AI in cancer diagnosis.

Economic considerationsThere is little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of using AI for cancer diagnosis. In theory, it might be possible for AI to assist with earlier diagnosis of cancer with both health and economic benefits.

Funding statementThe Public Health Wales Observatory was funded for this work by the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, itself funded by Health and Care Research Wales on behalf of Welsh Government.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is a Rapid Review?C_ST_ABSOur rapid reviews (RR) use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias.

Who is this Rapid Review for?The review question was suggested by the Health Sciences Directorate (Policy).

Background / Aim of Rapid ReviewThere is growing demand for diagnostic services in the UK. The use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis is part of the Welsh Governments programme for transforming and modernising planned care and reducing waiting lists in Wales. This rapid review aimed to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic radiology with a focus on cancer diagnosis. A range of AI models including machine learning, deep learning and ensemble models, were assessed in this review. The term  AI models was therefore used to encompass these different types of AI models described in the literature. The review included an initial broad mapping exercise and a more in-depth synthesis of a specific sub-set of the evidence. The focus of the in-depth synthesis was informed by the reviews stakeholders based on the findings of the mapping exercise.

Economic considerationsO_LIIn theory it might be possible for AI to assist with earlier diagnosis of cancer with both health and economic benefits.
C_LIO_LIThere is little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of using AI for cancer diagnosis. One modelling paper from the United States (US) suggests using AI in lung cancer screening using low-dose computerised tomography (CT) scans can be cost-effective, up to a cost of $1,240 per patient screened.
C_LIO_LIThe UK (and its constituent countries) perform consistently poorly against European and international comparators in terms of cancer survival rates. Cancer screening was suspended and routine diagnostic work deferred in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.
C_LIO_LIThe cost of cancer to the UK economy in 2019 was estimated to be least {pound}1.4 billion a year in lost wages and benefits alone. When widening the perspective to include mortality, this figure rises to {pound}7.6 billion a year. Pro-rating both figures to the Welsh economy and adjusting for inflation gives figures of {pound}79 million and {pound}429 million per annum respectively

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Disabled people often report poor treatment by health workers, and health workers often report wanting more training about how to care for disabled people. However, existing disability training for health workers is usually delivered in one-off interventions, with little follow-up, evaluation, and focus on long-term learning. This insufficiency makes it important to understand how disability training for health workers can be more effective. Therefore, we interviewed stakeholders involved in an existing disability training intervention in Ghana to understand how disability training for health workers could be improved. Methods: In-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 people involved in disability training (either as trainers or trainees) in Ghana. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants spoke about the challenges with existing training, namely how the current approach was insufficient, the consequences of informality in running training and the need for more sign language instruction. Several participants suggested improvements for training, including having external motivation (i.e., professional development credits, monetary benefits, etc.), more collaborative initiatives across institutions and government, and curriculum integration. We developed a theory of change model to show how different components of disability training support learning. Discussion: These results show that disability training for health workers is important and that there is scope to refine and standardize training. In particular, the findings demonstrate how future initiatives to train health workers can be developed and implemented. They also emphasize the need to solicit perspectives from individuals who have experienced training in order to improve future iterations.</p>
