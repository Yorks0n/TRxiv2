Our study aimed to understand the determinants of global political priority for STIs since the 1980s and to discern implications for future prioritisation. MethodsThrough semi-structured interviews from July 2021 to February 2022, we engaged 20 key stakeholders (8 women, 12 men) from academia, United Nations agencies, international non-governmental organisations, philanthropic organisations, and national public health agencies. A published policy framework was employed for thematic analysis, and findings triangulated with relevant literature and policy documents. We examined issue characteristics, prevailing ideas, actor power dynamics and political contexts. ResultsA contrast in perspectives before and after the year 2000 emerged. STI control was high on the global health agenda during the late 1980s and 1990s, as a means to control HIV. A strong policy community agreed on evidence about the high burden of STIs and that STI management could reduce the incidence of HIV. The level of importance decreased when further research evidence did not find an impact of STI control interventions on HIV incidence. Since 2000, cohesion in the STI community has decreased. New framing for broad STI control has not emerged. Interventions that have been funded, such as human papillomavirus vaccination and congenital syphilis elimination have been framed as cancer control or improving newborn survival, rather than as STI control. ConclusionGlobally, the perceived decline in STI control priority might stem from discrepancies between investment choices and experts views on STI priorities. Addressing STIs requires understanding the intertwined nature of politics and empirical evidence in resource allocation. The ascent of universal health coverage presents an opportunity for integrated STI strategies but high-quality care sustainable funding and strategic coordination are essential.

What this study adds?{blacksquare} A range of factors, including but not limited to, empirical evidence of disease burden, have driven the attention paid to STI control over time. {blacksquare}The STI community has lacked cohesion, champions and engagement with civil society, thus contributing to their lowered position on health policy agendas. {blacksquare}STI control has been successful when framed as reaching aligned goals in other areas - HIV control, maternal and child health, cancer control - or when a biomedical intervention (vaccine, diagnostic) is available.

It additionally aimed to discern stakeholders' viewpoints concerning RWD and RWE in HTA and illuminate the obstacles, difficulties, prospects, and consequences associated with the incorporation of RWD and RWE into the realm of HTA. Methods: A comprehensive PRISMA-based systematic review was performed in July 2022 in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, IDEAS-RePEc, International HTA database, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination with ad-hoc supplementary search in Google Scholar and international organization websites. The review included pre-determined inclusion criteria while the selection of eligible studies, the data extraction process and quality assessment were carried out using standardized and transparent methods. Results: Twenty-nine (n=29) studies were included in the review out of 2.115 studies identified by the search strategy. In various global contexts, disparities in RWD utilization were evident, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) serving as the primary evidence source. RWD and RWE played pivotal roles, surpassing relative effectiveness assessments (REAs) and significantly influencing decision-making and cost-effectiveness analyses. Identified challenges impeding RWD integration into HTA encompassed limited local data access, complexities in non-randomized trial design, data quality, privacy, and fragmentation. Addressing these is imperative for optimal RWD utilization. Incorporating RWD/RWE in HTA yields multifaceted advantages, enhancing understanding of treatment efficacy, resource utilization, and cost analysis, particularly via patient registries. RWE complements assessments of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) and rare diseases. Local data utilization strengthens HTA, bridging gaps when RCT data is lacking. RWD aids medical device decision-making, cancer drug reassessment, and indirect treatment comparisons. Challenges include data availability, stakeholder acceptance, expertise, and privacy. However, standardization, training, collaboration, and guidance can surmount these barriers, fostering enhanced RWD utilization in HTA. Conclusions: RWD and RWE are recognized as valuable when RCTs are lacking. Acceptance and use of RWD/RWE vary, with challenges including limited availability, methodological issues, expertise gaps, fragmentation, and data quality concerns. Addressing these barriers is crucial for effective utilization in HTA.\n",

RWD aids medical device decision-making, cancer drug reassessment, and indirect treatment comparisons. Challenges include data availability, stakeholder acceptance, expertise, and privacy. However, standardization, training, collaboration, and guidance can surmount these barriers, fostering enhanced RWD utilization in HTA.   Conclusions: RWD and RWE are recognized as valuable when RCTs are lacking. Acceptance and use of RWD/RWE vary, with challenges including limited availability, methodological issues, expertise gaps, fragmentation, and data quality concerns. Addressing these barriers is crucial for effective utilization in HTA.</p>
