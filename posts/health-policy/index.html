ObjectiveTo describe and evaluate the nature and methodology of the reports and appropriateness of conclusions in MMWR pertaining to masks. Design, Setting and ParticipantsRetrospective cross-sectional study of MMWR publications pertaining to masks from 1978 to 2023. Main outcome measuresStudy date, design, disease focus, setting, population and location. Whether the study was able to assess mask effectiveness, if results were statistically significant, if masks were concluded to be effective, if randomized evidence and/or conflicting data was mentioned or cited, if causal statements were made about effectiveness, and, if so, whether they were appropriate. Results77 studies, all published after 2019, met our inclusion criteria. 75/77 (97.4%) studies were from the United States alone. All geographic regions and age groups were represented. The most common study design was observational without a comparator group 22/77 (28.6%). The most common setting was the community (35/77;45.5%). 0/77 were randomized studies. 23/77 (29.9%) assessed mask effectiveness, with 11/77 (14.3%) being statistically significant, but 58/77 (75.3%) stated masks were effective. Of these, 41/58 (70.7%) used causal language. Only one mannequin study used causal language appropriately (1.3%). 72/77 (93.5%) pertained to SARS-CoV-2 alone. None cited randomized data. 1/77 (1.3%) cited conflicting evidence. Conclusions and RelevanceMMWR publications pertaining to masks drew positive conclusions about mask effectiveness over 75% of the time despite only 30% testing masks and \u003c15% having statistically significant results. No studies were randomized, yet over half drew causal conclusions. The level of evidence generated was low and the conclusions drawn were most often unsupported by the data. Our findings raise concern about the reliability of the journal for informing health policy.\nChanges in Masking Policies in US Healthcare Facilities in the First Quarter of 2023: Do COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations, or Local Political Preferences Predict Loosening Restrictions?\nAuthors: Miller, S. L.; Prasad, V.\nScore: 299.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.23292518\nIntroductionIn the first half of 2023, many US healthcare facilities updated their policies on the required use of face masks by patients and employees. Despite statewide lifts of mask mandates in healthcare settings, the decisions by individual healthcare facilities have remained controversial and inconsistent. We sought to understand these decisions by examining COVID-19 case rates, hospitalization rates, and political affiliation, among counties where hospitals reported updated masking policies in news or social media posts. MethodsWe searched Twitter, Facebook, and Google for news stories related to changes in US healthcare facility masking policies between February 1st and April 30th, 2023. We extracted county-level COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations using data from the CDC and political affiliation was measured using the 2020 presidential election results. We performed logistic regression using COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and political affiliation as predictors and a complete lifting of masking requirements as the outcome. ResultsWe found that the odds of lifting the mask requirement was not associated with COVID-19 cases (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 - 1.02, p-value = 0.54), or hospitalizations (OR 1.06 95% CI 0.88-1.27, p-value = 0.33). We found that for every 10% increase in Republican votes in the 2020 presidential election, there was a 1.33 (95% CI 1.07 - 1.64, p-value = 0.01) increase in odds of having lifted masking requirements completely. DiscussionWe found that the odds of lifting the face mask requirement in healthcare facilities was not associated with COVID-19 cases or hospitalizations but was associated with county-level political affiliation. Our results raise the concern that public health measures may be increasingly seen as political gestures or a response to local political factors.\nThe physical and mental health benefits of touch interventions: A comparative systematic review and multivariate meta-analysis\nAuthors: Packheiser, J.; Hartmann, H.; Fredriksen, K.; Gazzola, V.; Keysers, C.; Michon, F.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291651\nIntroductionReceiving touch is of critical importance for human well-being. A large number of studies have shown that touch promotes mental and physical health. However, effect sizes differ considerably across studies and potential moderators of touch interventions remain unknown to this day. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and a large-scale multivariate multilevel meta-analysis encompassing 137 randomized-controlled studies in healthy participants and patients (166 cohorts, 9617 participants and 643 effect sizes) to identify critical factors moderating touch and research on touch intervention targets. ResultsWe found comparable and medium-sized (g [~] 0.5) effects of touch on both mental and physical health. Touch interventions were especially effective in regulating cortisol levels and increasing weight in newborns, as well as in reducing pain, feelings of depression and anxiety for adults and children. Touch interventions involving objects or robots resulted in similar physical but lower mental health benefits than human interactions. Clinical cohorts profited stronger in mental health domains but showed comparable physical health benefits as healthy individuals. Familiarity between the touch dyad was inconsequential in children and adults but critical in newborns. The number of sessions positively correlated with increased mental and physical health benefits in adults and children while session duration did not show significant effects. DiscussionLeveraging those factors that influence touch intervention efficacy will help maximize the benefits of future social touch interventions and focus research in this field.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionReceiving touch is of critical importance for human well-being. A large number of studies have shown that touch promotes mental and physical health. However, effect sizes differ considerably across studies and potential moderators of touch interventions remain unknown to this day.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and a large-scale multivariate multilevel meta-analysis encompassing 137 randomized-controlled studies in healthy participants and patients (166 cohorts, 9617 participants and 643 effect sizes) to identify critical factors moderating touch and research on touch intervention targets.

ResultsWe found comparable and medium-sized (g [~] 0.5) effects of touch on both mental and physical health. Touch interventions were especially effective in regulating cortisol levels and increasing weight in newborns, as well as in reducing pain, feelings of depression and anxiety for adults and children. Touch interventions involving objects or robots resulted in similar physical but lower mental health benefits than human interactions. Clinical cohorts profited stronger in mental health domains but showed comparable physical health benefits as healthy individuals. Familiarity between the touch dyad was inconsequential in children and adults but critical in newborns. The number of sessions positively correlated with increased mental and physical health benefits in adults and children while session duration did not show significant effects.

DiscussionLeveraging those factors that influence touch intervention efficacy will help maximize the benefits of future social touch interventions and focus research in this field.</p>
