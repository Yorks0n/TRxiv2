During COVID-19 pandemic several public health measures were implemented by diverse countries to reduce the risk of COVID-19, including social distancing. Here we collected the minimal distance recommended by each country for physical distancing at the onset of the pandemic and aimed to examine whether it had an impact on the outbreak dynamics and how this specific value was chosen.">

Here we collected the minimal distance recommended by each country for physical distancing at the onset of the pandemic and aimed to examine whether it had an impact on the outbreak dynamics and how this specific value was chosen. Despite an absence of data on SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission at the beginning of the pandemic, we found that most countries recommended physical distancing with a precise minimal distance, between one meter/three feet and two meters/six feet. 45% of the countries advised one meter/three feet and 49% advised a higher minimal distance. The recommended minimal distance did not show a clear correlation with reproduction rate nor with the number of new cases per million, suggesting that the overall COVID-19 dynamics in each country depended on multiple interacting factors. Interestingly, the recommended minimal distance correlated with several cultural parameters: it was higher in countries with larger interpersonal distance between two interacting individuals in non-epidemic conditions, and it correlated with civil law systems, and with currency. This suggests that countries which share common conceptions such as civil law systems and currency unions tend to adopt the same public health measures.\nValidating an Approach for Estimating Appropriate Black Participation in Clinical Trials\nAuthors: Berg, J. M.; Celedon, J. C.; Jonassaint, N. N.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293100\nRepresentation of different groups at appropriate levels in clinical trials is of great importance. Factors affecting what appropriate levels include the demographics at the trial sites and the prevalence of the condition under study in different populations. We examined 359 trials published in New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), and the Lancet in 2020 for information about Black participation rates. Sufficient information for analysis was available in 58 trials. Simulations including both site demographics and prevalence factors revealed that observed Black participation rates were reasonably well correlated with estimated potential Black participation rates, but that actual participation rates were lower than potential rates in 47 out of 58 trials. This approach could be used to estimate appropriate participation rates prior to trial initiation and for analysis of trials upon completion. Promotion of such transparency standards will aid future analyses and should help drive improvements in representation over time. Clinical trials represent important opportunities to test potential interventions in groups of individuals who can provide meaningful data and who represent populations who might benefit from the trial results. This has been described and highlighted by the recent report \"Improving Representation in Clinical Trials and Research: Building Research Equity for Women and Underrepresented Groups\" from the United States National Academy of Sciences1.

Design, Setting and ParticipantsRetrospective cross-sectional study of MMWR publications pertaining to masks from 1978 to 2023. Main outcome measuresStudy date, design, disease focus, setting, population and location. Whether the study was able to assess mask effectiveness, if results were statistically significant, if masks were concluded to be effective, if randomized evidence and/or conflicting data was mentioned or cited, if causal statements were made about effectiveness, and, if so, whether they were appropriate. Results77 studies, all published after 2019, met our inclusion criteria. 75/77 (97.4%) studies were from the United States alone. All geographic regions and age groups were represented. The most common study design was observational without a comparator group 22/77 (28.6%). The most common setting was the community (35/77;45.5%). 0/77 were randomized studies. 23/77 (29.9%) assessed mask effectiveness, with 11/77 (14.3%) being statistically significant, but 58/77 (75.3%) stated masks were effective. Of these, 41/58 (70.7%) used causal language. Only one mannequin study used causal language appropriately (1.3%). 72/77 (93.5%) pertained to SARS-CoV-2 alone. None cited randomized data. 1/77 (1.3%) cited conflicting evidence. Conclusions and RelevanceMMWR publications pertaining to masks drew positive conclusions about mask effectiveness over 75% of the time despite only 30% testing masks and \u003c15% having statistically significant results. No studies were randomized, yet over half drew causal conclusions. The level of evidence generated was low and the conclusions drawn were most often unsupported by the data. Our findings raise concern about the reliability of the journal for informing health policy.\n",

Results77 studies, all published after 2019, met our inclusion criteria. 75/77 (97.4%) studies were from the United States alone. All geographic regions and age groups were represented. The most common study design was observational without a comparator group 22/77 (28.6%). The most common setting was the community (35/77;45.5%). 0/77 were randomized studies. 23/77 (29.9%) assessed mask effectiveness, with 11/77 (14.3%) being statistically significant, but 58/77 (75.3%) stated masks were effective. Of these, 41/58 (70.7%) used causal language. Only one mannequin study used causal language appropriately (1.3%). 72/77 (93.5%) pertained to SARS-CoV-2 alone. None cited randomized data. 1/77 (1.3%) cited conflicting evidence.

Conclusions and RelevanceMMWR publications pertaining to masks drew positive conclusions about mask effectiveness over 75% of the time despite only 30% testing masks and &lt;15% having statistically significant results. No studies were randomized, yet over half drew causal conclusions. The level of evidence generated was low and the conclusions drawn were most often unsupported by the data. Our findings raise concern about the reliability of the journal for informing health policy.</p>
