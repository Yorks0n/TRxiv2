A large number of studies have shown that touch promotes mental and physical health. However, effect sizes differ considerably across studies and potential moderators of touch interventions remain unknown to this day. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and a large-scale multivariate multilevel meta-analysis encompassing 137 randomized-controlled studies in healthy participants and patients (166 cohorts, 9617 participants and 643 effect sizes) to identify critical factors moderating touch and research on touch intervention targets. ResultsWe found comparable and medium-sized (g [~] 0.5) effects of touch on both mental and physical health. Touch interventions were especially effective in regulating cortisol levels and increasing weight in newborns, as well as in reducing pain, feelings of depression and anxiety for adults and children. Touch interventions involving objects or robots resulted in similar physical but lower mental health benefits than human interactions. Clinical cohorts profited stronger in mental health domains but showed comparable physical health benefits as healthy individuals. Familiarity between the touch dyad was inconsequential in children and adults but critical in newborns. The number of sessions positively correlated with increased mental and physical health benefits in adults and children while session duration did not show significant effects. DiscussionLeveraging those factors that influence touch intervention efficacy will help maximize the benefits of future social touch interventions and focus research in this field.\nWhat is the forecasted prevalence and incidence of long-term conditions in Wales: a rapid evidence map\nAuthors: Edwards, D.; Csontos, J.; Gillen, E.; Huthchinson, G.; Sha'aban, A.; Carrier, J. A.; Lewis, R.; Edwards, R. T.; Davies, J.; Collins, B.; Cooper, A.; Edwards, A. G.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291814\nIt is becoming apparent that the NHS will face many issues in years to come due to the growth of ageing population in relation to the working age population alongside the increase in multimorbidity and persistent health inequalities, particularly for preventable illness. This has implications to how healthcare and health systems are delivered, and how the NHS will need to adapt to meet the increasing demand that this places on healthcare services. This rapid evidence map reports forecasted prevalence and incidence data across a range of long -term conditions in Wales to support planning about how best to organise and finance care for the increasing population with long-term conditions over the next 10 years. The findings by conditions include: atrial fibrillation, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, dementia, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, mental illness, and multi-morbidities. Three risk factors for long term conditions were also included, i.e., poor diet/nutrition, obesity, and smoking. The review included evidence from 2012 to March 2023 Implications for policy and practiceResults show which long-term conditions are projected to increase over 10 years or more. Further preventive interventions through behavioural science approaches, with increased investment, should be considered to mitigate the rising prevalence of several preventable conditions. Smoking, excessive drinking and obesity are candidates for targeted preventive work, especially in areas of deprivation, to lessen health inequalities. Further research is needed for some conditions, and to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the burden of these conditions in Wales. Earlier diagnosis by genetic and genomic technologies and enabling lifestyle changes or by more cost-effective home care could reduce NHS costs of some long-term conditions.\nSustainability Indexes as Possible Predictors of Excess Mortality across OECD Countries during the Covid-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: LIU, L.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23291035\nThis study considered the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index, Human Development Index (HDI), and Environmental Performance Index (EPI) as sustainability indexes and explored their potential effectiveness as predictors of Covid-19 excess mortality among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The results indicated strong negative correlations between each index and Covid-19 excess mortality. Each of the indexes was able to consistently predict variations in excess mortality in the regression models. Such findings contribute to the current discussion on what lessons we should take away from the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically whether sustainability indexes may be useful in assessing Covid-19 outcomes. It is valuable to further examine the role sustainable policies and practices can play in preparing for future crises, as it has been demonstrated that social, economic, and environmental factors influenced the ability of a country to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. Overall, the most effective way for a country to both prevent and prepare for the next crisis is to improve health, education, and standard of living for its people, protect the environment, and achieve sustainability.\n",
