However, existing disability training for health workers is usually delivered in one-off interventions, with little follow-up, evaluation, and focus on long-term learning. This insufficiency makes it important to understand how disability training for health workers can be more effective. Therefore, we interviewed stakeholders involved in an existing disability training intervention in Ghana to understand how disability training for health workers could be improved. MethodsIn-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 people involved in disability training (either as trainers or trainees) in Ghana. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. ResultsParticipants spoke about the challenges with existing training, namely how the current approach was insufficient, the consequences of informality in running training and the need for more sign language instruction. Several participants suggested improvements for training, including having external motivation (i.e., professional development credits, monetary benefits, etc.), more collaborative initiatives across institutions and government, and curriculum integration. We developed a theory of change model to show how different components of disability training support learning. DiscussionThese results show that disability training for health workers is important and that there is scope to refine and standardize training. In particular, the findings demonstrate how future initiatives to train health workers can be developed and implemented. They also emphasize the need to solicit perspectives from individuals who have experienced training in order to improve future iterations.\nEstimating the optimal age for infant measles vaccination\nAuthors: Goult, E. A.; Barrero Guevara, L. A.; Briga, M.; Domenech de Celles, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298759\nThe persistence of measles in many regions demonstrates large immunity gaps, resulting from incomplete or ineffective immunization with measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). A key factor affecting MCV impact is age, with infants receiving dose 1 (MCV1) at older ages having a reduced risk of vaccine failure, but also an increased risk of contracting infection before vaccination. Here, we designed a new method--based on a transmission model incorporating realistic vaccination delays and age variations in MCV1 effectiveness--to capture this risk trade-off and estimate the optimal age for recommending MCV1. We predict a large heterogeneity in the optimal ages (range: 6-20 months), contrasting the homogeneity of observed recommendations worldwide. Furthermore, we show that the optimal age depends on the local epidemiology of measles, with a lower optimal age predicted in populations suffering higher transmission. Overall, our results suggest the scope for public health authorities to tailor the recommended schedule for better measles control.\n",
