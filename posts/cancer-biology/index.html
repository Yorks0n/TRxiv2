J.\nScore: 283.4, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562892\nDiffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are lethal brain tumors characterized by p53-inactivating mutations and oncohistone H3.3K27M mutations that rewire the cellular response to genotoxic stress, which presents therapeutic opportunities. We used RCAS/tv-a retroviruses and Cre recombinase to inactivate p53 and induce K27M in the native H3f3a allele in a lineage- and spatially-directed manner, yielding primary mouse DMGs. Genetic or pharmacologic disruption of the DNA damage response kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) enhanced the efficacy of focal brain irradiation, extending mouse survival. This finding suggests that targeting ATM will enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy for p53-mutant DMG but not p53-wildtype DMG. We used spatial in situ transcriptomics and an allelic series of primary murine DMG models with different p53 mutations to identify transactivation-independent p53 activity as a key mediator of such radiosensitivity. These studies deeply profile a genetically faithful and versatile model of a lethal brain tumor to identify resistance mechanisms for a therapeutic strategy currently in clinical trials.\nPrograms, Origins, and Niches of Immunomodulatory Myeloid Cells in Gliomas\nAuthors: Miller, T.

H.; Guerriero, J. L.; Petrecca, K.; Suva, M. L.; Shalek, A. K.; Bernstein, B. E.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563466\nGliomas are incurable malignancies notable for an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells whose immunomodulatory properties remain poorly defined. Here, utilizing scRNA-seq data for 183,062 myeloid cells from 85 human tumors, we discover that nearly all glioma-associated myeloid cells express at least one of four immunomodulatory activity programs: Scavenger Immunosuppressive, C1Q Immunosuppressive, CXCR4 Inflammatory, and IL1B Inflammatory. All four programs are present in IDH1 mutant and wild-type gliomas and are expressed in macrophages, monocytes, and microglia whether of blood or resident myeloid cell origins. Integrating our scRNA-seq data with mitochondrial DNA-based lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, and organoid explant systems that model peripheral monocyte infiltration, we show that these programs are driven by microenvironmental cues and therapies rather than myeloid cell type, origin, or mutation status. The C1Q Immunosuppressive program is driven by routinely administered dexamethasone. The Scavenger Immunosuppressive program includes ligands with established roles in T-cell suppression, is induced in hypoxic regions, and is associated with immunotherapy resistance. Both immunosuppressive programs are less prevalent in lower-grade gliomas, which are instead enriched for the CXCR4 Inflammatory program. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulatory myeloid cells in glioma, and a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapies.\nBorrowing Transcriptional Kinases to Activate Apoptosis\nAuthors: Sarott, R. C.; Gourisankar, S. P.; Karim, B. A.; Nettles, S.; Yang, H.; Dwyer, B.; Simanauskaite, J. M.; Tse, J.; Abuzaid, H.; Krokhotin, A.; Zhang, T.; Hinshaw, S. M.; Green, M. R.; Crabtree, G. R.; Gray, N.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563687\nProtein kinases are disease drivers whose therapeutic targeting traditionally centers on inhibition of enzymatic activity. Here chemically induced proximity is leveraged to convert kinase inhibitors into context-specific activators of therapeutic genes. Bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to ATP-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were developed to re-localize CDK to BCL6-bound loci on chromatin and direct phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. The resulting BCL6-target proapoptotic gene expression translated into killing of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells at 72 h with EC50s of 0.9 - 10 nM and highly specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response in mice. The molecules exhibited 10,000-fold lower cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes and are well tolerated in mice. Genomic and proteomic evidence corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism where, instead of global enzyme inhibition, a fraction of total kinase activity is borrowed and re-localized to BCL6-bound loci. The strategy demonstrates how kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription, accessing new therapeutic space.\nInteractions between ploidy and resource availability shape clonal interference at initiation and recurrence of glioblastoma\nAuthors: Nowicka, Z.; Rentzeperis, F.; Beck, R.; Tagal, V.; Forero Pinto, A.

P.; Katira, P.; Andor, N.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562670\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. Complete surgical resection of GBM is almost impossible due to the infiltrative nature of the cancer. While no evidence for recent selection events have been found after diagnosis, the selective forces that govern gliomagenesis are strong, shaping the tumors cell composition during the initial progression to malignancy with late consequences for invasiveness and therapy response. We present a mathematical model that simulates the growth and invasion of a glioma, given its ploidy level and the nature of its brain tissue micro-environment (TME), and use it to make inferences about GBM initiation and response to standard-of-care treatment. We approximate the spatial distribution of resource access in the TME through integration of in-silico modelling, multi-omics data and image analysis of primary and recurrent GBM. In the pre-malignant setting, our in-silico results suggest that low ploidy cancer cells are more resistant to starvation-induced cell death. In the malignant setting, between first and second surgery, simulated tumors with different ploidy compositions progressed at different rates. Whether higher ploidy predicted fast recurrence, however, depended on the TME. Historical data supports this dependence on TME resources, as shown by a significant correlation between the median glucose uptake rates in human tissues and the median ploidy of cancer types that arise in the respective tissues (Spearman r = -0.70; P = 0.026). Taken together our findings suggest that availability of metabolic substrates in the TME drives different cell fate decisions for cancer cells with different ploidy and shapes GBM disease initiation and relapse characteristics.\nDosage amplification dictates oncogenic regulation by the NKX2-1 lineage factor in lung adenocarcinoma\nAuthors: Pulice, J. L.; Meyerson, M.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.563996\nAmplified oncogene expression is a critical and widespread driver event in cancer, yet our understanding of how amplification-mediated elevated dosage mediates oncogenic regulation is limited. Here, we find that the most significant focal amplification event in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) targets a lineage super-enhancer near the NKX2-1 lineage transcription factor. The NKX2-1 super-enhancer is targeted by focal and co-amplification with NKX2-1, and activation or repression controls NKX2-1 expression. We find that NKX2-1 is a widespread dependency in LUAD cell lines, where NKX2-1 pioneers enhancer accessibility to drive a lineage addicted state in LUAD, and NKX2-1 confers persistence to EGFR inhibitors. Notably, we find that oncogenic NKX2-1 regulation requires expression above a minimum dosage threshold--NKX2-1 dosage below this threshold is insufficient for cell viability, enhancer remodeling, and TKI persistence. Our data suggest that copy-number amplification can be a gain-of-function alteration, wherein amplification elevates oncogene expression above a critical dosage required for oncogenic regulation and cancer cell survival. O_LSTHighlightsC_LSTO_LIThe most significant amplification event in LUAD targets a lineage super-enhancer that controls expression of the NKX2-1 lineage oncogene. C_LIO_LINKX2-1 is a dosage dependency in most NKX2-1(+) LUAD cell lines C_LIO_LINKX2-1 remodels lineage enhancer accessibility to drive a lineage addicted state and confer persistence to EGFR targeted therapy C_LIO_LINKX2-1 oncogenic regulation requires a minimum oncogenic dosage, which dictates NKX2-1 regulation of enhancer remodeling, TKI persistence, and cancer cell viability C_LI\nCo-regulator activity of Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1 (MDC1) is associated with DNA repair dysfunction and PARP inhibitor sensitivity in lobular carcinoma of the breast\nAuthors: Sottnik, J. L.; Shackleford, M. T.; Richer, A. L.; Fu, R.; Hesselberth, J. R.; Sikora, M. J.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564555\nInvasive lobular carcinoma of the breast (ILC) are typically estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and present with biomarkers of anti-estrogen sensitive disease, but growing laboratory and clinical data, including poor long-term outcomes faced by patients with ILC, suggest endocrine response and ER function are unique in ILC. We previously identified the DNA repair protein Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1 (MDC1) as an ILC-specific ER co-regulator necessary for ER genomic activity, and that MDC1 co-regulator activity was associated with dysfunctional canonical DNA repair roles of MDC1. To understand these potentially reciprocal activities of MDC1 in ILC, we profiled the MDC1 interactome and found that MDC1 associated proteins in ILC cells mirror a BRCA-mutant-like state lacking MDC1 interaction with key homologous recombination (HR) proteins. Single-cell gene expression and DNA repair activity showed that specific activation of ER:MDC1 target genes was associated with increased PARP-associated DNA repair and decreased HR gene expression. These data suggest that HR is dysfunctional in ILC, which was supported by a lack of DNA damage-induced RAD51 turnover in ILC cells, and an elevated DNA damage response protein signature in a subset of ILC tumors. We tested whether this HR dysfunction could be exploited using PARP inhibition, and found that talazoparib treatment produced a durable growth suppression both in vitro and in ILC cell line xenografts in vivo. The ILC-specific ER:MDC1 association creates a new context for ER and MDC1 function in ILC, at the cost of a DNA repair dysfunction that may be therapeutically targetable. Significance: ILC are rarely associated with biomarkers of overt HR deficiency, as such patients are rarely eligible for treatment with PARP inhibitors. Our work suggests ILC present with a previously unappreciated form of HR dysfunction, linked to ILC-specific genomic activity of ER, that imparts sensitivity to PARP inhibition.\nMissense mutations in Myc Box I influence MYC cellular localization, mRNA partitioning and turnover to promote leukemogenesis\nAuthors: Arthur, N.; Christensen, K. A.; Mannino, K.; Ruzinova, M.; Kumar, A.; Gruszczynska, A.; Day, R. B.; Erdmann-Gilmore, P.; Mi, Y.; Sprung, R.; York, C. R.; Spencer, D. H.; Townsend, R.; Sykes, S. M.; Ferraro, F.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563493\nSomatic missense mutations in the phosphodegron domain of the MYC gene (MYC Box I) are detected in the dominant clones of a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, but the mechanisms by which they contribute to AML are unknown. To unveil unique proprieties of MBI MYC mutant proteins, we systematically compared the cellular and molecular consequences of expressing similar oncogenic levels of wild type and MBI mutant MYC. We found that MBI MYC mutants can accelerate leukemia by driving unique transcriptional signatures in highly selected, myeloid progenitor subpopulations. Although these mutations increase MYC stability, they overall dampen MYC chromatin localization and lead to a cytoplasmic accumulation of the mutant proteins. This phenotype is coupled with increased translation of RNA binding proteins and nuclear export machinery, which results in altered RNA partitioning and accelerated decay of select transcripts encoding proapoptotic and proinflammatory genes. Heterozygous knockin mice harboring the germline MBI mutation Myc p.T73N exhibit cytoplasmic MYC localization, myeloid progenitors expansion with similar transcriptional signatures to the overexpression model, and eventually develop hematological malignancies. This study uncovers that MBI MYC mutations alter MYC localization and disrupt mRNA subcellular distribution and turnover of select transcripts to accelerate tumor initiation and growth.\nAnalysis of uveal melanoma scRNA sequencing data identifies neoplastic-immune hybrid cells that exhibit metastatic potential\nAuthors: Anderson, A. N.; Conley, P.; Klocke, C. D.; Sengupta, S. K.; Robinson, T. L.; Fan, Y.; Jones, J. A.; Gibbs, S. L.; Skalet, A. H.; Wu, G.; Wong, M. H.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563815\nUveal melanoma (UM) is the most common non-cutaneous melanoma and is an intraocular malignancy that affects nearly 7,000 individuals per year worldwide. Of these, nearly 50% will progress to metastatic disease for which there are currently no effective therapies. Despite advances in the molecular profiling and metastatic stratification of class 1 and 2 UM tumors, little is known regarding the underlying biology of UM metastasis. Our group has identified a disseminated neoplastic cell population characterized by co-expression of immune and melanoma proteins, circulating hybrid cells (CHCs or hybrids), in patients with UM. Compared to circulating tumor cells, CHCs are detected at an increased prevalence in peripheral blood and can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to predict metastatic progression. To identify mechanisms underlying enhanced hybrid cell dissemination we sought to identify hybrid cells within primary UM tumors, including UM tissue sections and single cell RNA sequencing. Using rigorous doublet discrimination approaches, we identified UM hybrids and evaluated their gene expression and predicted ligand-receptor interactions in relation to other melanoma and immune cells within the primary tumor. We identified several genes and pathways upregulated in hybrid cells, including those involved in enhancing cell motility and cytoskeletal rearrangement, evading immune detection, and altering cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified that hybrid cells express ligand-receptor signaling pathways implicated in promoting cancer metastasis including GAS6-AXL, CXCL12-CXCR4, LGALS9-P4HB and IGF1-IGFR1. These results contribute to our understanding of tumor progression and interactions between tumor cells and immune cells in the UM microenvironment that may promote metastasis.\nClinically relevant humanized mouse models of metastatic prostate cancer to evaluate cancer therapies\nAuthors: Kostlan, R. J.; Phoenix, J. T.; Budreika, A.; Ferrari, M. G.; Khurana, N.; Choi, J. E.; Juckette, K.; McCollum, B. L.; Moskal, R.; Qiao, Y.; Vander Griend, D. J.; Chinnaiyan, A. M.; Kregel, S.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562280\nThere is tremendous need for improved prostate cancer (PCa) models. The mouse prostate does not spontaneously form tumors and is anatomically and developmentally different from the human prostate. Engineered mouse models lack the heterogeneity of human cancer and rarely establish metastatic growth. Human xenografts represent an alternative but rely on an immunocompromised host. Accordingly, we generated PCa murine xenograft models with an intact human immune system (huNOG and huNOG-EXL mice) to test whether humanizing tumor-immune interactions would improve modeling of metastatic PCa and the impact of hormonal and immunotherapies. These mice maintain multiple human cell lineages, including functional human T-cells and myeloid cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, subcutaneous tumor size was not significantly altered across conditions; however, metastasis to secondary sites differed in castrate huNOG vs background-matched immunocompromised mice treated with enzalutamide (enza). VCaP xenograft tumors showed decreases in growth with enza and anti-Programed-Death-1 treatments in huNOG mice, and no effect was seen with treatment in NOG mice. Enza responses in huNOG and NOG mice were distinct and associated with increased T-cells within tumors of enza treated huNOG mice, and increased T-cell activation. In huNOG-EXL mice, which support human myeloid development, there was a strong population of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and Myeloid-Derived-Suppressor-Cells (MDSCs), and enza treatment showed no difference in metastasis. Results illustrate, to our knowledge, the first model of human PCa that metastasizes to clinically relevant locations, has an intact human immune system, responds appropriately to standard-of-care hormonal therapies, and can model both an immunosuppressive and checkpoint-inhibition responsive immune microenvironment.\nAndrogen blockade primes NLRP3 in macrophages to induce tumor phagocytosis\nAuthors: Chaudagar, K. K.; Srikrishnan, R.; Mei, S.; Hirz, T.; Hu, Y.-M.; Argulian, A.; Labadie, B.; Desai, K.; Grimaldo, S.; Kahramangil, D.; Nair, R.; D Souza, S.; Zhou, D.; Li, M.; Doughan, F.; Chen, R.; Shafran, J.; Loyd, M.; Xia, Z.; Sykes, D. B.; Moran, A. E.; Patnaik, A.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557996\nImmune-based therapies induce durable remissions in subsets of patients across multiple malignancies. However, there is limited efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), manifested by an enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2) tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression are critically needed in mCRPC. Here we discovered that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), an innate immune sensing protein, is highly expressed in TAM from metastatic PC patients treated with standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Importantly, ex vivo studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) blockade in TAM upregulates NLRP3 expression, but not inflammasome activity, and concurrent AR blockade/NLRP3 agonist (NLRP3a) treatment promotes cancer cell phagocytosis by immunosuppressive M2 TAM. In contrast, NLRP3a monotherapy was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in anti-tumor (M1) TAM, which exhibit high de novo NLRP3 expression. Critically, combinatorial treatment with ADT/NLRP3a in a murine model of advanced PC resulted in significant tumor control, with tumor clearance in 55% of mice via TAM phagocytosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate NLRP3 as an AR-regulated \"macrophage phagocytic checkpoint\", inducibly expressed in TAM by ADT and activated by NLRP3a treatment, the combination resulting in TAM-mediated phagocytosis and tumor control.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are lethal brain tumors characterized by p53-inactivating mutations and oncohistone H3.3K27M mutations that rewire the cellular response to genotoxic stress, which presents therapeutic opportunities. We used RCAS/tv-a retroviruses and Cre recombinase to inactivate p53 and induce K27M in the native H3f3a allele in a lineage- and spatially-directed manner, yielding primary mouse DMGs. Genetic or pharmacologic disruption of the DNA damage response kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) enhanced the efficacy of focal brain irradiation, extending mouse survival. This finding suggests that targeting ATM will enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy for p53-mutant DMG but not p53-wildtype DMG. We used spatial in situ transcriptomics and an allelic series of primary murine DMG models with different p53 mutations to identify transactivation-independent p53 activity as a key mediator of such radiosensitivity. These studies deeply profile a genetically faithful and versatile model of a lethal brain tumor to identify resistance mechanisms for a therapeutic strategy currently in clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gliomas are incurable malignancies notable for an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells whose immunomodulatory properties remain poorly defined. Here, utilizing scRNA-seq data for 183,062 myeloid cells from 85 human tumors, we discover that nearly all glioma-associated myeloid cells express at least one of four immunomodulatory activity programs: Scavenger Immunosuppressive, C1Q Immunosuppressive, CXCR4 Inflammatory, and IL1B Inflammatory. All four programs are present in IDH1 mutant and wild-type gliomas and are expressed in macrophages, monocytes, and microglia whether of blood or resident myeloid cell origins. Integrating our scRNA-seq data with mitochondrial DNA-based lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, and organoid explant systems that model peripheral monocyte infiltration, we show that these programs are driven by microenvironmental cues and therapies rather than myeloid cell type, origin, or mutation status. The C1Q Immunosuppressive program is driven by routinely administered dexamethasone. The Scavenger Immunosuppressive program includes ligands with established roles in T-cell suppression, is induced in hypoxic regions, and is associated with immunotherapy resistance. Both immunosuppressive programs are less prevalent in lower-grade gliomas, which are instead enriched for the CXCR4 Inflammatory program. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulatory myeloid cells in glioma, and a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein kinases are disease drivers whose therapeutic targeting traditionally centers on inhibition of enzymatic activity. Here chemically induced proximity is leveraged to convert kinase inhibitors into context-specific activators of therapeutic genes. Bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to ATP-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were developed to re-localize CDK to BCL6-bound loci on chromatin and direct phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. The resulting BCL6-target proapoptotic gene expression translated into killing of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells at 72 h with EC50s of 0.9 - 10 nM and highly specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response in mice. The molecules exhibited 10,000-fold lower cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes and are well tolerated in mice. Genomic and proteomic evidence corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism where, instead of global enzyme inhibition, a fraction of total kinase activity is borrowed and re-localized to BCL6-bound loci. The strategy demonstrates how kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription, accessing new therapeutic space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. Complete surgical resection of GBM is almost impossible due to the infiltrative nature of the cancer. While no evidence for recent selection events have been found after diagnosis, the selective forces that govern gliomagenesis are strong, shaping the tumors cell composition during the initial progression to malignancy with late consequences for invasiveness and therapy response. We present a mathematical model that simulates the growth and invasion of a glioma, given its ploidy level and the nature of its brain tissue micro-environment (TME), and use it to make inferences about GBM initiation and response to standard-of-care treatment. We approximate the spatial distribution of resource access in the TME through integration of in-silico modelling, multi-omics data and image analysis of primary and recurrent GBM. In the pre-malignant setting, our in-silico results suggest that low ploidy cancer cells are more resistant to starvation-induced cell death. In the malignant setting, between first and second surgery, simulated tumors with different ploidy compositions progressed at different rates. Whether higher ploidy predicted fast recurrence, however, depended on the TME. Historical data supports this dependence on TME resources, as shown by a significant correlation between the median glucose uptake rates in human tissues and the median ploidy of cancer types that arise in the respective tissues (Spearman r = -0.70; P = 0.026). Taken together our findings suggest that availability of metabolic substrates in the TME drives different cell fate decisions for cancer cells with different ploidy and shapes GBM disease initiation and relapse characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Amplified oncogene expression is a critical and widespread driver event in cancer, yet our understanding of how amplification-mediated elevated dosage mediates oncogenic regulation is limited. Here, we find that the most significant focal amplification event in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) targets a lineage super-enhancer near the NKX2-1 lineage transcription factor. The NKX2-1 super-enhancer is targeted by focal and co-amplification with NKX2-1, and activation or repression controls NKX2-1 expression. We find that NKX2-1 is a widespread dependency in LUAD cell lines, where NKX2-1 pioneers enhancer accessibility to drive a lineage addicted state in LUAD, and NKX2-1 confers persistence to EGFR inhibitors. Notably, we find that oncogenic NKX2-1 regulation requires expression above a minimum dosage threshold--NKX2-1 dosage below this threshold is insufficient for cell viability, enhancer remodeling, and TKI persistence. Our data suggest that copy-number amplification can be a gain-of-function alteration, wherein amplification elevates oncogene expression above a critical dosage required for oncogenic regulation and cancer cell survival.

        <p class="abstract">Invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast (ILC) are typically estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and present with biomarkers of anti-estrogen sensitive disease, but growing laboratory and clinical data, including poor long-term outcomes faced by patients with ILC, suggest endocrine response and ER function are unique in ILC. We previously identified the DNA repair protein Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1 (MDC1) as an ILC-specific ER co-regulator necessary for ER genomic activity, and that MDC1 co-regulator activity was associated with dysfunctional canonical DNA repair roles of MDC1. To understand these potentially reciprocal activities of MDC1 in ILC, we profiled the MDC1 interactome and found that MDC1 associated proteins in ILC cells mirror a BRCA-mutant-like state lacking MDC1 interaction with key homologous recombination (HR) proteins. Single-cell gene expression and DNA repair activity showed that specific activation of ER:MDC1 target genes was associated with increased PARP-associated DNA repair and decreased HR gene expression. These data suggest that HR is dysfunctional in ILC, which was supported by a lack of DNA damage-induced RAD51 turnover in ILC cells, and an elevated DNA damage response protein signature in a subset of ILC tumors. We tested whether this HR dysfunction could be exploited using PARP inhibition, and found that talazoparib treatment produced a durable growth suppression both in vitro and in ILC cell line xenografts in vivo. The ILC-specific ER:MDC1 association creates a new context for ER and MDC1 function in ILC, at the cost of a DNA repair dysfunction that may be therapeutically targetable. Significance: ILC are rarely associated with biomarkers of overt HR deficiency, as such patients are rarely eligible for treatment with PARP inhibitors. Our work suggests ILC present with a previously unappreciated form of HR dysfunction, linked to ILC-specific genomic activity of ER, that imparts sensitivity to PARP inhibition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Somatic missense mutations in the phosphodegron domain of the MYC gene (MYC Box I) are detected in the dominant clones of a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, but the mechanisms by which they contribute to AML are unknown. To unveil unique proprieties of MBI MYC mutant proteins, we systematically compared the cellular and molecular consequences of expressing similar oncogenic levels of wild type and MBI mutant MYC. We found that MBI MYC mutants can accelerate leukemia by driving unique transcriptional signatures in highly selected, myeloid progenitor subpopulations. Although these mutations increase MYC stability, they overall dampen MYC chromatin localization and lead to a cytoplasmic accumulation of the mutant proteins. This phenotype is coupled with increased translation of RNA binding proteins and nuclear export machinery, which results in altered RNA partitioning and accelerated decay of select transcripts encoding proapoptotic and proinflammatory genes. Heterozygous knockin mice harboring the germline MBI mutation Myc p.T73N exhibit cytoplasmic MYC localization, myeloid progenitors expansion with similar transcriptional signatures to the overexpression model, and eventually develop hematological malignancies. This study uncovers that MBI MYC mutations alter MYC localization and disrupt mRNA subcellular distribution and turnover of select transcripts to accelerate tumor initiation and growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common non-cutaneous melanoma and is an intraocular malignancy that affects nearly 7,000 individuals per year worldwide. Of these, nearly 50% will progress to metastatic disease for which there are currently no effective therapies. Despite advances in the molecular profiling and metastatic stratification of class 1 and 2 UM tumors, little is known regarding the underlying biology of UM metastasis. Our group has identified a disseminated neoplastic cell population characterized by co-expression of immune and melanoma proteins, circulating hybrid cells (CHCs or hybrids), in patients with UM. Compared to circulating tumor cells, CHCs are detected at an increased prevalence in peripheral blood and can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to predict metastatic progression. To identify mechanisms underlying enhanced hybrid cell dissemination we sought to identify hybrid cells within primary UM tumors, including UM tissue sections and single cell RNA sequencing. Using rigorous doublet discrimination approaches, we identified UM hybrids and evaluated their gene expression and predicted ligand-receptor interactions in relation to other melanoma and immune cells within the primary tumor. We identified several genes and pathways upregulated in hybrid cells, including those involved in enhancing cell motility and cytoskeletal rearrangement, evading immune detection, and altering cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified that hybrid cells express ligand-receptor signaling pathways implicated in promoting cancer metastasis including GAS6-AXL, CXCL12-CXCR4, LGALS9-P4HB and IGF1-IGFR1. These results contribute to our understanding of tumor progression and interactions between tumor cells and immune cells in the UM microenvironment that may promote metastasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is tremendous need for improved prostate cancer (PCa) models. The mouse prostate does not spontaneously form tumors and is anatomically and developmentally different from the human prostate. Engineered mouse models lack the heterogeneity of human cancer and rarely establish metastatic growth. Human xenografts represent an alternative but rely on an immunocompromised host. Accordingly, we generated PCa murine xenograft models with an intact human immune system (huNOG and huNOG-EXL mice) to test whether humanizing tumor-immune interactions would improve modeling of metastatic PCa and the impact of hormonal and immunotherapies. These mice maintain multiple human cell lineages, including functional human T-cells and myeloid cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, subcutaneous tumor size was not significantly altered across conditions; however, metastasis to secondary sites differed in castrate huNOG vs background-matched immunocompromised mice treated with enzalutamide (enza). VCaP xenograft tumors showed decreases in growth with enza and anti-Programed-Death-1 treatments in huNOG mice, and no effect was seen with treatment in NOG mice. Enza responses in huNOG and NOG mice were distinct and associated with increased T-cells within tumors of enza treated huNOG mice, and increased T-cell activation. In huNOG-EXL mice, which support human myeloid development, there was a strong population of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and Myeloid-Derived-Suppressor-Cells (MDSCs), and enza treatment showed no difference in metastasis. Results illustrate, to our knowledge, the first model of human PCa that metastasizes to clinically relevant locations, has an intact human immune system, responds appropriately to standard-of-care hormonal therapies, and can model both an immunosuppressive and checkpoint-inhibition responsive immune microenvironment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune-based therapies induce durable remissions in subsets of patients across multiple malignancies. However, there is limited efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), manifested by an enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2) tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression are critically needed in mCRPC. Here we discovered that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), an innate immune sensing protein, is highly expressed in TAM from metastatic PC patients treated with standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Importantly, ex vivo studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) blockade in TAM upregulates NLRP3 expression, but not inflammasome activity, and concurrent AR blockade/NLRP3 agonist (NLRP3a) treatment promotes cancer cell phagocytosis by immunosuppressive M2 TAM. In contrast, NLRP3a monotherapy was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in anti-tumor (M1) TAM, which exhibit high de novo NLRP3 expression. Critically, combinatorial treatment with ADT/NLRP3a in a murine model of advanced PC resulted in significant tumor control, with tumor clearance in 55% of mice via TAM phagocytosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate NLRP3 as an AR-regulated &#34;macrophage phagocytic checkpoint&#34;, inducibly expressed in TAM by ADT and activated by NLRP3a treatment, the combination resulting in TAM-mediated phagocytosis and tumor control.</p>
