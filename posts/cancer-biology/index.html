M.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2024-02-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.578742\nHomologous recombination (HR) deficiency enhances sensitivity to DNA damaging agents commonly used to treat cancer. In HR-proficient cancers, metabolic mechanisms driving response or resistance to DNA damaging agents remain unclear. Here we identified that depletion of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG) sensitizes HR-proficient cells to DNA damaging agents by metabolic regulation of histone acetylation. KG is required for the activity of KG-dependent dioxygenases (KGDDs), and prior work has shown that changes in KGDD affect demethylases. Using a targeted CRISPR knockout library consisting of 64 KGDDs, we discovered that Trimethyllysine Hydroxylase Epsilon (TMLHE), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo carnitine synthesis, is necessary for proliferation of HR-proficient cells in the presence of DNA damaging agents. Unexpectedly, KG-mediated TMLHE-dependent carnitine synthesis was required for histone acetylation, while histone methylation was affected but dispensable. The increase in histone acetylation via KG-dependent carnitine synthesis promoted HR-mediated DNA repair through site- and substrate-specific histone acetylation. These data demonstrate for the first time that HR-proficiency is mediated through KG directly influencing histone acetylation via carnitine synthesis.\nGene regulatory network landscape of Group 3/4 medulloblastoma\nAuthors: Joshi, P.; Stelzer, T.; Okonechnikov, K.; Sarropoulos, I.; Sepp, M.; Pour-Jamnani, M.

M.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579680\nResolving the molecular mechanisms driving childhood brain tumors will uncover tumor-specific vulnerabilities and advance mechanism-of-action-based therapies. Here we describe a continuum of cell-states in Group 3/4 medulloblastomas, the most frequent and fatal cerebellar embryonal tumor subgroups, based on the differential activity of transcription-factor-driven gene networks derived using a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-omic medulloblastoma atlas. We show that Group 3/4 tumor diversity stems from enriched cell-states along four molecular identity axes: photoreceptor, MYC, precursor, and unipolar brush cell-like. We identified a potential role of PAX6 in driving dual Group 3- and Group 4-like tumor trajectories in subtype VII tumors. Our study demonstrates how oncogenic events together with lineage determinants drive Group 3/4 tumor identity away from their original source in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage.\nMechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma\nAuthors: Hunter, M. V.; Montal, E.; Ma, Y.; Moncada, R.; Yanai, I.; Koche, R. P.; White, R. M.\nScore: 32.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577120\nPhenotype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes - proliferative versus invasive states. While it has long been hypothesised that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumor cells at the interface between the tumor and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of these rare cells showed flattened, elliptical nuclei suggestive of mechanical confinement by adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that the interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favor the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumor cells are less proliferative but more drug resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism driving phenotype switching in melanoma.\nBroad de-regulated U2AF1 splicing is prognostic and augments leukemic transformation via protein arginine methyltransferase activation\nAuthors: Venkatasubramanian, M.; Schwartz, L.; Ramachandra, N.; Bennett, J.; Subramanian, K.

G.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578798\nThe role of splicing dysregulation in cancer is underscored by splicing factor mutations; however, its impact in the absence of such rare mutations is poorly understood. To reveal complex patient subtypes and putative regulators of pathogenic splicing in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), we developed a new approach called OncoSplice. Among diverse new subtypes, OncoSplice identified a biphasic poor prognosis signature that partially phenocopies U2AF1-mutant splicing, impacting thousands of genes in over 40% of adult and pediatric AML cases. U2AF1-like splicing co-opted a healthy circadian splicing program, was stable over time and induced a leukemia stem cell (LSC) program. Pharmacological inhibition of the implicated U2AF1-like splicing regulator, PRMT5, rescued leukemia mis-splicing and inhibited leukemic cell growth. Genetic deletion of IRAK4, a common target of U2AF1-like and PRMT5 treated cells, blocked leukemia development in xenograft models and induced differentiation. These analyses reveal a new prognostic alternative-splicing mechanism in malignancy, independent of splicing-factor mutations. Statement of significanceUsing a new in silico strategy we reveal counteracting determinants of patient survival in Acute Myeloid Leukemia that co-opt well-defined mutation-dependent splicing programs. Broad poor-prognosis splicing and leukemia stem cell survival could be rescued through pharmacological inhibition (PRMT5) or target deletion (IRAK4), opening the door for new precision therapies.

B. G.; Statz, B.; Sepp, M.; Sarropoulos, I.; Yamada-Saito, T.; Vaillant, J.; Wittmann, A.; Schramm, K.; Blattner-Johnson, M.; Fiesel, P.; Jones, B.; Milde, T.; Pajtler, K.; van Tilburg, C.

M.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579690\nDespite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of Group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in pediatric neuro-oncology. Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoral heterogeneity in Group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in the majority of cases, large-scale copy-number aberrations prevail. However, intratumoral heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad CNVs in tumor evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of Group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC, MYCN, and PRDM6. We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumor initiating events, while the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically sub-clonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumor development and therapy resistance. We identify that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumor tissue using spatial transcriptomics, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell-lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease.\nIdentification of early-stage liver fibrosis by modifications in the interstitial space diffusive microenvironment using fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes\nAuthors: Lee, A.; Simon, A. A.; Boyreau, A.; Allain-Courtois, N.; Lambert, B.; PRADERE, J.-P.; SALTEL, F.; Cognet, L.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579133\nDuring liver fibrosis, recurrent hepatic injuries lead to accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix components in the interstitial space, ultimately disrupting liver functions. Early stages of liver fibrosis may be reversible, but opportunities for diagnosis at these stages are currently limited. Here, we show that the alterations of the interstitial space associated with fibrosis can be probed by tracking individual fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) diffusing in that space. In a mouse model of early liver fibrosis, we find that nanotubes generally explore elongated areas, whose length decrease as the disease progresses even in regions where histopathological examination does not reveal fibrosis yet. Furthermore, this decrease in nanotube mobility is a purely geometrical effect, as the instantaneous nanotube diffusivity stays unmodified. This work establishes the promise of SWCNTs both for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis at an early stage, and for more in-depth studies of the biophysical effects of the disease.\nAlternative splice variants of the mitochondrial fission protein DNM1L/Drp1 regulate mitochondrial dynamics and cell fate in ovarian cancer.\nAuthors: Javed, Z.; Shin, D. H.; Pan, W.; White, S. R.; Kim, Y. S.; Elhaw, A. T.; Kamlapurkar, S.; Cheng, Y.-Y.; Benson, J. C.; Abdelnaby, A. E.; Phaeton, R.; Wang, H.-G.; Yang, S.; Sullivan, M. L. G.; St. Croix, C.; Watkins, S. C.; Mullett, S. J.; Gelhaus, S. L.; Lee, N. Y.; Coffman, L.; Aird, K. M.; Trebak, M.; Karthikeyan, M.; Walter, V.; Hempel, N.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558501\nAberrant mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics have been reported in cancer cells. While post translational modifications are known regulators of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, we show that alternative splice variants of the fission protein Drp1 (DNM1L) have specific and unique roles in cancer, adding to the complexity of mitochondrial fission/fusion regulation in tumor cells. Ovarian cancer specimens express an alternative splice transcript variant of Drp1 lacking exon 16 of the variable domain, and high expression of this splice variant relative to other transcripts is associated with poor patient outcome. Unlike the full-length variant, expression of Drp1 lacking exon 16 leads to decreased association of Drp1 to mitochondrial fission sites, more fused mitochondrial networks, enhanced respiration, and TCA cycle metabolites, and is associated with a more metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These pro-tumorigenic effects can also be inhibited by specific siRNA-mediated inhibition of the endogenously expressed transcript lacking exon 16. Moreover, lack of exon 16 abrogates mitochondrial fission in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli and leads to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. These data emphasize the significance of the pathophysiological consequences of Drp1 alternative splicing and divergent functions of Drp1 splice variants, and strongly warrant consideration of Drp1 splicing in future studies.\nCoordinated Immune Cell Networks in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment Define the Graft versus Leukemia Response with Adoptive Cellular Therapy\nAuthors: Maurer, K.; Park, C.; Mani, S.; Borji, M.; Penter, L.; Jin, Y.; Zhang, J.

J.; Azizi, E.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579677\nUnderstanding how intra-tumoral immune populations coordinate to generate anti-tumor responses following therapy can guide precise treatment prioritization. We performed systematic dissection of an established adoptive cellular therapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), by analyzing 348,905 single-cell transcriptomes from 74 longitudinal bone-marrow samples of 25 patients with relapsed myeloid leukemia; a subset was evaluated by protein-based spatial analysis. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) responders, diverse immune cell types within the bone-marrow microenvironment (BME) were predicted to interact with a clonally expanded population of ZNF683+GZMB+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which demonstrated in vitro specificity for autologous leukemia. This population, originating predominantly from the DLI product, expanded concurrently with NK and B cells. AML nonresponder BME revealed a paucity of crosstalk and elevated TIGIT expression in CD8+ CTLs. Our study highlights recipient BME differences as a key determinant of effective anti-leukemia response and opens new opportunities to modulate cell-based leukemia-directed therapy.\nTension-induced adhesion mode switching: the interplay between focal adhesions and clathrin-containing adhesion complexes\nAuthors: Djakbarova, U.; Madraki, Y.; Chan, E.; Wu, T.; Atreaga-Muniz, V.; Akatay, A. A.; Kural, C.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579324\nIntegrin-based adhesion complexes are crucial in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and motility. While the dynamics of canonical focal adhesion complexes (FAs) have been extensively studied, the regulation and physiological implications of the recently identified clathrin-containing adhesion complexes (CCACs) are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal mechanoregulations of FAs and CCACs in a breast cancer model. Employing single-molecule force spectroscopy coupled with live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that FAs and CCACs are mutually exclusive and inversely regulated complexes. This regulation is orchestrated through the modulation of plasma membrane tension, in combination with distinct modes of actomyosin contractility that can either synergize with or counteract this modulation. Our findings indicate that increased membrane tension promotes the association of CCACs at integrin V{beta}5 adhesion sites, leading to decreased cancer cell proliferation, spreading, and migration. Conversely, lower membrane tension promotes the formation of FAs, which correlates with the softer membranes observed in cancer cells, thus potentially facilitating cancer progression. Our research provides novel insights into the biomechanical regulation of CCACs and FAs, revealing their critical and contrasting roles in modulating cancer cell progression.\nThe molecular basis of the anticancer effect of statins\nAuthors: Buccioli, G.; Testa, C.; Jacchetti, E.; Pinoli, P.; Carelli, S.; Ceri, S.; Raimondi, M. T.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578869\nStatins, one of the most used class of cardiovascular drugs with the primary function of reducing blood cholesterol levels, exert their effect by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the key player in cholesterol biosynthesis. While the primary indication for statins is the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, there has been growing interest in their potential anticancer effects. However, the current evidence on these effects is largely based on epidemiological observations and preclinical research, not yet substantiated by knowledge of the mechanisms behind it. Here we show that statins have an anticancer effect as they exploit the principle of Synthetic Lethality, a concept in which the combination of two non-lethal genetic or molecular events results in cell death or impairment. When either of these events occurs alone, it is not lethal, but when they happen coupled, they create a lethal condition for the cell. In this work we report that statins emerged from a computational data analysis that we performed on approximately 37,000 synthetic lethality couples. We performed this analysis to select repurposable drugs that could target genes involved in Synthetic Lethality couples with metastatic genes. We validated our discovery in vitro by drug tests performed on cell lines derived from cancers of the breast, ovary, and cervix. Our data-driven drug repurposing strategy allowed us to understand the molecular basis of the anticancer effect of statins, a discovery which can be directly translated into practical clinical applications in oncology.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency enhances sensitivity to DNA damaging agents commonly used to treat cancer. In HR-proficient cancers, metabolic mechanisms driving response or resistance to DNA damaging agents remain unclear. Here we identified that depletion of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG) sensitizes HR-proficient cells to DNA damaging agents by metabolic regulation of histone acetylation. KG is required for the activity of KG-dependent dioxygenases (KGDDs), and prior work has shown that changes in KGDD affect demethylases. Using a targeted CRISPR knockout library consisting of 64 KGDDs, we discovered that Trimethyllysine Hydroxylase Epsilon (TMLHE), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo carnitine synthesis, is necessary for proliferation of HR-proficient cells in the presence of DNA damaging agents. Unexpectedly, KG-mediated TMLHE-dependent carnitine synthesis was required for histone acetylation, while histone methylation was affected but dispensable. The increase in histone acetylation via KG-dependent carnitine synthesis promoted HR-mediated DNA repair through site- and substrate-specific histone acetylation. These data demonstrate for the first time that HR-proficiency is mediated through KG directly influencing histone acetylation via carnitine synthesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resolving the molecular mechanisms driving childhood brain tumors will uncover tumor-specific vulnerabilities and advance mechanism-of-action-based therapies. Here we describe a continuum of cell-states in Group 3/4 medulloblastomas, the most frequent and fatal cerebellar embryonal tumor subgroups, based on the differential activity of transcription-factor-driven gene networks derived using a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-omic medulloblastoma atlas. We show that Group 3/4 tumor diversity stems from enriched cell-states along four molecular identity axes: photoreceptor, MYC, precursor, and unipolar brush cell-like. We identified a potential role of PAX6 in driving dual Group 3- and Group 4-like tumor trajectories in subtype VII tumors. Our study demonstrates how oncogenic events together with lineage determinants drive Group 3/4 tumor identity away from their original source in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phenotype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes - proliferative versus invasive states. While it has long been hypothesised that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumor cells at the interface between the tumor and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of these rare cells showed flattened, elliptical nuclei suggestive of mechanical confinement by adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that the interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favor the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumor cells are less proliferative but more drug resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism driving phenotype switching in melanoma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of splicing dysregulation in cancer is underscored by splicing factor mutations; however, its impact in the absence of such rare mutations is poorly understood. To reveal complex patient subtypes and putative regulators of pathogenic splicing in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), we developed a new approach called OncoSplice. Among diverse new subtypes, OncoSplice identified a biphasic poor prognosis signature that partially phenocopies U2AF1-mutant splicing, impacting thousands of genes in over 40% of adult and pediatric AML cases. U2AF1-like splicing co-opted a healthy circadian splicing program, was stable over time and induced a leukemia stem cell (LSC) program. Pharmacological inhibition of the implicated U2AF1-like splicing regulator, PRMT5, rescued leukemia mis-splicing and inhibited leukemic cell growth. Genetic deletion of IRAK4, a common target of U2AF1-like and PRMT5 treated cells, blocked leukemia development in xenograft models and induced differentiation. These analyses reveal a new prognostic alternative-splicing mechanism in malignancy, independent of splicing-factor mutations.

Statement of significanceUsing a new in silico strategy we reveal counteracting determinants of patient survival in Acute Myeloid Leukemia that co-opt well-defined mutation-dependent splicing programs. Broad poor-prognosis splicing and leukemia stem cell survival could be rescued through pharmacological inhibition (PRMT5) or target deletion (IRAK4), opening the door for new precision therapies.

        <p class="abstract">Despite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of Group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in pediatric neuro-oncology. Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoral heterogeneity in Group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in the majority of cases, large-scale copy-number aberrations prevail. However, intratumoral heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad CNVs in tumor evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of Group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC, MYCN, and PRDM6. We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumor initiating events, while the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically sub-clonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumor development and therapy resistance. We identify that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumor tissue using spatial transcriptomics, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell-lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During liver fibrosis, recurrent hepatic injuries lead to accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix components in the interstitial space, ultimately disrupting liver functions. Early stages of liver fibrosis may be reversible, but opportunities for diagnosis at these stages are currently limited. Here, we show that the alterations of the interstitial space associated with fibrosis can be probed by tracking individual fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) diffusing in that space. In a mouse model of early liver fibrosis, we find that nanotubes generally explore elongated areas, whose length decrease as the disease progresses even in regions where histopathological examination does not reveal fibrosis yet. Furthermore, this decrease in nanotube mobility is a purely geometrical effect, as the instantaneous nanotube diffusivity stays unmodified. This work establishes the promise of SWCNTs both for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis at an early stage, and for more in-depth studies of the biophysical effects of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics have been reported in cancer cells. While post translational modifications are known regulators of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, we show that alternative splice variants of the fission protein Drp1 (DNM1L) have specific and unique roles in cancer, adding to the complexity of mitochondrial fission/fusion regulation in tumor cells. Ovarian cancer specimens express an alternative splice transcript variant of Drp1 lacking exon 16 of the variable domain, and high expression of this splice variant relative to other transcripts is associated with poor patient outcome. Unlike the full-length variant, expression of Drp1 lacking exon 16 leads to decreased association of Drp1 to mitochondrial fission sites, more fused mitochondrial networks, enhanced respiration, and TCA cycle metabolites, and is associated with a more metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These pro-tumorigenic effects can also be inhibited by specific siRNA-mediated inhibition of the endogenously expressed transcript lacking exon 16. Moreover, lack of exon 16 abrogates mitochondrial fission in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli and leads to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. These data emphasize the significance of the pathophysiological consequences of Drp1 alternative splicing and divergent functions of Drp1 splice variants, and strongly warrant consideration of Drp1 splicing in future studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how intra-tumoral immune populations coordinate to generate anti-tumor responses following therapy can guide precise treatment prioritization. We performed systematic dissection of an established adoptive cellular therapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), by analyzing 348,905 single-cell transcriptomes from 74 longitudinal bone-marrow samples of 25 patients with relapsed myeloid leukemia; a subset was evaluated by protein-based spatial analysis. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) responders, diverse immune cell types within the bone-marrow microenvironment (BME) were predicted to interact with a clonally expanded population of ZNF683&#43;GZMB&#43; CD8&#43; cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which demonstrated in vitro specificity for autologous leukemia. This population, originating predominantly from the DLI product, expanded concurrently with NK and B cells. AML nonresponder BME revealed a paucity of crosstalk and elevated TIGIT expression in CD8&#43; CTLs. Our study highlights recipient BME differences as a key determinant of effective anti-leukemia response and opens new opportunities to modulate cell-based leukemia-directed therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Integrin-based adhesion complexes are crucial in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and motility. While the dynamics of canonical focal adhesion complexes (FAs) have been extensively studied, the regulation and physiological implications of the recently identified clathrin-containing adhesion complexes (CCACs) are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal mechanoregulations of FAs and CCACs in a breast cancer model. Employing single-molecule force spectroscopy coupled with live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that FAs and CCACs are mutually exclusive and inversely regulated complexes. This regulation is orchestrated through the modulation of plasma membrane tension, in combination with distinct modes of actomyosin contractility that can either synergize with or counteract this modulation. Our findings indicate that increased membrane tension promotes the association of CCACs at integrin V{beta}5 adhesion sites, leading to decreased cancer cell proliferation, spreading, and migration. Conversely, lower membrane tension promotes the formation of FAs, which correlates with the softer membranes observed in cancer cells, thus potentially facilitating cancer progression. Our research provides novel insights into the biomechanical regulation of CCACs and FAs, revealing their critical and contrasting roles in modulating cancer cell progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Statins, one of the most used class of cardiovascular drugs with the primary function of reducing blood cholesterol levels, exert their effect by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the key player in cholesterol biosynthesis. While the primary indication for statins is the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, there has been growing interest in their potential anticancer effects. However, the current evidence on these effects is largely based on epidemiological observations and preclinical research, not yet substantiated by knowledge of the mechanisms behind it. Here we show that statins have an anticancer effect as they exploit the principle of Synthetic Lethality, a concept in which the combination of two non-lethal genetic or molecular events results in cell death or impairment. When either of these events occurs alone, it is not lethal, but when they happen coupled, they create a lethal condition for the cell. In this work we report that statins emerged from a computational data analysis that we performed on approximately 37,000 synthetic lethality couples. We performed this analysis to select repurposable drugs that could target genes involved in Synthetic Lethality couples with metastatic genes. We validated our discovery in vitro by drug tests performed on cell lines derived from cancers of the breast, ovary, and cervix. Our data-driven drug repurposing strategy allowed us to understand the molecular basis of the anticancer effect of statins, a discovery which can be directly translated into practical clinical applications in oncology.</p>
