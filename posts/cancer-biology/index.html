Classic etiological factors for head and neck tumors such as tobacco, alcohol, and human papillomavirus are not related to early-onset tongue cancer. Mechanisms of development and progression of this cancer remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatial whole-transcriptome profiling of tongue cancer in young adults compared with elderly patients. Oxidative stress, vascular mimicry, and MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways were enriched in early-onset tongue cancer. Tumor microenvironment demonstrated increased gene signatures corresponding to myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and plasma cells. The invasive front was accompanied by vascular mimicry with arrangement of tumor-associated macrophages and aggregations of plasma cells and lymphocytes organized into tertiary lymphoid structures. Taken together, these results indicate that early-onset tongue cancer has distinct spatial transcriptomic features and molecular mechanisms compared to older patients.

Y.; Aguirre, K.; Laveroni, O.; Kim, S.; Wang, A.; Liang, B.; Zhang, X.; Han, L. M.; Valbuena, R.; Plevritis, S. K.; Bassik, M. C.; Snyder, M. P.; Howitt, B. E.; Jerby, L.\nScore: 77.6, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562592\nImmune exclusion and evasion are central barriers to the success of immunotherapies and cell therapies in solid tumors. Here we applied single cell spatial and perturbational transcriptomics alongside clinical, histological, and genomic profiling to elucidate immune exclusion and evasion in high-grade serous tubo-ovarian cancer (HGSC). Using high-plex spatial transcriptomics we profiled more than 1.3 million cells from 95 tumors and 60 patients, revealing generalizable principles in HGSC tumor tissue organization. Our data demonstrates that effector T cells resist stroma-mediated trapping and sequestration. However, upon infiltration into the tumor, T cells, as well as Natural Killer (NK) cells, preferentially co-localize only with a subset of malignant cells that manifest a distinct transcriptional cell state. The latter consists of dozens of co-regulated genes and is repressed under various copy number alterations. Performing CRISPR Perturb-seq screens in ovarian cancer cells, we identified functionally diverse genetic perturbations - including knockout of the insulin sensing repressor PTPN1 and the epigenetic regulator ACTR8 - that de-repress the proposed immunogenic malignant cell state identified in patients and indeed sensitize ovarian cancer cells to T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, our study uncovered a profound connection between somatic genetic aberrations, malignant cell transcriptional dysregulation, and immune evasion at the cellular and tissue level, allowing us to identify targets that reprogram malignant cell states as an avenue to unleash anti-tumor immune responses.\nTumor-wide RNA splicing aberrations generate immunogenic public neoantigens\nAuthors: Kwok, D. W.; Stevers, N. O.; Nejo, T.; Chen, L. H.; Etxeberria, I.; Jung, J.; Okada, K.; Colton Cove, M.; Lakshmanachetty, S.; Gallus, M.; Barpanda, A.; Hong, C.; Chan, G. K. L.; Wu, S. H.; Ramos, E.; Yamamichi, A.; Liu, J. Y. Z.; Watchmaker, P.; Ogino, H.; Saijo, A.; Du, A.; Grishanina, N.; Woo, J.; Diaz, A.; Chang, S. M.; Phillips, J. J.; Wiita, A.; Klebanoff, C. A.; Costello, J. F.; Okada, H.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563178\nT-cell-mediated immunotherapies are limited by the extent to which cancer-specific antigens are homogenously expressed throughout a tumor. We reasoned that recurrent splicing aberrations in cancer represent a potential source of tumor-wide and public neoantigens, and to test this possibility, we developed a novel pipeline for identifying neojunctions expressed uniformly within a tumor across diverse cancer types. Our analyses revealed multiple neojunctions that recur across patients and either exhibited intratumor heterogeneity or, in some cases, were tumor-wide. We identified CD8+ T-cell clones specific for neoantigens derived from tumor-wide and conserved neojunctions in GNAS and RPL22, respectively. TCR-engineered CD8+ T-cells targeting these mutations conferred neoantigen-specific tumor cell eradication. Furthermore, we revealed that cancer-specific dysregulation in splicing factor expression leads to recurrent neojunction expression. Together, these data reveal that a subset of neojunctions are both intratumorally conserved and public, providing the molecular basis for novel T-cell-based immunotherapies that address intratumoral heterogeneity.\nThe genetic evolution of acral melanoma\nAuthors: Wang, M.; Fukushima, S.; Sheen, Y.-S.; Ramelyte, E.; Cruz Pacheco, N.; Shi, C.; Liu, S.; Banik, I.; Aquino, J. D.; Sangueza Acosta, M.; Levesque, M.; Dummer, R.; Liau, J.-Y.; Chu, C.-Y.; Shain, A. H.; Yeh, I.; Bastian, B. C.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562802\nAcral melanoma is an aggressive type of melanoma with unknown origins, arising on the sole, palm, or nail apparatus. It is the most common type of melanoma in individuals with dark skin and is notoriously challenging to treat. Our study examined exome sequencing data from 139 tissue samples, spanning different progression stages, collected from 37 patients. We found that 78.4% of the melanomas displayed one or more clustered copy number transitions with focal amplifications, recurring predominantly on chromosomes 5, 11, 12, and 22. These genomic \"hailstorms\" were typically shared across all progression stages within individual patients. Genetic alterations known to activate TERT also arose early. By contrast, mutations in the MAP- kinase pathway appeared later during progression, often leading to different tumor areas harboring non-overlapping driver mutations. We conclude that the evolutionary trajectories of acral melanomas substantially diverge from those of melanomas on sun-exposed skin, where MAP-kinase pathway activation initiates the neoplastic cascade followed by immortalization later. The punctuated formation of hailstorms, paired with early TERT activation, suggests a unique mutational mechanism underlying the origins of acral melanoma. Our findings highlight an essential role for telomerase, likely in re-stabilizing tumor genomes after hailstorms have initiated the tumors. The marked genetic heterogeneity, in particular of MAP-kinase pathway drivers, may partly explain the limited success of targeted and other therapies in treating this melanoma subtype.\nAndrogen blockade primes NLRP3 in macrophages to induce tumor phagocytosis\nAuthors: Chaudagar, K. K.; Srikrishnan, R.; Mei, S.; Hirz, T.; Hu, Y.-M.; Argulian, A.; Labadie, B.; Desai, K.; Grimaldo, S.; Kahramangil, D.; Nair, R.; D Souza, S.; Zhou, D.; Li, M.; Doughan, F.; Chen, R.; Shafran, J.; Loyd, M.; Xia, Z.; Sykes, D. B.; Moran, A. E.; Patnaik, A.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557996\nImmune-based therapies induce durable remissions in subsets of patients across multiple malignancies. However, there is limited efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), manifested by an enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2) tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression are critically needed in mCRPC. Here we discovered that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), an innate immune sensing protein, is highly expressed in TAM from metastatic PC patients treated with standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Importantly, ex vivo studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) blockade in TAM upregulates NLRP3 expression, but not inflammasome activity, and concurrent AR blockade/NLRP3 agonist (NLRP3a) treatment promotes cancer cell phagocytosis by immunosuppressive M2 TAM. In contrast, NLRP3a monotherapy was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in anti-tumor (M1) TAM, which exhibit high de novo NLRP3 expression. Critically, combinatorial treatment with ADT/NLRP3a in a murine model of advanced PC resulted in significant tumor control, with tumor clearance in 55% of mice via TAM phagocytosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate NLRP3 as an AR-regulated macrophage phagocytic checkpoint, inducibly expressed in TAM by ADT and activated by NLRP3a treatment, the combination resulting in TAM-mediated phagocytosis and tumor control.\nClinically relevant humanized mouse models of metastatic prostate cancer to evaluate cancer therapies\nAuthors: Kostlan, R. J.; Phoenix, J. T.; Budreika, A.; Ferrari, M. G.; Khurana, N.; Choi, J. E.; Juckette, K.; McCollum, B. L.; Moskal, R.; Qiao, Y.; Vander Griend, D. J.; Chinnaiyan, A. M.; Kregel, S.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562280\nThere is tremendous need for improved prostate cancer (PCa) models. The mouse prostate does not spontaneously form tumors and is anatomically and developmentally different from the human prostate. Engineered mouse models lack the heterogeneity of human cancer and rarely establish metastatic growth. Human xenografts represent an alternative but rely on an immunocompromised host. Accordingly, we generated PCa murine xenograft models with an intact human immune system (huNOG and huNOG-EXL mice) to test whether humanizing tumor-immune interactions would improve modeling of metastatic PCa and the impact of hormonal and immunotherapies. These mice maintain multiple human cell lineages, including functional human T-cells and myeloid cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, subcutaneous tumor size was not significantly altered across conditions; however, metastasis to secondary sites differed in castrate huNOG vs background-matched immunocompromised mice treated with enzalutamide (enza). VCaP xenograft tumors showed decreases in growth with enza and anti-Programed-Death-1 treatments in huNOG mice, and no effect was seen with treatment in NOG mice. Enza responses in huNOG and NOG mice were distinct and associated with increased T-cells within tumors of enza treated huNOG mice, and increased T-cell activation. In huNOG-EXL mice, which support human myeloid development, there was a strong population of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and Myeloid-Derived-Suppressor-Cells (MDSCs), and enza treatment showed no difference in metastasis. Results illustrate, to our knowledge, the first model of human PCa that metastasizes to clinically relevant locations, has an intact human immune system, responds appropriately to standard-of-care hormonal therapies, and can model both an immunosuppressive and checkpoint-inhibition responsive immune microenvironment.\nState-transition Modeling of Blood Transcriptome Predicts Disease Evolution and Treatment Response in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)\nAuthors: Frankhouser, D. E.; Rockne, R. C.; Uechi, L.; Zhao, D.; Branciamore, S.; O'Meally, D.; Izarriy, J.; Ghoda, L.; Ali, H.; Trent, J.; Forman, S.; Fu, Y.-H.; Kuo, Y.-H.; Zhang, B.; Marcucci, G.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561908\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is initiated and initially maintained solely by the fusion gene BCR-ABL, encoding a multifaceted chimeric kinase targeted in the clinic with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) TKIs are effective in inducing long-term remission, but are also frequently not curative. Thus, CML is an ideal system to test our hypothesis that transcriptome-based state-transition models accurately predict cancer evolution and treatment response. To test our hypothesis, we collected time-sequential blood samples from tetracycline-off (Tet-Off) BCR-ABL-inducible transgenic mice and wild-type controls. Using the time-series bulk RNA-seq analysis to capture a system-wide view of distinct disease states, we identified a single principal component that constructed a CML state-space with a three-well BCR-ABL leukemogenic potential landscape. The potential stable critical points defined observable disease states. Early states were characterized by anti-CML genes opposing leukemic transformation; late states were characterized by pro-CML genes. Genes with expression patterns shaped similarly to the potential landscape were identified as disease transition drivers. Re-introduction of tetracyclines to silence the BCR/ABL gene returned diseased mice transcriptomes to a stable state near to health, without reaching it, suggesting partly irreversible transformation changes. TKI treatment only reverted the diseased mice transcriptomes to an earlier disease state, without approaching health; disease relapse occurred soon after treatment completion. Using only the earliest time-point as initial conditions, our parametrized state-transition models accurately predicted both disease progression and treatment response, supporting this as a potentially valuable approach to time clinical intervention even before phenotypic changes become detectable.\nDefining metabolic flexibility in hair follicle stem cell induced squamous cell carcinoma\nAuthors: Galvan, C.; Flores, A.; Cerillos, V.; Avila, I.; Murphy, C.; Zheng, W.; To, T. T.; Christofk, H.; Lowry, W.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562128\nAmong the numerous changes associated with the transformation to cancer, cellular metabolism is one of the first discovered and most prominent[1, 2]. However, despite the knowledge that nearly every cancer is associated with the strong upregulation of various metabolic pathways, there has yet to be much clinical progress on the treatment of cancer by targeting a single metabolic enzyme directly[3-6]. We previously showed that inhibition of glycolysis through lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) deletion in cancer cells of origin had no effect on the initiation or progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma[7], suggesting that these cancers are metabolically flexible enough to produce the necessary metabolites required for sustained growth in the absence of glycolysis. Here we focused on glutaminolysis, another metabolic pathway frequently implicated as important for tumorigenesis in correlative studies. We genetically blocked glutaminolysis through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in cancer cells of origin, and found that this had little effect on tumorigenesis, similar to what we previously showed for blocking glycolysis. Tumors with genetic deletion of glutaminolysis instead upregulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We also found that the metabolic flexibility observed upon inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis is due to post-transcriptional changes in the levels of plasma membrane lactate and glutamine transporters. To define the limits of metabolic flexibility in cancer initiating hair follicle stem cells, we genetically blocked both glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously and found that frank carcinoma was not compatible with abrogation of both of these carbon utilization pathways. These data point towards metabolic flexibility mediated by regulation of nutrient consumption, and suggest that treatment of cancer through metabolic manipulation will require multiple interventions on distinct pathways.\nIncreased stromal densities of B cells, CD103+ cells, and CD163+ M2-like macrophages associate with poor clinical outcomes in BCG treated non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\nAuthors: Ravenscroft, B.; Yolmo, P.; Chenard, S.; Rahimi, S.; Pace, K.; Sachdeva, K.; Jamaspishvilli, T.; Ghadei, H.; Garven, A.; Tyryshkin, K.; Berman, D. M.; Jackson, C.; Siemens, D. R.; Koti, M.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.562817\nNon-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) constitutes a significant clinical challenge, with over 50% of patients experiencing poor clinical outcomes in the form of early recurrence or progression following treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. The pre-treatment tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is an established determinant of response to BCG. This study explores the spatial profiles of CD79a+ B cells, CD163+ M2-like macrophages, proliferating and tissue-resident phenotypes of T cells, along with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint expression in pre-BCG treatment tumors of 173 patients (139 males, 34 females). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining of a tumor tissue microarray, revealed elevated infiltration of CD79a+ B cells, CD163+ M2-like macrophages, CD103+ cells, and CD8+ T cells at the tumor invasive margins. Increased epithelial PD-L1 immune-checkpoint expression in tumors was observed in female and male patients who exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS). Importantly, high CD79a+ B cell density in BCG-treated females in both stromal and epithelial compartments exhibited significantly shorter RFS and progression-free survival compared to males. Stromal CD79a+ B cell density was positively correlated with M2-like macrophages, CD8+ T cells, CD103+ cells and PD-1 expressing cells. CD79a+ B cells, CD103+ cells, and M2-like macrophage density were associated with higher grade and enriched in basal subtype tumor. This study highlights the significance of an understudied role of B cells and their cellular neighborhoods in the pre-treatment TIME and BCG-therapy response. Overall, findings from this study underscore the importance of considering sex-related immunobiological differences in the stromal compartments of bladder tumors towards the development of optimal therapeutic targeting strategies.\nChildhood cancer mutagenesis caused by a domesticated DNA transposase\nAuthors: Keller, R.; Yamada, M.; Cameron, D.; Suzuki, H.; Sanghrajka, R.; Vaynshteyn, J.; Gerwin, J.; Maura, F.; Hooper, W.; Shah, M.; Robine, N.; Demarest, P.; Bayin, N.

G.; Kentsis, A.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.05.498128\nGenomic rearrangements are a hallmark of most solid tumors, including medulloblastoma, one of the most common brain tumors in children. Childhood cancers involve dysregulated cell development, but their mutational causes remain largely unknown. One of the most common forms of medulloblastoma is caused by ectopic activation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in cerebellar granule cell progenitors, associated with genetic deletions, amplifications, and other oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we show that PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5 (Pgbd5) promotes tumor development in multiple developmentally-accurate mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma. Most mice with Pgbd5 deficiency do not develop tumors, while Pgbd5-deficient mice maintain largely normal cerebellar development. Mouse medulloblastomas expressing Pgbd5 exhibit significantly increased numbers of somatic structural DNA rearrangements, with PGBD5-specific transposon sequences at their breakpoints. Similar sequence breakpoints recurrently affect somatic DNA rearrangements of known tumor suppressors and oncogenes in medulloblastomas in 329 children. Therefore, this study identifies PGBD5 as a primary medulloblastoma mutator and provides a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of somatic oncogenic DNA rearrangements in childhood cancer.

        <p class="abstract">Tongue cancer at a young age demonstrates an increase in incidence, aggressiveness, and poor response to therapy. Classic etiological factors for head and neck tumors such as tobacco, alcohol, and human papillomavirus are not related to early-onset tongue cancer. Mechanisms of development and progression of this cancer remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatial whole-transcriptome profiling of tongue cancer in young adults compared with elderly patients. Oxidative stress, vascular mimicry, and MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways were enriched in early-onset tongue cancer. Tumor microenvironment demonstrated increased gene signatures corresponding to myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and plasma cells. The invasive front was accompanied by vascular mimicry with arrangement of tumor-associated macrophages and aggregations of plasma cells and lymphocytes organized into tertiary lymphoid structures. Taken together, these results indicate that early-onset tongue cancer has distinct spatial transcriptomic features and molecular mechanisms compared to older patients.

        <p class="abstract">Immune exclusion and evasion are central barriers to the success of immunotherapies and cell therapies in solid tumors. Here we applied single cell spatial and perturbational transcriptomics alongside clinical, histological, and genomic profiling to elucidate immune exclusion and evasion in high-grade serous tubo-ovarian cancer (HGSC). Using high-plex spatial transcriptomics we profiled more than 1.3 million cells from 95 tumors and 60 patients, revealing generalizable principles in HGSC tumor tissue organization. Our data demonstrates that effector T cells resist stroma-mediated trapping and sequestration. However, upon infiltration into the tumor, T cells, as well as Natural Killer (NK) cells, preferentially co-localize only with a subset of malignant cells that manifest a distinct transcriptional cell state. The latter consists of dozens of co-regulated genes and is repressed under various copy number alterations. Performing CRISPR Perturb-seq screens in ovarian cancer cells, we identified functionally diverse genetic perturbations - including knockout of the insulin sensing repressor PTPN1 and the epigenetic regulator ACTR8 - that de-repress the proposed immunogenic malignant cell state identified in patients and indeed sensitize ovarian cancer cells to T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, our study uncovered a profound connection between somatic genetic aberrations, malignant cell transcriptional dysregulation, and immune evasion at the cellular and tissue level, allowing us to identify targets that reprogram malignant cell states as an avenue to unleash anti-tumor immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T-cell-mediated immunotherapies are limited by the extent to which cancer-specific antigens are homogenously expressed throughout a tumor. We reasoned that recurrent splicing aberrations in cancer represent a potential source of tumor-wide and public neoantigens, and to test this possibility, we developed a novel pipeline for identifying neojunctions expressed uniformly within a tumor across diverse cancer types. Our analyses revealed multiple neojunctions that recur across patients and either exhibited intratumor heterogeneity or, in some cases, were tumor-wide. We identified CD8&#43; T-cell clones specific for neoantigens derived from tumor-wide and conserved neojunctions in GNAS and RPL22, respectively. TCR-engineered CD8&#43; T-cells targeting these mutations conferred neoantigen-specific tumor cell eradication. Furthermore, we revealed that cancer-specific dysregulation in splicing factor expression leads to recurrent neojunction expression. Together, these data reveal that a subset of neojunctions are both intratumorally conserved and public, providing the molecular basis for novel T-cell-based immunotherapies that address intratumoral heterogeneity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acral melanoma is an aggressive type of melanoma with unknown origins, arising on the sole, palm, or nail apparatus. It is the most common type of melanoma in individuals with dark skin and is notoriously challenging to treat. Our study examined exome sequencing data from 139 tissue samples, spanning different progression stages, collected from 37 patients. We found that 78.4% of the melanomas displayed one or more clustered copy number transitions with focal amplifications, recurring predominantly on chromosomes 5, 11, 12, and 22. These genomic &#34;hailstorms&#34; were typically shared across all progression stages within individual patients. Genetic alterations known to activate TERT also arose early. By contrast, mutations in the MAP- kinase pathway appeared later during progression, often leading to different tumor areas harboring non-overlapping driver mutations. We conclude that the evolutionary trajectories of acral melanomas substantially diverge from those of melanomas on sun-exposed skin, where MAP-kinase pathway activation initiates the neoplastic cascade followed by immortalization later. The punctuated formation of hailstorms, paired with early TERT activation, suggests a unique mutational mechanism underlying the origins of acral melanoma. Our findings highlight an essential role for telomerase, likely in re-stabilizing tumor genomes after hailstorms have initiated the tumors. The marked genetic heterogeneity, in particular of MAP-kinase pathway drivers, may partly explain the limited success of targeted and other therapies in treating this melanoma subtype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune-based therapies induce durable remissions in subsets of patients across multiple malignancies. However, there is limited efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), manifested by an enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2) tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression are critically needed in mCRPC. Here we discovered that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), an innate immune sensing protein, is highly expressed in TAM from metastatic PC patients treated with standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Importantly, ex vivo studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) blockade in TAM upregulates NLRP3 expression, but not inflammasome activity, and concurrent AR blockade/NLRP3 agonist (NLRP3a) treatment promotes cancer cell phagocytosis by immunosuppressive M2 TAM. In contrast, NLRP3a monotherapy was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in anti-tumor (M1) TAM, which exhibit high de novo NLRP3 expression. Critically, combinatorial treatment with ADT/NLRP3a in a murine model of advanced PC resulted in significant tumor control, with tumor clearance in 55% of mice via TAM phagocytosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate NLRP3 as an AR-regulated macrophage phagocytic checkpoint, inducibly expressed in TAM by ADT and activated by NLRP3a treatment, the combination resulting in TAM-mediated phagocytosis and tumor control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is tremendous need for improved prostate cancer (PCa) models. The mouse prostate does not spontaneously form tumors and is anatomically and developmentally different from the human prostate. Engineered mouse models lack the heterogeneity of human cancer and rarely establish metastatic growth. Human xenografts represent an alternative but rely on an immunocompromised host. Accordingly, we generated PCa murine xenograft models with an intact human immune system (huNOG and huNOG-EXL mice) to test whether humanizing tumor-immune interactions would improve modeling of metastatic PCa and the impact of hormonal and immunotherapies. These mice maintain multiple human cell lineages, including functional human T-cells and myeloid cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, subcutaneous tumor size was not significantly altered across conditions; however, metastasis to secondary sites differed in castrate huNOG vs background-matched immunocompromised mice treated with enzalutamide (enza). VCaP xenograft tumors showed decreases in growth with enza and anti-Programed-Death-1 treatments in huNOG mice, and no effect was seen with treatment in NOG mice. Enza responses in huNOG and NOG mice were distinct and associated with increased T-cells within tumors of enza treated huNOG mice, and increased T-cell activation. In huNOG-EXL mice, which support human myeloid development, there was a strong population of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and Myeloid-Derived-Suppressor-Cells (MDSCs), and enza treatment showed no difference in metastasis. Results illustrate, to our knowledge, the first model of human PCa that metastasizes to clinically relevant locations, has an intact human immune system, responds appropriately to standard-of-care hormonal therapies, and can model both an immunosuppressive and checkpoint-inhibition responsive immune microenvironment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is initiated and initially maintained solely by the fusion gene BCR-ABL, encoding a multifaceted chimeric kinase targeted in the clinic with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) TKIs are effective in inducing long-term remission, but are also frequently not curative. Thus, CML is an ideal system to test our hypothesis that transcriptome-based state-transition models accurately predict cancer evolution and treatment response. To test our hypothesis, we collected time-sequential blood samples from tetracycline-off (Tet-Off) BCR-ABL-inducible transgenic mice and wild-type controls. Using the time-series bulk RNA-seq analysis to capture a system-wide view of distinct disease states, we identified a single principal component that constructed a CML state-space with a three-well BCR-ABL leukemogenic potential landscape. The potential stable critical points defined observable disease states. Early states were characterized by anti-CML genes opposing leukemic transformation; late states were characterized by pro-CML genes. Genes with expression patterns shaped similarly to the potential landscape were identified as disease transition drivers. Re-introduction of tetracyclines to silence the BCR/ABL gene returned diseased mice transcriptomes to a stable state near to health, without reaching it, suggesting partly irreversible transformation changes. TKI treatment only reverted the diseased mice transcriptomes to an earlier disease state, without approaching health; disease relapse occurred soon after treatment completion. Using only the earliest time-point as initial conditions, our parametrized state-transition models accurately predicted both disease progression and treatment response, supporting this as a potentially valuable approach to time clinical intervention even before phenotypic changes become detectable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Among the numerous changes associated with the transformation to cancer, cellular metabolism is one of the first discovered and most prominent[1, 2]. However, despite the knowledge that nearly every cancer is associated with the strong upregulation of various metabolic pathways, there has yet to be much clinical progress on the treatment of cancer by targeting a single metabolic enzyme directly[3-6]. We previously showed that inhibition of glycolysis through lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) deletion in cancer cells of origin had no effect on the initiation or progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma[7], suggesting that these cancers are metabolically flexible enough to produce the necessary metabolites required for sustained growth in the absence of glycolysis. Here we focused on glutaminolysis, another metabolic pathway frequently implicated as important for tumorigenesis in correlative studies. We genetically blocked glutaminolysis through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in cancer cells of origin, and found that this had little effect on tumorigenesis, similar to what we previously showed for blocking glycolysis. Tumors with genetic deletion of glutaminolysis instead upregulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We also found that the metabolic flexibility observed upon inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis is due to post-transcriptional changes in the levels of plasma membrane lactate and glutamine transporters. To define the limits of metabolic flexibility in cancer initiating hair follicle stem cells, we genetically blocked both glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously and found that frank carcinoma was not compatible with abrogation of both of these carbon utilization pathways. These data point towards metabolic flexibility mediated by regulation of nutrient consumption, and suggest that treatment of cancer through metabolic manipulation will require multiple interventions on distinct pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) constitutes a significant clinical challenge, with over 50% of patients experiencing poor clinical outcomes in the form of early recurrence or progression following treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. The pre-treatment tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is an established determinant of response to BCG. This study explores the spatial profiles of CD79a&#43; B cells, CD163&#43; M2-like macrophages, proliferating and tissue-resident phenotypes of T cells, along with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint expression in pre-BCG treatment tumors of 173 patients (139 males, 34 females). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining of a tumor tissue microarray, revealed elevated infiltration of CD79a&#43; B cells, CD163&#43; M2-like macrophages, CD103&#43; cells, and CD8&#43; T cells at the tumor invasive margins. Increased epithelial PD-L1 immune-checkpoint expression in tumors was observed in female and male patients who exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS). Importantly, high CD79a&#43; B cell density in BCG-treated females in both stromal and epithelial compartments exhibited significantly shorter RFS and progression-free survival compared to males. Stromal CD79a&#43; B cell density was positively correlated with M2-like macrophages, CD8&#43; T cells, CD103&#43; cells and PD-1 expressing cells. CD79a&#43; B cells, CD103&#43; cells, and M2-like macrophage density were associated with higher grade and enriched in basal subtype tumor. This study highlights the significance of an understudied role of B cells and their cellular neighborhoods in the pre-treatment TIME and BCG-therapy response. Overall, findings from this study underscore the importance of considering sex-related immunobiological differences in the stromal compartments of bladder tumors towards the development of optimal therapeutic targeting strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of most solid tumors, including medulloblastoma, one of the most common brain tumors in children. Childhood cancers involve dysregulated cell development, but their mutational causes remain largely unknown. One of the most common forms of medulloblastoma is caused by ectopic activation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in cerebellar granule cell progenitors, associated with genetic deletions, amplifications, and other oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we show that PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5 (Pgbd5) promotes tumor development in multiple developmentally-accurate mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma. Most mice with Pgbd5 deficiency do not develop tumors, while Pgbd5-deficient mice maintain largely normal cerebellar development. Mouse medulloblastomas expressing Pgbd5 exhibit significantly increased numbers of somatic structural DNA rearrangements, with PGBD5-specific transposon sequences at their breakpoints. Similar sequence breakpoints recurrently affect somatic DNA rearrangements of known tumor suppressors and oncogenes in medulloblastomas in 329 children. Therefore, this study identifies PGBD5 as a primary medulloblastoma mutator and provides a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of somatic oncogenic DNA rearrangements in childhood cancer.
