These methods often profile extremely limited spatial regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the 3D microanatomy of surgically resected human pancreas biospecimens obtained from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. To compare differences in the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, we assessed the bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition of a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs), and a cohort of 3D serially sectioned and reconstructed tissues of pancreata. Here, we show the strength of using 3D as the gold standard, by measuring the information loss and sampling problems when using WSIs and TMAs. We demonstrate that spatial correlation in microanatomical tissue content decays significantly within a span of just a few microns within tumors. As a corollary, hundreds of TMAs and tens of WSIs are required to estimate spatial bulk tumor composition with \u003c10% error in any given pancreatic tumor. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tumor burden and tissue composition. These preliminary results show the importance of rate of sampling necessary to more reliably assess spatially resolved tissue composition.\nMembrane to cortex attachment determines different mechanical phenotypes in LGR5+ and LGR5- colorectal cancer cells\nAuthors: Conti, S.; Venturini, V.; Canellas-Socias, A.; Cortina, C.; Abenza, J. F.; Attolini, C. S.-O.; Guerra, E. M.; Xu, C. K.; Li, J. H.; Rossetti, L.; Stassi, G.; Roca-Cusachs, P.; Diz-Munoz, A.; Ruprecht, V.; Guck, J.; Batlle, E.; Labernadie, A.; Trepat, X.\nScore: 29.3, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569244\nColorectal cancer tumors are composed of heterogeneous and plastic cell populations, including a pool of cancer stem cells that express LGR5. Whether these distinct cell populations display different mechanical properties, and how these properties might contribute to metastasis is unknown. Using CRC patient derived organoids (PDOs), we found that compared to LGR5- cells, LGR5+ cancer stem cells are stiffer, adhere better to the extracellular matrix (ECM), move slower both as single cells and clusters, display higher nuclear YAP, show a higher survival rate in response to mechanical confinement, and form larger transendothelial gaps. These differences are largely explained by the downregulation of the membrane to cortex attachment proteins Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERMs) in the LGR5+ cells. By analyzing scRNA-seq expression patterns from a patient cohort, we show that this downregulation is a robust signature of colorectal tumors. Our results show that LGR5- cells display a mechanically dynamic phenotype suitable for dissemination from the primary tumor whereas LGR5+ cells display a mechanically stable and resilient phenotype suitable for extravasation and metastatic growth.\nTumor-selective effects of active RAS inhibition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\nAuthors: Wasko, U.

However, the impact of inhibiting RAS functions in normal tissues is not known. RMC-7977 is a highly selective inhibitor of the active (GTP-bound) forms of KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS, with affinity for both mutant and wild type (WT) variants. As \u003e90% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases are driven by activating mutations in KRAS, we assessed the therapeutic potential of RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models, including human and murine cell lines, human patient-derived organoids, human PDAC explants, subcutaneous and orthotopic cell-line or patient derived xenografts, syngeneic allografts, and genetically engineered mouse models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumor activity across these models following direct RAS inhibition at doses and concentrations that were well-tolerated in vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumor versus normal tissues. Treated tumors exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis. Together, these data establish a strong preclinical rationale for the use of broad-spectrum RAS inhibition in the setting of PDAC.\nSpecific cPRC1 complexes are co-opted to mediate oncogenic gene repression in diffuse midline glioma\nAuthors: Gannon, D.; Lagan, E.; Silva, A.

J.; Soto-Feliciano, Y.; Vermeulen, M.; Oliviero, G.; Chen, C. W.; Phillips, R.; Bracken, A. P.; Brien, G.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.02.569451\nDiffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a fatal childhood brain tumour characterised primarily by mutant histone H3 (H3K27M). H3K27M causes a global reduction in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 by inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity. Paradoxically, PRC2 is essential in DMG tumour cells where residual complex activity is required for oncogenic gene repression, although the molecular mechanisms acting downstream of PRC2 in this context are poorly understood. Here, weve discovered this oncogenic gene repression is mediated by specific canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) formations. By combining CRISPR screening, biochemical and chromatin mapping approaches with functional perturbations we show that cPRC1 complexes containing CBX4 and PCGF4 drive oncogenic gene repression downstream of H3K27me3 in DMG cells. Remarkably, the altered H3K27me3 modification landscape characteristic of these tumours rewires the distribution of cPRC1 complexes on chromatin. CBX4 and PCGF4 containing cPRC1 accumulate at sites of H3K27me3 while other cPRC1 formations are displaced. Despite accounting for \u003c5% of cPRC1 complexes in DMG, CBX4/PCGF4-containing complexes predominate as gene repressors. Our findings link the altered distribution of H3K27me3 with imbalanced cPRC1 function, promoting oncogenic gene repression in DMG cells, revealing new disease mechanisms and highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities in this incurable childhood brain tumour.\nModelling glioblastoma resistance to temozolomide. Combination of spheroid and mathematical models to simulate cellular adaptation in vitro.\nAuthors: Perez-Aliacar, M.; Ayensa-Jimenez, J.; Randelovic, T.; Ochoa, I.; Doblare, M.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568421\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in the fight against cancer. In particular, in the case of glioblastoma, the most lethal brain tumour, resistance to temozolomide (the standard of care drug for chemotherapy in this tumour), is one of the main reasons behind treatment failure and hence responsible for the poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with this disease. In this paper, we combine the power of three-dimensional in vitro experiments of treated glioblastoma spheroids with mathematical models of tumour evolution and adaptation. We use a novel approach based on internal variables for modelling the acquisition of resistance to temozolomide that is observed in a group of treated spheroids in the experiments. These internal variables describe the cells phenotypic state, which depends on the history of drug exposure and affects cell behaviour. We use model selection to determine the most parsimonious model and calibrate it to reproduce the experimental data, obtaining a high level of agreement between the in vitro and in silico outcomes. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of each model parameter in the predictions. More importantly, we show the utility of our model for answering biological questions, such as what is the intrinsic adaptation mechanism, or for separating the sensitive and resistant populations. We conclude that the proposed in silico framework, in combination with experiments, can be useful to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance in glioblastoma and to eventually set some guidelines for the design of new treatment schemes.\nPreventing evolutionary rescue in cancer\nAuthors: Patil, S.; Viossat, Y.; Noble, R. J.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568336\nExtinction therapy aims to eradicate tumours by optimally scheduling multiple treatment strikes to exploit the vulnerability of small cell populations to stochastic extinction. This concept was recently shown to be theoretically sound but has not been subjected to thorough mathematical analysis. Here we obtain quantitative estimates of tumour extinction probabilities using a deterministic analytical model and a stochastic simulation model of two-strike extinction therapy, based on evolutionary rescue theory. We find that the optimal time for the second strike is when the tumour is close to its minimum size before relapse. Given that this exact time point may be difficult to determine in practice, we show that striking slightly after the relapse has begun is typically better than switching too early. We further reveal and explain how demographic and environmental parameters influence the treatment outcome. Surprisingly, a low dose in the first strike paired with a high dose in the second is shown to be optimal. As one of the first investigations of extinction therapy, our work establishes a foundation for further theoretical and experimental studies of this promising evolutionarily-informed cancer treatment strategy.\nOvercoming clinical resistance to EZH2 inhibition using rational epigenetic combination therapy\nAuthors: Kazansky, Y.; Cameron, D.; Mueller, H. S.; Demarest, P.; Zaffaroni, N.; Arrighetti, N.; Zuco, V.; Kuwahara, Y.; Somwar, R.; Ladanyi, M.; Qu, R.; De Stanchina, E.; Dela Cruz, F. S.; Kung, A. L.; Gounder, M.; Kentsis, A.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.06.527192\nEssential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on the functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general, and tazemetostat in particular, remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we sought to define molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas and rhabdoid tumors. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis and decouple EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition, and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. This also enables us to develop combination strategies to circumvent tazemetostat resistance using cell cycle bypass targeting via AURKB, and synthetic lethal targeting of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage repair via ATR. This reveals prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification, including PRICKLE1 associated with tazemetostat resistance. In all, this work offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials for epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and other epigenetically dysregulated cancers. SignificanceGenomic studies of patient epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and their cell lines identify mutations converging on a common pathway that is essential for response to EZH2 inhibition. Resistance mutations decouple drug-induced differentiation from cell cycle control. We identify complementary epigenetic combination strategies to overcome resistance and improve durability of response, supporting their investigation in clinical trials.\nProstate cancer-induced endothelial-to-osteoblast transition generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment\nAuthors: Lin, S.-H.; yu, g.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569496\nImmune checkpoint therapy has limited efficacy for patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC). In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that may account for the relative resistance of bmCRPC to immune checkpoint therapy. We found that prostate cancer (PCa)-induced bone via endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition causes an ingress of M2-like macrophages, leading to an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Analysis of a bmCRPC RNA-seq dataset revealed shorter overall survival in patients with an M2-high versus M2-low signature. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed CD206+ M2-like macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastasis. In osteogenic PCa xenografts, CD206+ macrophages were enriched adjacent to tumor-induced bone. FACS analysis showed an increase in CD206+ cells in osteogenic tumors compared to non-osteogenic tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the EC-to-OSB transition reduced aberrant bone and M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. RNAseq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from osteogenic (bone-TAMs) versus non-osteogenic (ctrl-TAMs) tumors showed high expression of an M2-like gene signature, canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and a decrease in an M1-like gene signature. Isolated bone-TAMs suppressed T-cell proliferation while ctrl-TAMs did not. Mechanistically, EC-OSB hybrid cells produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14 and LOX, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to bone-TME. Our study thus links the unique EC-to-OSB transition as an \"upstream\" event that drives \"downstream\" immunosuppression in the bone-TME. These studies suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit PCa-induced EC-to-OSB transition may reverse immunosuppression to promote immunotherapeutic outcomes in bmCRPC. SignificanceThe insight that prostate cancer-induced bone generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment offers a strategy to improve responses to immunotherapy approaches in patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\nThe spatial landscape of Cancer Hallmarks reveals patterns of tumor ecology\nAuthors: Sibai, M.; Cervilla, S.; Grases, D.; Musulen, E.; Lazcano, R.; Mo, C.-K.; Davalos, V.; Fortian, A.; Romeo, M.; Bernat, A.; Tokheim, C.; Grande, E.; Real, F.; Barretina, J.; Lazar, A.; Ding, L.; Esteller, M.; Bailey, M.; Porta-Pardo, E.\nScore: 49.1, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2022.06.18.496114\nTumors are complex ecosystems with dozens of interacting cell types. The concept of Cancer Hallmarks distills this complexity into a set of underlying principles that govern tumor growth. Here, we exploit this abstraction to explore the physical distribution of Cancer Hallmarks across 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. We show that Hallmark activity is spatially organized-with 7 out of 13 Hallmarks consistently more active in cancer cells than within the non-cancerous tumor microenvironment (TME). The opposite is true for the remaining six Hallmarks. Additionally, we discovered that genomic distance between tumor subclones correlates with differences in Cancer Hallmark activity, even leading to clone-Hallmark specialization in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate interdependent relationships between Cancer Hallmarks at the junctions of TME and cancer compartments. In conclusion, including the spatial dimension, particularly through the lens of Cancer Hallmarks, can improve our understanding of tumor ecology. SignificanceWe explored Cancer Hallmarks in 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. This study unveiled spatial patterns in Hallmark activity, with some being more active in cancer cells and others in the non-cancerous tumor environment. Genomic distance impacted Hallmark activity, and we identified interdependencies at the TME-cancer junctions, improving our understanding of tumor ecology.\nIntratumoral Delivery of Chlorine Dioxide Exploits its ROS-like Properties: A Novel Paradigm for Effective Cancer Therapy\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Liu, Z.; Liu, X.; Liu, S.; Zhang, J.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568512\nReactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are potent oxidizing compounds renowned for their ability to eradicate cancer cells and facilitate tissue regeneration. In our research, we have discovered chlorine dioxide (CD), a substance that exhibits ROS-like properties and can be safely administered as a medicinal agent in the human body. Our study focuses on the utilization of intratumoral delivery of CD as a novel and efficacious approach for cancer therapy. Through intratumoral injections, CD selectively targets and eliminates cancer cells without promoting drug resistance. Furthermore, CD has demonstrated the capacity to elicit an immune response against cancer, thereby augmenting its therapeutic potential. We propose a groundbreaking paradigm for cancer treatment, employing intratumoral injections of CD, which holds great promise in prolonging the survival of cancer patients and transforming cancer into a manageable chronic condition. This approach harnesses the ROS-like properties of CD to effectively eradicate cancer cells while fostering tissue regeneration. By capitalizing on the unique characteristics of CD, we present a new avenue for enhancing patient outcomes in cancer therapy. Further research is warranted to optimize the administration protocols and dosage of CD, as well as to explore potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents. With ongoing investigation, the intratumoral delivery of CD represents a promising and innovative strategy for achieving effective cancer therapy.

        <p class="abstract">Methods for partially resolved cellular profiling has enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping via thinly cut sections to study inter-patient and intra-patient differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited spatial regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the 3D microanatomy of surgically resected human pancreas biospecimens obtained from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. To compare differences in the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, we assessed the bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition of a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs), and a cohort of 3D serially sectioned and reconstructed tissues of pancreata. Here, we show the strength of using 3D as the gold standard, by measuring the information loss and sampling problems when using WSIs and TMAs. We demonstrate that spatial correlation in microanatomical tissue content decays significantly within a span of just a few microns within tumors. As a corollary, hundreds of TMAs and tens of WSIs are required to estimate spatial bulk tumor composition with &lt;10% error in any given pancreatic tumor. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tumor burden and tissue composition. These preliminary results show the importance of rate of sampling necessary to more reliably assess spatially resolved tissue composition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Colorectal cancer tumors are composed of heterogeneous and plastic cell populations, including a pool of cancer stem cells that express LGR5. Whether these distinct cell populations display different mechanical properties, and how these properties might contribute to metastasis is unknown. Using CRC patient derived organoids (PDOs), we found that compared to LGR5- cells, LGR5&#43; cancer stem cells are stiffer, adhere better to the extracellular matrix (ECM), move slower both as single cells and clusters, display higher nuclear YAP, show a higher survival rate in response to mechanical confinement, and form larger transendothelial gaps. These differences are largely explained by the downregulation of the membrane to cortex attachment proteins Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERMs) in the LGR5&#43; cells. By analyzing scRNA-seq expression patterns from a patient cohort, we show that this downregulation is a robust signature of colorectal tumors. Our results show that LGR5- cells display a mechanically dynamic phenotype suitable for dissemination from the primary tumor whereas LGR5&#43; cells display a mechanically stable and resilient phenotype suitable for extravasation and metastatic growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Broad-spectrum RAS inhibition holds the potential to benefit roughly a quarter of human cancer patients whose tumors are driven by RAS mutations. However, the impact of inhibiting RAS functions in normal tissues is not known. RMC-7977 is a highly selective inhibitor of the active (GTP-bound) forms of KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS, with affinity for both mutant and wild type (WT) variants. As &gt;90% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases are driven by activating mutations in KRAS, we assessed the therapeutic potential of RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models, including human and murine cell lines, human patient-derived organoids, human PDAC explants, subcutaneous and orthotopic cell-line or patient derived xenografts, syngeneic allografts, and genetically engineered mouse models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumor activity across these models following direct RAS inhibition at doses and concentrations that were well-tolerated in vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumor versus normal tissues. Treated tumors exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis. Together, these data establish a strong preclinical rationale for the use of broad-spectrum RAS inhibition in the setting of PDAC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a fatal childhood brain tumour characterised primarily by mutant histone H3 (H3K27M). H3K27M causes a global reduction in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 by inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity. Paradoxically, PRC2 is essential in DMG tumour cells where residual complex activity is required for oncogenic gene repression, although the molecular mechanisms acting downstream of PRC2 in this context are poorly understood. Here, weve discovered this oncogenic gene repression is mediated by specific canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) formations. By combining CRISPR screening, biochemical and chromatin mapping approaches with functional perturbations we show that cPRC1 complexes containing CBX4 and PCGF4 drive oncogenic gene repression downstream of H3K27me3 in DMG cells. Remarkably, the altered H3K27me3 modification landscape characteristic of these tumours rewires the distribution of cPRC1 complexes on chromatin. CBX4 and PCGF4 containing cPRC1 accumulate at sites of H3K27me3 while other cPRC1 formations are displaced. Despite accounting for &lt;5% of cPRC1 complexes in DMG, CBX4/PCGF4-containing complexes predominate as gene repressors. Our findings link the altered distribution of H3K27me3 with imbalanced cPRC1 function, promoting oncogenic gene repression in DMG cells, revealing new disease mechanisms and highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities in this incurable childhood brain tumour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in the fight against cancer. In particular, in the case of glioblastoma, the most lethal brain tumour, resistance to temozolomide (the standard of care drug for chemotherapy in this tumour), is one of the main reasons behind treatment failure and hence responsible for the poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with this disease.

In this paper, we combine the power of three-dimensional in vitro experiments of treated glioblastoma spheroids with mathematical models of tumour evolution and adaptation. We use a novel approach based on internal variables for modelling the acquisition of resistance to temozolomide that is observed in a group of treated spheroids in the experiments. These internal variables describe the cells phenotypic state, which depends on the history of drug exposure and affects cell behaviour. We use model selection to determine the most parsimonious model and calibrate it to reproduce the experimental data, obtaining a high level of agreement between the in vitro and in silico outcomes. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of each model parameter in the predictions. More importantly, we show the utility of our model for answering biological questions, such as what is the intrinsic adaptation mechanism, or for separating the sensitive and resistant populations. We conclude that the proposed in silico framework, in combination with experiments, can be useful to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance in glioblastoma and to eventually set some guidelines for the design of new treatment schemes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extinction therapy aims to eradicate tumours by optimally scheduling multiple treatment strikes to exploit the vulnerability of small cell populations to stochastic extinction. This concept was recently shown to be theoretically sound but has not been subjected to thorough mathematical analysis. Here we obtain quantitative estimates of tumour extinction probabilities using a deterministic analytical model and a stochastic simulation model of two-strike extinction therapy, based on evolutionary rescue theory. We find that the optimal time for the second strike is when the tumour is close to its minimum size before relapse. Given that this exact time point may be difficult to determine in practice, we show that striking slightly after the relapse has begun is typically better than switching too early. We further reveal and explain how demographic and environmental parameters influence the treatment outcome. Surprisingly, a low dose in the first strike paired with a high dose in the second is shown to be optimal. As one of the first investigations of extinction therapy, our work establishes a foundation for further theoretical and experimental studies of this promising evolutionarily-informed cancer treatment strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Essential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on the functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general, and tazemetostat in particular, remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we sought to define molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas and rhabdoid tumors. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis and decouple EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition, and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. This also enables us to develop combination strategies to circumvent tazemetostat resistance using cell cycle bypass targeting via AURKB, and synthetic lethal targeting of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage repair via ATR. This reveals prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification, including PRICKLE1 associated with tazemetostat resistance. In all, this work offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials for epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and other epigenetically dysregulated cancers.

SignificanceGenomic studies of patient epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and their cell lines identify mutations converging on a common pathway that is essential for response to EZH2 inhibition. Resistance mutations decouple drug-induced differentiation from cell cycle control. We identify complementary epigenetic combination strategies to overcome resistance and improve durability of response, supporting their investigation in clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune checkpoint therapy has limited efficacy for patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC). In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that may account for the relative resistance of bmCRPC to immune checkpoint therapy. We found that prostate cancer (PCa)-induced bone via endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition causes an ingress of M2-like macrophages, leading to an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Analysis of a bmCRPC RNA-seq dataset revealed shorter overall survival in patients with an M2-high versus M2-low signature. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed CD206&#43; M2-like macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastasis. In osteogenic PCa xenografts, CD206&#43; macrophages were enriched adjacent to tumor-induced bone. FACS analysis showed an increase in CD206&#43; cells in osteogenic tumors compared to non-osteogenic tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the EC-to-OSB transition reduced aberrant bone and M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. RNAseq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from osteogenic (bone-TAMs) versus non-osteogenic (ctrl-TAMs) tumors showed high expression of an M2-like gene signature, canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and a decrease in an M1-like gene signature. Isolated bone-TAMs suppressed T-cell proliferation while ctrl-TAMs did not. Mechanistically, EC-OSB hybrid cells produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14 and LOX, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to bone-TME. Our study thus links the unique EC-to-OSB transition as an &#34;upstream&#34; event that drives &#34;downstream&#34; immunosuppression in the bone-TME. These studies suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit PCa-induced EC-to-OSB transition may reverse immunosuppression to promote immunotherapeutic outcomes in bmCRPC.

SignificanceThe insight that prostate cancer-induced bone generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment offers a strategy to improve responses to immunotherapy approaches in patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumors are complex ecosystems with dozens of interacting cell types. The concept of Cancer Hallmarks distills this complexity into a set of underlying principles that govern tumor growth. Here, we exploit this abstraction to explore the physical distribution of Cancer Hallmarks across 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. We show that Hallmark activity is spatially organized-with 7 out of 13 Hallmarks consistently more active in cancer cells than within the non-cancerous tumor microenvironment (TME). The opposite is true for the remaining six Hallmarks. Additionally, we discovered that genomic distance between tumor subclones correlates with differences in Cancer Hallmark activity, even leading to clone-Hallmark specialization in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate interdependent relationships between Cancer Hallmarks at the junctions of TME and cancer compartments. In conclusion, including the spatial dimension, particularly through the lens of Cancer Hallmarks, can improve our understanding of tumor ecology.

SignificanceWe explored Cancer Hallmarks in 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. This study unveiled spatial patterns in Hallmark activity, with some being more active in cancer cells and others in the non-cancerous tumor environment. Genomic distance impacted Hallmark activity, and we identified interdependencies at the TME-cancer junctions, improving our understanding of tumor ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are potent oxidizing compounds renowned for their ability to eradicate cancer cells and facilitate tissue regeneration. In our research, we have discovered chlorine dioxide (CD), a substance that exhibits ROS-like properties and can be safely administered as a medicinal agent in the human body. Our study focuses on the utilization of intratumoral delivery of CD as a novel and efficacious approach for cancer therapy. Through intratumoral injections, CD selectively targets and eliminates cancer cells without promoting drug resistance. Furthermore, CD has demonstrated the capacity to elicit an immune response against cancer, thereby augmenting its therapeutic potential. We propose a groundbreaking paradigm for cancer treatment, employing intratumoral injections of CD, which holds great promise in prolonging the survival of cancer patients and transforming cancer into a manageable chronic condition. This approach harnesses the ROS-like properties of CD to effectively eradicate cancer cells while fostering tissue regeneration. By capitalizing on the unique characteristics of CD, we present a new avenue for enhancing patient outcomes in cancer therapy. Further research is warranted to optimize the administration protocols and dosage of CD, as well as to explore potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents. With ongoing investigation, the intratumoral delivery of CD represents a promising and innovative strategy for achieving effective cancer therapy.
