R.; Mazutis, L.; D'Angelica, M.; Shia, J.; Garcia-Aguilar, J.; Nawy, T.; Hollman, T.; Chaligne, R.; Sanchez-Vega, F.; Sharma, R.; Pe'er, D.; Ganesh, K.\nScore: 56.1, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553925\nMetastasis is the principal cause of cancer death, yet we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states, their relationship to primary tumor states, and the mechanisms by which they transition. In a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that while primary tumors largely adopt LGR5+ intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Loss of intestinal cell states is accompanied by reprogramming into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state, followed by non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, which is exacerbated by chemotherapy and associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cancer cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues than their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumor counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a stabilizer of intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, whose downregulation licenses non-canonical reprogramming.\nMajor data analysis errors invalidate cancer microbiome findings\nAuthors: Gihawi, A.; Ge, Y.; Lu, J.; Puiu, D.; Xu, A.; Cooper, C. S.; Brewer, D. S.; Pertea, M.; Salzberg, S.\nScore: 669.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550993\nWe re-analyzed the data from a recent large-scale study that reported strong correlations between microbial organisms and 33 different cancer types, and that created machine learning predictors with near-perfect accuracy at distinguishing among cancers. We found at least two fundamental flaws in the reported data and in the methods: (1) errors in the genome database and the associated computational methods led to millions of false positive findings of bacterial reads across all samples, largely because most of the sequences identified as bacteria were instead human; and (2) errors in transformation of the raw data created an artificial signature, even for microbes with no reads detected, tagging each tumor type with a distinct signal that the machine learning programs then used to create an apparently accurate classifier. Each of these problems invalidates the results, leading to the conclusion that the microbiome-based classifiers for identifying cancer presented in the study are entirely wrong. These flaws have subsequently affected more than a dozen additional published studies that used the same data and whose results are likely invalid as well.\nMorphometry and mechanical instability at the onset of epithelial bladder cancer\nAuthors: Lampart, F. L.; Vetter, R.; Wang, Y.; Yamauchi, K. A.; Strohmeyer, N.; Meer, F.; Hussherr, M.-D.; Camenisch, G.; Seifert, H.-H.; Rentsch, C. A.; Le Magnen, C.; Mueller, D. J.; Bubendorf, L.; Iber, D.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553533\nMalignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for the majority of cancer cases. Much cancer research has focused on genetic alterations and their relation to different carcinoma phenotypes. Besides a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here, we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer, and propose that they emerge from a mechanical buckling instability upon epithelial overgrowth. Using a combination of microscopy imaging of the mouse and human bladder tissue, elasticity theory, and numerical simulations of differential growth in the bladder mucosa, we find that aberrant tissue morphologies can emerge through stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds exhibit qualitative and quantitative similarity with imaged early papillary tumors and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy indeed reveals local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a mechanical origin of the different carcinoma subtypes in the bladder, which have vastly different clinical prognosis. They might provide the basis for a new line of attack in medical carcinoma treatment and prophylaxis.\nCell-specific crosstalk proteomics reveals cathepsin B signaling as a driver of glioblastoma malignancy near the subventricular zone\nAuthors: Norton, E. S.; Whaley, L. A.; Jones, V. K.; Brooks, M. M.; Russo, M. N.; Morderer, D.; Jessen, E.; Schiapparelli, P.; Ramos-Fresnedo, A.; Zarco, N.; Carrano, A.; Rossoll, W.; Asmann, Y. W.; Lam, T. T.; Chaichana, K. L.; Anastasiadis, P. Z.; Quinones-Hinojosa, A.; Guerrero-Cazares, H.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553966\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. GBM proximal to the lateral ventricles (LVs) is more aggressive, potentially due to subventricular zone (SVZ) contact. Despite this, crosstalk between GBM and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPCs) is not well understood. Using cell-specific proteomics, we show that LV-proximal GBM prevents neuronal maturation of NSCs through induction of senescence. Additionally, GBM brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increase expression of CTSB upon interaction with NPCs. Lentiviral knockdown and recombinant protein experiments reveal both cell-intrinsic and soluble CTSB promote malignancy-associated phenotypes in BTICs. Soluble CTSB stalls neuronal maturation in NPCs while promoting senescence, providing a link between LV-tumor proximity and neurogenesis disruption. Finally, we show LV-proximal CTSB upregulation in patients, showing the relevance of this crosstalk in human GBM biology. These results demonstrate the value of proteomic analysis in tumor microenvironment research and provide direction for new therapeutic strategies in GBM. HighlightsO_LIPeriventricular GBM is more malignant and disrupts neurogenesis in a rodent model. C_LIO_LICell-specific proteomics elucidates tumor-promoting crosstalk between GBM and NPCs. C_LIO_LINPCs induce upregulated CTSB expression in GBM, promoting tumor progression. C_LIO_LIGBM stalls neurogenesis and promotes NPC senescence via CTSB.

L.; Rosenbluh, J.; Vissers, J. H. A.; Harvey, K. F.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553491\nThe Hippo tumour suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some now entering clinical trials for different cancers. Here, we investigated the cellular response to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, using a combination of genomic and genetic strategies. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens identified genes that modulate the cellular response to TEAD inhibition, including members of the Hippo, MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. By exploring gene expression programs of mutant cells, we found that MAPK pathway hyperactivation confers resistance to TEAD inhibition by reinstating expression of a subset of YAP/TEAD target genes. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK protein MEK, synergistically blocked proliferation of several mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduced the growth of patient-derived lung cancers in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEADs and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.\nColibactin-induced genotoxicity and colorectal cancer exacerbation critically depends on adhesin-mediated epithelial binding\nAuthors: Jans, M.; Kolata, M.; Blancke, G.; Ciers, M.; Dohlman, A. B.; Kusakabe, T.; Sze, M.; Thiran, A.; Berx, G.; Tejpar, S.; van Loo, G.; Iliev, I. D.; Remaut, H.; Vereecke, L.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553526\nVarious bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, including pks+ E. coli which produce the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells. It remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells and its DNA to cause harm. Using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC, we found that pks+ E. coli drives CRC exacerbation and tissue invasion in a colibactin-dependent manner. Using isogenic mutant strains, we further demonstrate that CRC exacerbation critically depends on expression of the E. coli type-1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9-pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. Together, we show that the oncogenic potential of pks+ E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells and is critically mediated by specific bacterial adhesins. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic avenues for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aiming at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC.\nThe eIF4A2 negative regulator of mRNA translation promotes extracellular matrix deposition to accelerate hepatocellular carcinoma initiation\nAuthors: Moore, M.; Pardo, L.; Mitchell, L.; Schmidt, T.; May, S.; Mueller, M.; Strathdee, D.; Bryson, S.; Hodge, K.; Lilla, S.; Zanivan, S.; Waldron, J.; McGarry, L.; Peter-Durairaj, R.; Kanellos, G.; Nixon, C.; Ballantyne, F.; LeQuesne, J.; Sansom, O. J.; Bird, T.; Bushell, M.; Norman, J. C.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553544\nIncreased protein synthesis enables proliferation of established tumors. However, how mRNA translation contributes to early tumorigenesis remains unclear. Following oncogene activation, hepatocytes enter a non-proliferative/senescent-like phase characterised by deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) niches which then promote subsequent progression to proliferating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We demonstrate that removal of eIF4A2, a negative regulator of mRNA translation, upregulates synthesis of membrane/secretory proteins. This leads to a compensatory increase of integrin degradation which, in turn, compromises generation of ECM-rich tumour initiation niches and progression to proliferating HCC. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mRNA translation following eIF4A2 deletion restores ECM deposition and reinstates HCC progression. Our results highlight how the way in which cells respond to dysregulated mRNA translation in early tumorigenesis influences cancer outcomes. One-Sentence SummaryEnhancing rates of secretory protein synthesis during early oncogenesis retards cancer initiation by inhibiting ECM deposition.\nUnraveling Vulnerabilities in Endocrine Therapy-Resistant HER2+/ER+ Breast Cancer\nAuthors: Bahnassy, S.; Stires, H.; Jin, L.; Tam, S.; Mobin, D.; Balachandran, M.; Podar, M. B.; McCoy, M. D.; Beckman, R. A.; Riggins, R. B.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554116\nBackgroundBreast tumors overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) confer intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy (ET), and patients with HER2/ estrogen receptor-positive (HER2+/HR+) breast cancer (BCa) are less responsive to ET than HER2-/ER+. However, real-world evidence reveals that a large subset of HER2+/ER+ patients receive ET as monotherapy, positioning this treatment pattern as a clinical challenge. In the present study, we developed and characterized two distinct in vitro models of ET-resistant (ETR) HER2+/ER+ BCa to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities. MethodsTo mimic ETR to aromatase inhibitors (AI), we developed two long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) cell lines from BT-474 (BT474) and MDA-MB-361 (MM361). Growth assays, PAM50 molecular subtyping, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, followed by validation and functional studies, were used to identify targetable differences between ET-responsive parental and ETR-LTED HER2+/ER+ cells. ResultsCompared to their parental cells, MM361 LTEDs grew faster, lost ER, and increased HER2 expression, whereas BT474 LTEDs grew slower and maintained ER and HER2 expression. Both LTED variants had reduced responsiveness to fulvestrant. Whole-genome sequencing of the more aggressive MM361 LTED model system identified exonic mutations in genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a shift towards non-luminal phenotypes, and revealed metabolic remodeling of MM361 LTEDs, with upregulated lipid metabolism and antioxidant genes associated with ferroptosis, including GPX4. Combining the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 with anti-HER2 agents induced significant cell death in both the MM361 and BT474 LTEDs. ConclusionsThe BT474 and MM361 AI-resistant models capture distinct phenotypes of HER2+/ER+ BCa and identify altered lipid metabolism and ferroptosis remodeling as vulnerabilities of this type of ETR BCa.\nOvercome Prostate Cancer Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Therapy with Ketogenic Diet-Induced Epigenetic Reprogramming\nAuthors: Murphy, S.; Rahmy, S.; Gan, D.; Zhu, Y.; Manyak, M.; Li, J.; Lu, X.; Lu, X.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552383\nAdvanced prostate cancer (PCa) is overwhelmingly resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, representing a formidable clinical challenge. In this study, we developed a syngeneic murine PCa model with acquired ICB resistance. Using this model, synergistic efficacy was achieved by combining anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, a cyclic ketogenic diet (CKD), or supplementation of ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB, endogenous HDACi) via 1,3-butanediol-admixed food. CKD and BHB supplementation delayed PCa tumors as monotherapy, and both BHB and adaptive immunity are required for the anti-tumor activity of CKD. Single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that the HDACi and ketogenesis-enhanced ICB therapy involves cancer-cell-intrinsic (upregulated MHC class I molecules) and extrinsic mechanisms (CD8+ T cell chemoattraction, M1/M2 macrophage rebalancing, monocyte differentiation toward antigen presenting cells, and diminished neutrophils). Overall, these findings underscore the potential of using HDACi and optimized KD to enhance ICB therapy for PCa.\nMultiplex imaging of localized prostate tumors reveals changes in mast cell type composition and spatial organization of AR-positive cells in the tumor microenvironment\nAuthors: Ak, C.; Sayar, Z.; Thibault, G.; Burlingame, E.; Eng, J.; Chitsazan, A.; Adey, A.; Boniface, C.; Spellman, P. T.; Thomas, G. V.; Kopp, R.; Demir, E.; Chang, Y. H.; Stavrinides, V.; Eksi, S. E.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553854\nMapping spatial interactions of cancer, immune and stromal cells present novel opportunities for patient stratification and for advancing immunotherapy. While single-cell studies revealed significant molecular heterogeneity in prostate tumors, there is currently no understanding of how immune cell heterogeneity impacts spatial coordination between tumor and stromal cells in localized tumors. Here, we used cyclic immunofluorescent imaging on whole-tissue sections to uncover novel spatial associations between cancer and stromal cells in low- and high-grade prostate tumors and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide a spatial map of 699,461 single-cells that show epigenetic and molecular differences in distinct clinical grades. We report unique populations of mast cells that differentially express CD44, CD90 and Granzyme B (GZMB) and demonstrate GZMB+ mast cells are spatially associated with M2 macrophages in prostate tumors. Finally, we uncover recurrent neighborhoods that are primarily driven by androgen receptor positive (AR+) stromal cells and identify transcriptional networks active in AR+ prostate stroma.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Metastasis is the principal cause of cancer death, yet we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states, their relationship to primary tumor states, and the mechanisms by which they transition. In a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that while primary tumors largely adopt LGR5&#43; intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Loss of intestinal cell states is accompanied by reprogramming into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state, followed by non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, which is exacerbated by chemotherapy and associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cancer cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues than their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumor counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a stabilizer of intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, whose downregulation licenses non-canonical reprogramming.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We re-analyzed the data from a recent large-scale study that reported strong correlations between microbial organisms and 33 different cancer types, and that created machine learning predictors with near-perfect accuracy at distinguishing among cancers. We found at least two fundamental flaws in the reported data and in the methods: (1) errors in the genome database and the associated computational methods led to millions of false positive findings of bacterial reads across all samples, largely because most of the sequences identified as bacteria were instead human; and (2) errors in transformation of the raw data created an artificial signature, even for microbes with no reads detected, tagging each tumor type with a distinct signal that the machine learning programs then used to create an apparently accurate classifier. Each of these problems invalidates the results, leading to the conclusion that the microbiome-based classifiers for identifying cancer presented in the study are entirely wrong. These flaws have subsequently affected more than a dozen additional published studies that used the same data and whose results are likely invalid as well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for the majority of cancer cases. Much cancer research has focused on genetic alterations and their relation to different carcinoma phenotypes. Besides a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here, we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer, and propose that they emerge from a mechanical buckling instability upon epithelial overgrowth. Using a combination of microscopy imaging of the mouse and human bladder tissue, elasticity theory, and numerical simulations of differential growth in the bladder mucosa, we find that aberrant tissue morphologies can emerge through stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds exhibit qualitative and quantitative similarity with imaged early papillary tumors and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy indeed reveals local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a mechanical origin of the different carcinoma subtypes in the bladder, which have vastly different clinical prognosis. They might provide the basis for a new line of attack in medical carcinoma treatment and prophylaxis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. GBM proximal to the lateral ventricles (LVs) is more aggressive, potentially due to subventricular zone (SVZ) contact. Despite this, crosstalk between GBM and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPCs) is not well understood. Using cell-specific proteomics, we show that LV-proximal GBM prevents neuronal maturation of NSCs through induction of senescence. Additionally, GBM brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increase expression of CTSB upon interaction with NPCs. Lentiviral knockdown and recombinant protein experiments reveal both cell-intrinsic and soluble CTSB promote malignancy-associated phenotypes in BTICs. Soluble CTSB stalls neuronal maturation in NPCs while promoting senescence, providing a link between LV-tumor proximity and neurogenesis disruption. Finally, we show LV-proximal CTSB upregulation in patients, showing the relevance of this crosstalk in human GBM biology. These results demonstrate the value of proteomic analysis in tumor microenvironment research and provide direction for new therapeutic strategies in GBM.

        <p class="abstract">The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some now entering clinical trials for different cancers. Here, we investigated the cellular response to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, using a combination of genomic and genetic strategies. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens identified genes that modulate the cellular response to TEAD inhibition, including members of the Hippo, MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. By exploring gene expression programs of mutant cells, we found that MAPK pathway hyperactivation confers resistance to TEAD inhibition by reinstating expression of a subset of YAP/TEAD target genes. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK protein MEK, synergistically blocked proliferation of several mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduced the growth of patient-derived lung cancers in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEADs and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Various bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, including pks&#43; E. coli which produce the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells. It remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells and its DNA to cause harm. Using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC, we found that pks&#43; E. coli drives CRC exacerbation and tissue invasion in a colibactin-dependent manner. Using isogenic mutant strains, we further demonstrate that CRC exacerbation critically depends on expression of the E. coli type-1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9-pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. Together, we show that the oncogenic potential of pks&#43; E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells and is critically mediated by specific bacterial adhesins. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic avenues for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aiming at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increased protein synthesis enables proliferation of established tumors. However, how mRNA translation contributes to early tumorigenesis remains unclear. Following oncogene activation, hepatocytes enter a non-proliferative/senescent-like phase characterised by deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) niches which then promote subsequent progression to proliferating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We demonstrate that removal of eIF4A2, a negative regulator of mRNA translation, upregulates synthesis of membrane/secretory proteins. This leads to a compensatory increase of integrin degradation which, in turn, compromises generation of ECM-rich tumour initiation niches and progression to proliferating HCC. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mRNA translation following eIF4A2 deletion restores ECM deposition and reinstates HCC progression. Our results highlight how the way in which cells respond to dysregulated mRNA translation in early tumorigenesis influences cancer outcomes.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBreast tumors overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) confer intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy (ET), and patients with HER2/ estrogen receptor-positive (HER2&#43;/HR&#43;) breast cancer (BCa) are less responsive to ET than HER2-/ER&#43;. However, real-world evidence reveals that a large subset of HER2&#43;/ER&#43; patients receive ET as monotherapy, positioning this treatment pattern as a clinical challenge. In the present study, we developed and characterized two distinct in vitro models of ET-resistant (ETR) HER2&#43;/ER&#43; BCa to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities.

MethodsTo mimic ETR to aromatase inhibitors (AI), we developed two long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) cell lines from BT-474 (BT474) and MDA-MB-361 (MM361). Growth assays, PAM50 molecular subtyping, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, followed by validation and functional studies, were used to identify targetable differences between ET-responsive parental and ETR-LTED HER2&#43;/ER&#43; cells.

ResultsCompared to their parental cells, MM361 LTEDs grew faster, lost ER, and increased HER2 expression, whereas BT474 LTEDs grew slower and maintained ER and HER2 expression. Both LTED variants had reduced responsiveness to fulvestrant. Whole-genome sequencing of the more aggressive MM361 LTED model system identified exonic mutations in genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a shift towards non-luminal phenotypes, and revealed metabolic remodeling of MM361 LTEDs, with upregulated lipid metabolism and antioxidant genes associated with ferroptosis, including GPX4. Combining the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 with anti-HER2 agents induced significant cell death in both the MM361 and BT474 LTEDs.

ConclusionsThe BT474 and MM361 AI-resistant models capture distinct phenotypes of HER2&#43;/ER&#43; BCa and identify altered lipid metabolism and ferroptosis remodeling as vulnerabilities of this type of ETR BCa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is overwhelmingly resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, representing a formidable clinical challenge. In this study, we developed a syngeneic murine PCa model with acquired ICB resistance. Using this model, synergistic efficacy was achieved by combining anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, a cyclic ketogenic diet (CKD), or supplementation of ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB, endogenous HDACi) via 1,3-butanediol-admixed food. CKD and BHB supplementation delayed PCa tumors as monotherapy, and both BHB and adaptive immunity are required for the anti-tumor activity of CKD. Single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that the HDACi and ketogenesis-enhanced ICB therapy involves cancer-cell-intrinsic (upregulated MHC class I molecules) and extrinsic mechanisms (CD8&#43; T cell chemoattraction, M1/M2 macrophage rebalancing, monocyte differentiation toward antigen presenting cells, and diminished neutrophils). Overall, these findings underscore the potential of using HDACi and optimized KD to enhance ICB therapy for PCa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mapping spatial interactions of cancer, immune and stromal cells present novel opportunities for patient stratification and for advancing immunotherapy. While single-cell studies revealed significant molecular heterogeneity in prostate tumors, there is currently no understanding of how immune cell heterogeneity impacts spatial coordination between tumor and stromal cells in localized tumors. Here, we used cyclic immunofluorescent imaging on whole-tissue sections to uncover novel spatial associations between cancer and stromal cells in low- and high-grade prostate tumors and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide a spatial map of 699,461 single-cells that show epigenetic and molecular differences in distinct clinical grades. We report unique populations of mast cells that differentially express CD44, CD90 and Granzyme B (GZMB) and demonstrate GZMB&#43; mast cells are spatially associated with M2 macrophages in prostate tumors. Finally, we uncover recurrent neighborhoods that are primarily driven by androgen receptor positive (AR&#43;) stromal cells and identify transcriptional networks active in AR&#43; prostate stroma.</p>
