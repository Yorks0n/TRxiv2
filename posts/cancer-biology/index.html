J.; Thiessen, R.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556421\nMalignant gliomas are notoriously invasive, a major impediment against their successful treatment. This invasive growth has motivated the use of predictive partial differential equation models, formulated at varying levels of detail, and including (i) \"proliferation-infiltration\" models, (ii) \"go-or-grow\" models, and (iii) anisotropic diffusion models. Often, these models use macroscopic observations of a diffuse tumour interface to motivate a phenomenological description of invasion, rather than performing a detailed and mechanistic modelling of glioma cell invasion processes. Here we close this gap. Based on experiments that support an important role played by long cellular protrusions, termed tumour microtubes, we formulate a new model for microtube-driven glioma invasion. In particular, we model a population of tumour cells that extend tissue-infiltrating microtubes. Mitosis leads to new nuclei that migrate along the microtubes and settle elsewhere. A combination of steady state analysis and numerical simulation is employed to show that the model can predict an expanding tumour, with travelling wave solutions led by microtube dynamics. A sequence of scaling arguments allows us reduce the detailed model into simpler formulations, including models falling into each of the general classes (i), (ii), and (iii) above. This analysis allows us to clearly identify the assumptions under which these various models can be a posteriori justified in the context of microtube-driven glioma invasion. Numerical simulations are used to compare the various model classes and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages.\nLow albumin status accompanies multi-layered immunosuppressive phenotypes in metastatic breast cancer patients\nAuthors: Nakamura, Y.; Yoda, M.; Izumi, Y.; Kashima, Y.; Takahashi, M.; Nakatani, K.; Bamba, T.; He, C.; Konishi, R.; Saldajeno, D. P.; Vandenbon, A.; Suzuki, Y.; Toi, M.; Kawaguchi, K.; Kawaoka, S.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556440\nLow albumin status is prevalent in advanced cancer patients, but the pathophysiology associated with this anomaly remains largely unexplored. To address this, we aim to search correlations of albumin levels with the transcriptome against peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma metabolome within the same patients having metastatic breast cancers. We confirm that metastatic breast cancer patients exhibit low albumin levels in varying degrees without prominent systemic inflammation. Our data demonstrate that low albumin levels correlate with transcriptome signatures indicative of \"neutrophil activation and T-cell down-regulation,\" an immunosuppressive phenotype. We also find that immunoregulatory metabolites, such as arginine, are reduced in plasma in an albumin-correlated manner, further corroborating systemic immunosuppression. These results are verified using a mouse model of breast cancer. We conclude that low albumin status in metastatic breast cancer patients accompanies immunosuppressive phenotypes, which is likely unfavorable for anti-cancer immunotherapy and thus can be a cause of unsuccessful treatment outcomes.\nThe SLC1A1/EAAT3 Dicarboxylic Amino Acid Transporter is an Epigenetically Dysregulated Nutrient Carrier that Sustains Oncogenic Metabolic Programs\nAuthors: Grubb, T. M.; Khatun, J.; Matar, S.; Ghandour, F.; Dubasik, N.; Salem, C.; Orlando, D. A.; Guenther, M. G.; Martinez, S. R.; Koochaki, P.; Coker, J. A.; Tang, C.; Reznik, E.; Kotecha, R. R.; Hakimi, A.

A.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556240\nInactivation of pVHL tumor suppressor in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) increases the abundance of Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). We hypothesized that H3K27ac, a marker of transcriptional activation, drives the expression of critical oncogenes in ccRCC. Using H3K27ac ChIP-Seq; RNA-Seq; an in vivo positive selection screen; cell-based functional studies; and clinical validations; here, we report the identification of the SLC1A1/EAAT3 aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) transporter as a ccRCC oncogene. pVHL loss promotes SLC1A1 expression in a HIF-independent manner. Importantly, SLC1A1 inactivation depletes Asp/Glu-derived metabolites, impedes ccRCC growth both in vitro and in vivo, and sensitizes ccRCCs to metabolic therapeutics (e.g., glutaminase blockers). Finally, in human ccRCC biospecimens, higher SLC1A1 expression is associated with metastatic disease and clusters with elevated expression of other solute carriers, but not HIF/Hypoxia pathways. Altogether, our studies identify a HIF-independent metabolic hub in ccRCC and credential SLC1A1 as an actionable ccRCC oncogene. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCETargeting chronic HIF activation underlies many therapeutic strategies in ccRCC; but, unfortunately, is not curative. SLC1A1, instead, represents a HIF-independent ccRCC dependency, which is targetable alone and together with other antimetabolites, such as glutaminase inhibitors. These observations identify an actionable metabolic program that functions independent of HIF in ccRCC.\nTPX2 expression promotes sensitivity to dasatinib in breast cancer by activating the YAP transcriptional signaling.\nAuthors: Marugan, C.; Ortigosa, B.; Sanz-Gomez, N.; Monfort-Vengut, A.; Bertinetti, C.; Teijo, A.; Gonzalez, M.; Alonso de la Vega, A.; Lallena, M. J.; Moreno-Bueno, G.; de Carcer, G.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556165\nChromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, providing genetic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity that allows the tumor to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. CIN is considered a cancer therapeutic biomarker because healthy cells do not exhibit CIN. Despite recent efforts to identify therapeutic strategies related to CIN, the results obtained have been very limited. CIN is characterized by a genetic signature where a collection of genes, mostly mitotic regulators, are overexpressed in CIN-positive tumors, providing aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We attempted to identify new therapeutic strategies related to CIN genes by performing a drug screen, using cells that individually express CIN-associated genes in an inducible manner. We find that the overexpression of TPX2 enhances sensitivity to the SRC inhibitor dasatinib due to activation of the YAP pathway. Furthermore, using breast cancer data from the TCGA and a cohort of cancer-derived patient samples, we find that both TPX2 expression and YAP activation are present in a significant percentage of cancer tumor samples, providing poor prognosis, being therefore putative biomarkers for dasatinib therapy.\nClinically relevant orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for adoptive T cell therapy\nAuthors: Horvat, N. K.; Karpovsky, I.; Wyatt, M.; Hall, M. A.; Phillips, M.; Herting, C.; Hammons, J.; Mahdi, Z.; Moffitt, R. A.; Paulos, C.; Lesinski, G. B.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556707\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor. Prognosis is poor and survival is low in patients diagnosed with this disease; ~12% at 5 years. Immunotherapy, including adoptive T cell transfer therapy, has not impacted outcomes in PDAC patients, due in part to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) which limits T cell trafficking and persistence. We posit that murine models serve as useful tools to study the fate of T cell therapy. Currently, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PDAC are considered a gold-standard as they recapitulate many aspects of human disease. However, these models have limitations, including marked tumor variability across individual mice and cost of colony maintenance. We characterized the immunologic features and trafficking patterns of adoptively transferred T cells in orthotopic PDAC models using two mouse cell lines, KPC-Luc and MT-5, isolated from KPC-GEMM mouse models (KrasLSL-G12D/+p53-/- and KrasLSL-G12D/+p53LSL-R172H/+, respectively). The MT 5 orthotopic model best recapitulates the cellular and stromal features of the TME in the PDAC GEMM. In contrast, far more host immune cells infiltrate KPC-Luc tumors, which have less stroma. Albeit CD4+ T cells were similarly detected in MT-5 tumors compared to KPC-GEMM in mice. Interestingly, we found that CAR T cells redirected to recognize mesothelin on these tumors that signal via CD3{zeta} and 41BB (Meso-41BB{zeta}-CAR T cells) post antigen recognition infiltrated the tumors of mice bearing stroma-devoid KPC-Luc orthotopic tumors, but not MT-5 tumors. Our data establish for the first time a reproducible and realistic clinical system useful for modeling stroma-rich and stroma-devoid PDAC tumors. These models shall serve in-depth study of how to overcome barriers that limit anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.\nRole of Lactate in the Regulation of Transcriptional Activity of Breast Cancer-Related Genes and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Proteins: A Comparison of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell Lines\nAuthors: San-Millan, I.; Martinez, J. L.; Pickard, S. L.; Yu, H.; Hirsch, F. R.; Rivard, C. J.; Brooks, G. A.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.23.533060\nThe Warburg Effect is characterized by accelerated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production and under fully aerobic conditions is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of endogenous, glucose-derived lactate as an oncometabolite which regulates gene expression in the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 cell line cultivated in glucose media. Presently, with the addition of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, we further confirm the effect of lactate on gene expression patterns and extend results to include lactate effects on protein expression. As well, we report effects of lactate on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endogenous lactate regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. In MCF7 cells, lactate increased the expression of EGFR, VEGF, HIF-1a, KRAS, MIF, mTOR, PIK3CA, TP53, and CDK4 as well as decreased the expression of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, E2F1, MET, MYC, and RAF mainly after 48h of exposure. On the other hand, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, lactate increased the expressions of PIK3CA, VEGF, EGFR, mTOR, HIF-1, ATM, E2F1, TP53 and decreased the expressions of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, MET, MIF, MYC, and RAF after 48h of exposure. In response to endogenous lactate, changes in protein expression of representative genes corroborated changes in mRNA expressions. Finally, lactate exposure decreased E-cadherin protein expression in MCF7 cells and increased vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further-more, by genetically silencing LDHA in MCF7 cells, we show suppression of protein expression of EGFR and HIF-1, while full protein expression occurred under glucose and glucose + exogenous lactate exposure. Hence, endogenous, glucose-derived lactate, and not glucose, elicited changes in gene and protein expression levels. In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous lactate produced under aerobic conditions (Warburg Effect) elicits important changes in gene and protein expression in both ER+ and TNBC cell lines. The widespread regulation of multiple genes by lactate and involves those involved in carcinogenesis including DNA repair, cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, lactate affected the expression of two relevant EMT biomarkers, E-cadherin and vimentin, which could contribute to the complex process of EMT and a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype in the two cancer cell lines studied.\nConvergent alterations in the tumor microenvironment of MYC-driven human and murine prostate cancer\nAuthors: Graham, M.

J.; Nelson, W.; Lupold, S. E.; DeWeese, T. L.; De Marzo, A. M.; Yegnasubramanian, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.553268\nThe tissue microenvironment in prostate cancer is profoundly altered. While such alterations have been implicated in driving prostate cancer initiation and progression to aggressive disease, how prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate those changes is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we performed extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and rigorous molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key time points in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues, with validation in a large external data set, revealed that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling was the top up-regulated pathway in human cancers, representing a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Likewise, numerous non-malignant cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including non-cancerous epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell compartments, were conserved across individuals, raising the possibility that these cell types may be a sequelae of the convergent MYC activation in the cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GEMM of prostate epithelial cell-specific MYC activation in two mouse strains. Cell communication network and pathway analyses suggested that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogrammed the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to the emergence of cascading cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that paralleled key findings in human prostate cancer. Importantly, among these changes, the progression from a precursor-enriched to invasive-cancer-enriched state was accompanied by a cell-intrinsic switch from pro-immunogenic to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs with coinciding enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid and Treg cells in the immune microenvironment. These findings implicate activation of MYC signaling in reshaping convergent aspects of the TME of prostate cancer as a common denominator across the otherwise well-documented molecular heterogeneity of human prostate cancer.\nIn Vivo Biorthogonal Antibody Click for Dual Targeting and Augmented Efficacy in Cancer Treatment\nAuthors: Panikar, S.; Berry, N.-K.; Shmuel, S.; Keltee, L.; Pereira, P. R.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556426\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as promising therapeutics for cancer treatment; however, their effectiveness has been limited by single antigen targeting, potentially leading to resistance mechanisms triggered by tumor compensatory pathways or reduced expression of the target protein. Here, we present antibody-ADC click, an approach that harnesses bioorthogonal click chemistry for in vivo dual targeting of ADCs, irrespective of the tumors expression of the ADC-targeting antigen. We conjugated the bioorthogonal click moieties tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) to both antibodies and ADCs. Through in vivo clicking of antibody-TCO with antibody-Tz, we achieved sequential dual-receptor targeting in tumors. We show that the clicked antibody therapy outperformed conventional ADC monotherapy in preclinical models mimicking ADC-eligible, ADC-resistant, and ADC-ineligible tumors. Antibody-ADC click allows reversal of drug resistance through multi-antigen targeting and enhanced ADC accumulation within tumors. Antibody-ADC click enables in vivo multi-targeting without extensive bioengineering, sustains tumor treatment, and enhances antibody-mediated cytotoxicity.\nChromatin Profiling of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 AMLs Identifies Key Transcription Factor Dependencies and BRG1 Inhibition as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy\nAuthors: Kaonis, S.; Smith, J. L.; Katiyar, N.; Merrill, M.; Hylkema, T.; Namciu, S.; Le, Q.; Babaeva, E.; Ikeda, T.; Morris, S. M.; Girard, E.; Furuyama, S.; Ries, R.; Bernstein, I.; Meshinchi, S.; Henikoff, S.; Meers, M. P.; Hadland, B. K.; Sarthy, J. F.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555598\nOncogenic fusions involving transcription factors are present in the majority of pediatric leukemias; however, the context-specific mechanisms they employ to drive cancer remain poorly understood. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (C/G) fusions occur in treatment-refractory acute myeloid leukemias and are restricted to young children. To understand how the C/G fusion drives oncogenesis we applied CUT\u0026RUN chromatin profiling to an umbilical cord blood/endothelial cell (EC) co-culture model of C/G AML that recapitulates the biology of this malignancy. We find C/G fusion binding is mediated by its zinc finger domains. Integration of fusion binding sites in C/G- transduced cells with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) sites in control cord blood cells identifies MYCN, ZFPM1, ZBTB16 and LMO2 as direct C/G targets. Transcriptomic analysis of a large pediatric AML cohort shows that these genes are upregulated in C/G patient samples. Single cell RNA-sequencing of umbilical cord blood identifies a population of megakaryocyte precursors that already express many of these genes despite lacking the fusion. By integrating CUT\u0026RUN data with CRISPR dependency screens we identify BRG1/SMARCA4 as a vulnerability in C/G AML. BRG1 profiling in C/G patient-derived cell lines shows that the CBFA2T3 locus is a binding site, and treatment with clinically-available BRG1 inhibitors reduces fusion levels and downstream C/G targets including N-MYC, resulting in C/G leukemia cell death and extending survival in a murine xenograft model.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Malignant gliomas are notoriously invasive, a major impediment against their successful treatment. This invasive growth has motivated the use of predictive partial differential equation models, formulated at varying levels of detail, and including (i) &#34;proliferation-infiltration&#34; models, (ii) &#34;go-or-grow&#34; models, and (iii) anisotropic diffusion models. Often, these models use macroscopic observations of a diffuse tumour interface to motivate a phenomenological description of invasion, rather than performing a detailed and mechanistic modelling of glioma cell invasion processes. Here we close this gap. Based on experiments that support an important role played by long cellular protrusions, termed tumour microtubes, we formulate a new model for microtube-driven glioma invasion. In particular, we model a population of tumour cells that extend tissue-infiltrating microtubes. Mitosis leads to new nuclei that migrate along the microtubes and settle elsewhere. A combination of steady state analysis and numerical simulation is employed to show that the model can predict an expanding tumour, with travelling wave solutions led by microtube dynamics. A sequence of scaling arguments allows us reduce the detailed model into simpler formulations, including models falling into each of the general classes (i), (ii), and (iii) above. This analysis allows us to clearly identify the assumptions under which these various models can be a posteriori justified in the context of microtube-driven glioma invasion. Numerical simulations are used to compare the various model classes and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low albumin status is prevalent in advanced cancer patients, but the pathophysiology associated with this anomaly remains largely unexplored. To address this, we aim to search correlations of albumin levels with the transcriptome against peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma metabolome within the same patients having metastatic breast cancers. We confirm that metastatic breast cancer patients exhibit low albumin levels in varying degrees without prominent systemic inflammation. Our data demonstrate that low albumin levels correlate with transcriptome signatures indicative of &#34;neutrophil activation and T-cell down-regulation,&#34; an immunosuppressive phenotype. We also find that immunoregulatory metabolites, such as arginine, are reduced in plasma in an albumin-correlated manner, further corroborating systemic immunosuppression. These results are verified using a mouse model of breast cancer. We conclude that low albumin status in metastatic breast cancer patients accompanies immunosuppressive phenotypes, which is likely unfavorable for anti-cancer immunotherapy and thus can be a cause of unsuccessful treatment outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inactivation of pVHL tumor suppressor in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) increases the abundance of Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). We hypothesized that H3K27ac, a marker of transcriptional activation, drives the expression of critical oncogenes in ccRCC. Using H3K27ac ChIP-Seq; RNA-Seq; an in vivo positive selection screen; cell-based functional studies; and clinical validations; here, we report the identification of the SLC1A1/EAAT3 aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) transporter as a ccRCC oncogene. pVHL loss promotes SLC1A1 expression in a HIF-independent manner. Importantly, SLC1A1 inactivation depletes Asp/Glu-derived metabolites, impedes ccRCC growth both in vitro and in vivo, and sensitizes ccRCCs to metabolic therapeutics (e.g., glutaminase blockers). Finally, in human ccRCC biospecimens, higher SLC1A1 expression is associated with metastatic disease and clusters with elevated expression of other solute carriers, but not HIF/Hypoxia pathways. Altogether, our studies identify a HIF-independent metabolic hub in ccRCC and credential SLC1A1 as an actionable ccRCC oncogene.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCETargeting chronic HIF activation underlies many therapeutic strategies in ccRCC; but, unfortunately, is not curative. SLC1A1, instead, represents a HIF-independent ccRCC dependency, which is targetable alone and together with other antimetabolites, such as glutaminase inhibitors. These observations identify an actionable metabolic program that functions independent of HIF in ccRCC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, providing genetic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity that allows the tumor to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. CIN is considered a cancer therapeutic biomarker because healthy cells do not exhibit CIN. Despite recent efforts to identify therapeutic strategies related to CIN, the results obtained have been very limited. CIN is characterized by a genetic signature where a collection of genes, mostly mitotic regulators, are overexpressed in CIN-positive tumors, providing aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We attempted to identify new therapeutic strategies related to CIN genes by performing a drug screen, using cells that individually express CIN-associated genes in an inducible manner. We find that the overexpression of TPX2 enhances sensitivity to the SRC inhibitor dasatinib due to activation of the YAP pathway. Furthermore, using breast cancer data from the TCGA and a cohort of cancer-derived patient samples, we find that both TPX2 expression and YAP activation are present in a significant percentage of cancer tumor samples, providing poor prognosis, being therefore putative biomarkers for dasatinib therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor. Prognosis is poor and survival is low in patients diagnosed with this disease; ~12% at 5 years. Immunotherapy, including adoptive T cell transfer therapy, has not impacted outcomes in PDAC patients, due in part to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) which limits T cell trafficking and persistence. We posit that murine models serve as useful tools to study the fate of T cell therapy. Currently, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PDAC are considered a gold-standard as they recapitulate many aspects of human disease. However, these models have limitations, including marked tumor variability across individual mice and cost of colony maintenance. We characterized the immunologic features and trafficking patterns of adoptively transferred T cells in orthotopic PDAC models using two mouse cell lines, KPC-Luc and MT-5, isolated from KPC-GEMM mouse models (KrasLSL-G12D/&#43;p53-/- and KrasLSL-G12D/&#43;p53LSL-R172H/&#43;, respectively). The MT 5 orthotopic model best recapitulates the cellular and stromal features of the TME in the PDAC GEMM. In contrast, far more host immune cells infiltrate KPC-Luc tumors, which have less stroma. Albeit CD4&#43; T cells were similarly detected in MT-5 tumors compared to KPC-GEMM in mice. Interestingly, we found that CAR T cells redirected to recognize mesothelin on these tumors that signal via CD3{zeta} and 41BB (Meso-41BB{zeta}-CAR T cells) post antigen recognition infiltrated the tumors of mice bearing stroma-devoid KPC-Luc orthotopic tumors, but not MT-5 tumors. Our data establish for the first time a reproducible and realistic clinical system useful for modeling stroma-rich and stroma-devoid PDAC tumors. These models shall serve in-depth study of how to overcome barriers that limit anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Warburg Effect is characterized by accelerated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production and under fully aerobic conditions is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of endogenous, glucose-derived lactate as an oncometabolite which regulates gene expression in the estrogen receptor positive (ER&#43;) MCF7 cell line cultivated in glucose media. Presently, with the addition of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, we further confirm the effect of lactate on gene expression patterns and extend results to include lactate effects on protein expression. As well, we report effects of lactate on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endogenous lactate regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. In MCF7 cells, lactate increased the expression of EGFR, VEGF, HIF-1a, KRAS, MIF, mTOR, PIK3CA, TP53, and CDK4 as well as decreased the expression of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, E2F1, MET, MYC, and RAF mainly after 48h of exposure. On the other hand, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, lactate increased the expressions of PIK3CA, VEGF, EGFR, mTOR, HIF-1, ATM, E2F1, TP53 and decreased the expressions of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, MET, MIF, MYC, and RAF after 48h of exposure. In response to endogenous lactate, changes in protein expression of representative genes corroborated changes in mRNA expressions. Finally, lactate exposure decreased E-cadherin protein expression in MCF7 cells and increased vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further-more, by genetically silencing LDHA in MCF7 cells, we show suppression of protein expression of EGFR and HIF-1, while full protein expression occurred under glucose and glucose &#43; exogenous lactate exposure. Hence, endogenous, glucose-derived lactate, and not glucose, elicited changes in gene and protein expression levels.

In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous lactate produced under aerobic conditions (Warburg Effect) elicits important changes in gene and protein expression in both ER&#43; and TNBC cell lines. The widespread regulation of multiple genes by lactate and involves those involved in carcinogenesis including DNA repair, cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, lactate affected the expression of two relevant EMT biomarkers, E-cadherin and vimentin, which could contribute to the complex process of EMT and a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype in the two cancer cell lines studied.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tissue microenvironment in prostate cancer is profoundly altered. While such alterations have been implicated in driving prostate cancer initiation and progression to aggressive disease, how prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate those changes is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we performed extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and rigorous molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key time points in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues, with validation in a large external data set, revealed that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling was the top up-regulated pathway in human cancers, representing a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Likewise, numerous non-malignant cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including non-cancerous epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell compartments, were conserved across individuals, raising the possibility that these cell types may be a sequelae of the convergent MYC activation in the cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GEMM of prostate epithelial cell-specific MYC activation in two mouse strains. Cell communication network and pathway analyses suggested that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogrammed the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to the emergence of cascading cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that paralleled key findings in human prostate cancer. Importantly, among these changes, the progression from a precursor-enriched to invasive-cancer-enriched state was accompanied by a cell-intrinsic switch from pro-immunogenic to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs with coinciding enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid and Treg cells in the immune microenvironment. These findings implicate activation of MYC signaling in reshaping convergent aspects of the TME of prostate cancer as a common denominator across the otherwise well-documented molecular heterogeneity of human prostate cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as promising therapeutics for cancer treatment; however, their effectiveness has been limited by single antigen targeting, potentially leading to resistance mechanisms triggered by tumor compensatory pathways or reduced expression of the target protein. Here, we present antibody-ADC click, an approach that harnesses bioorthogonal click chemistry for in vivo dual targeting of ADCs, irrespective of the tumors expression of the ADC-targeting antigen. We conjugated the bioorthogonal click moieties tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) to both antibodies and ADCs. Through in vivo clicking of antibody-TCO with antibody-Tz, we achieved sequential dual-receptor targeting in tumors. We show that the clicked antibody therapy outperformed conventional ADC monotherapy in preclinical models mimicking ADC-eligible, ADC-resistant, and ADC-ineligible tumors. Antibody-ADC click allows reversal of drug resistance through multi-antigen targeting and enhanced ADC accumulation within tumors. Antibody-ADC click enables in vivo multi-targeting without extensive bioengineering, sustains tumor treatment, and enhances antibody-mediated cytotoxicity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Oncogenic fusions involving transcription factors are present in the majority of pediatric leukemias; however, the context-specific mechanisms they employ to drive cancer remain poorly understood. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (C/G) fusions occur in treatment-refractory acute myeloid leukemias and are restricted to young children. To understand how the C/G fusion drives oncogenesis we applied CUT&amp;RUN chromatin profiling to an umbilical cord blood/endothelial cell (EC) co-culture model of C/G AML that recapitulates the biology of this malignancy. We find C/G fusion binding is mediated by its zinc finger domains. Integration of fusion binding sites in C/G- transduced cells with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) sites in control cord blood cells identifies MYCN, ZFPM1, ZBTB16 and LMO2 as direct C/G targets. Transcriptomic analysis of a large pediatric AML cohort shows that these genes are upregulated in C/G patient samples. Single cell RNA-sequencing of umbilical cord blood identifies a population of megakaryocyte precursors that already express many of these genes despite lacking the fusion. By integrating CUT&amp;RUN data with CRISPR dependency screens we identify BRG1/SMARCA4 as a vulnerability in C/G AML. BRG1 profiling in C/G patient-derived cell lines shows that the CBFA2T3 locus is a binding site, and treatment with clinically-available BRG1 inhibitors reduces fusion levels and downstream C/G targets including N-MYC, resulting in C/G leukemia cell death and extending survival in a murine xenograft model.</p>
