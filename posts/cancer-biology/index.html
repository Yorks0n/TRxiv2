K.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556132\nNeuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial pediatric tumor and leads to 15% of all cancer-related deaths in children. Tumor relapse and therapy resistance in neuroblastoma are driven by phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity between noradrenergic (NOR) and mesenchymal (MES) cell states. Despite the importance of this phenotypic plasticity, however, the dynamics and molecular patterns associated with these bidirectional cell-state transitions remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we analyze multiple RNA-seq datasets at both bulk and single-cell resolution, to understand the association between NOR- and MES-specific factors. We observed that NOR-specific and MES-specific expression patterns are largely mutually exclusive, exhibiting a \"teams-like\" behavior among the genes involved, reminiscent of our earlier observations in lung cancer and melanoma. This antagonism was noticed also in the association of NOR and MES phenotypes with metabolic reprogramming and with immunotherapy targets PD-L1 and GD2, and in experimental perturbations driving the NOR-MES and/or MES-NOR transition. Further, this \"teams-like\" patterns was seen only among the NOR- and MES-specific genes, but not in housekeeping genes, possibly highlighting a hallmark of network topology enabling cancer cell plasticity.\nMouse models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are affected by the cre-driver used to promote KRASG12D activation.\nAuthors: Mousavi, F.; Thompson, J.; Lau, J.; Renollet, N.; Martin, M. B.; McGue, J.; Frankel, T.; Shooshtari, P.; Pin, C. L.; Bednar, F.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557383\nThe fundamental biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been greatly impacted by the characterization of genetically modified mouse models that allow temporal and spatial activation of oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D). The most commonly used model involves targeted insertion of a cre recombinase into the Ptf1a gene. However, this approach disrupts the Ptf1a gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency that likely affects sensitivity to oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D). The goal of this study was to determine if Ptf1a haploinsufficiency affected the acinar cell response to KRASG12D before and after induction of pancreatic injury. We performed morphological and molecular analysis of three mouse lines that express a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase to activate KRASG12D in acinar cells of the pancreas. The cre-recombinase was targeted to the acinar-specific transcription factor genes, Ptf1a and Mist1/Bhlha15, or expressed within a BAC-derived Elastase transgene. Up to two months after tamoxifen induction of KRASG12D, morphological changes were negligible. However, induction of pancreatic injury by cerulein resulted in stark differences in tissue morphology between lines within seven days, which were maintained for at least five weeks after injury. Ptf1acreERT pancreata showed widespread PanIN lesions and fibrosis, while the Mist1creERT and Ela-creERT models showed reduced amounts of pre-neoplastic lesions. RNA-seq analysis prior to inducing injury suggested Ptf1acreERT and Mist1creERT lines have unique profiles of gene expression that predict a differential response to injury. Multiplex analysis of pancreatic tissue confirmed different inflammatory responses between the lines. These findings suggest understanding the mechanisms underlying the differential response to KRASG12D will help in further defining the intrinsic KRAS-driven mechanisms of neoplasia initiation.\nSpatial molecular profiling of mixed invasive ductal-lobular breast cancers reveals heterogeneity in intrinsic molecular subtypes, oncogenic signatures and actionable driver mutations\nAuthors: Shah, O. S.; Nasrazadani, A.; Foldi, J.; Atkinson, J. M.; Kleer, C. G.; McAuliffe, P. F.; Da Silva, E. M.; Selenica, P.; Dopeso, H.; Pareja, F.; Mandelker, D.; Weigelt, B.; Reis-Filho, J. S.; Bhargava, R.; Lucas, P. C.; Lee, A. V.; Oesterreich, S.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.557013\nAbstract [N=135] Mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (mDLC) is a rare histologic subtype of breast cancer displaying both E-cadherin positive ductal and E-cadherin negative lobular morphologies within the same tumor, posing challenges with regard to anticipated clinical management. It remains unclear whether these distinct morphologies also have distinct biology and risk of recurrence. Our spatially-resolved transcriptomic, genomic, and single-cell profiling revealed clinically significant differences between ductal and lobular tumor regions including distinct intrinsic subtype heterogeneity (e.g., mDLC with TNBC/basal ductal and ER+/luminal lobular regions), distinct enrichment of senescence/dormancy and oncogenic (ER and MYC) signatures, genetic and epigenetic CDH1 inactivation in lobular, but not ductal regions, and 4) single-cell ductal and lobular sub-populations with unique oncogenic signatures further highlighting intra-regional heterogeneity. Altogether, we demonstrated that the intra-tumoral morphological/histological heterogeneity within mDLC is underpinned by intrinsic subtype and oncogenic heterogeneity which may result in prognostic uncertainty and therapeutic dilemma. Significance [N=58]mDLC displays both ductal and lobular tumor regions. Our multi-omic profiling approach revealed that these morphologically distinct tumor regions harbor distinct intrinsic subtypes and oncogenic features that may cause prognostic uncertainty and therapeutic dilemma. Thus histopathological/molecular profiling of individual tumor regions may guide clinical decision making and benefit patients with mDLC, particularly in the advanced setting where there is increased reliance on next generation sequencing.

J.; Wong, K.-K.; Ji, H.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556567\nKRASG12C inhibitors including adagrasib and sortorasib have shown clinical promise in targeting KRASG12C-mutated lung cancers, however, most patients eventually develop drug resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma patients with co-occurring KRASG12C and STK11/LKB1 mutations, we found a high squamous gene signature at baseline significantly correlated with poor adagrasib response. Through integrative studies of Lkb1-deficient KRASG12Cand KrasG12D lung cancer mouse models and/or organoids treated with KRAS inhibitors, we found tumor cells invoked a lineage plasticity program: adeno-to-squamous transition (AST) that mediated resistance to KRAS inhibition. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses revealed {Delta}Np63 drives AST and modulates response to KRAS inhibition. We identified an intermediate high-plasticity cell state with distinct gene expression program marked by Krt6a upregulation. Notably, higher KRT6A expression at baseline correlated with shorter overall survival in KRAS-mutant patients receiving adagrasib. These data support the role of AST in KRAS inhibitor resistance and provide predictive biomarker for KRAS-targeted therapies in lung cancer.\nClinically relevant orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for adoptive T cell therapy\nAuthors: Horvat, N. K.; Karpovsky, I.; Wyatt, M.; Hall, M. A.; Phillips, M.; Herting, C.; Hammons, J.; Mahdi, Z.; Moffitt, R. A.; Paulos, C.; Lesinski, G. B.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556707\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor. Prognosis is poor and survival is low in patients diagnosed with this disease; [~]12% at 5 years. Immunotherapy, including adoptive T cell transfer therapy, has not impacted outcomes in PDAC patients, due in part to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) which limits T cell trafficking and persistence. We posit that murine models serve as useful tools to study the fate of T cell therapy. Currently, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PDAC are considered a \"gold-standard\" as they recapitulate many aspects of human disease. However, these models have limitations, including marked tumor variability across individual mice and cost of colony maintenance. We characterized the immunologic features and trafficking patterns of adoptively transferred T cells in orthotopic PDAC models using two mouse cell lines, KPC-Luc and MT-5, isolated from KPC-GEMM mouse models (KrasLSL-G12D/+p53-/- and KrasLSL-G12D/+p53LSL-R172H/+, respectively). The MT-5 orthotopic model best recapitulates the cellular and stromal features of the TME in the PDAC GEMM. In contrast, far more host immune cells infiltrate KPC-Luc tumors, which have less stroma. Albeit CD4+ T cells were similarly detected in MT-5 tumors compared to KPC-GEMM in mice. Interestingly, we found that CAR T cells redirected to recognize mesothelin on these tumors that signal via CD3{sigma} and 41BB (Meso-41BB{sigma}-CAR T cells) post antigen recognition infiltrated the tumors of mice bearing stroma-devoid KPC-Luc orthotopic tumors, but not MT-5 tumors. Our data establish for the first time a reproducible and realistic clinical system useful for modeling stroma-rich and stroma-devoid PDAC tumors. These models shall serve in-depth study of how to overcome barriers that limit anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.\nMTOR as a selectable genomic harbor for CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cell therapy\nAuthors: Levesque, S.; Carleton, G.; Duque, V.; Goupil, C.; Fiset, J.-P.; Villeneuve, S.; Normandeau, E.; Morin, G.; Dumont, N.; Laganiere, J.; Boyle, B.; Lum, J. J.; Doyon, Y.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557485\nChimeric antigen receptors (CARs) reprogram T cells to recognize and target cancer cells. Despite remarkable responses observed with CAR-T cell therapy in patients with hematological malignancies, CAR-T cell engineering still relies mostly on randomly integrating vectors, limiting the possibilities of fine-tuning T cell function. Here, we designed a CRISPR-based marker-free selection strategy to simultaneously target a therapeutic transgene and a gain-of-function mutation to the MTOR locus to enrich cells resistant to rapamycin, a clinically used immunosuppressant. We readily engineered rapamycin-resistant (RapaR) CAR-T cells by targeting CAR expression cassettes to the MTOR locus. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and a humanized mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that RapaR-CAR-T cells can efficiently target CD19+ leukemia cells in presence of rapamycin. Furthermore, our strategy allows multiplexed targeting of rapamycin-regulated immunoreceptors complexes (DARICs) to the MTOR and TRAC loci to pharmacologically control CAR-T cells' activity. We foresee that our approach could both facilitate the enrichment of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells ex vivo and in vivo while improving tumor eradication.\nWITHDRAWN: Mechanism of the microRNA-4677-3p/LDHB axis in the regulation of paclitaxel resistance of breast cancer cells\nAuthors: Chen, Y.; Dong, Q.; Xing, L.; Yang, J.; Sun, Y.; Zhang, J.; Zhao, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556493\nObjectiveChemotherapy is a crucial treatment strategy for breast cancer (BC), while chemoresistance is a major barrier to BC treatment. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to be involved in chemoresistance. This paper aimed to decipher the mechanism of the miR-4677-3p/LDHB axis in BC drug resistance, with the aim of providing a potential target for drug resistance therapy in BC. MethodsBioinformatics analysis was used to screen out the target gene. BC drug-resistant cell line MCF-7/paclitaxel (PTX) was established using the drug concentration increment method. miR-4677-3p and LDHB expression levels in MCF-7/PTX cells were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The upstream miRNAs of LDHB were predicted by databases, and a candidate miRNA was obtained by taking the intersection, and verified by dual-luciferase assay. The effects of si-LDHB, miR-4677-3p mimics, or miR-4677-3p mimics + pcDNA3.1-LDHB in MCF-7/PTX cells were determined by CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. ResultsLDHB was the most significantly differentially-expressed in the microarray and was highly expressed in BC-resistant cell line. MCF-7/PTX cells upon transfection with si-LDHB exhibited suppressed proliferation, decreased number of colonies, and promoted apoptosis. Subsequently, miR-4677-3p was obtained by predicting the upstream miRNAs of LDHB through multiple databases and taking the intersection. miR-4677-3p targeted LDHB. miR-4677-3p suppressed drug-resistance to PTX in BC cells by down-regulating LDHB. Overexpression of LDHB partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-4677-3p on PTX resistance in BC cells. ConclusionmiR-4677-3p hindered drug-resistance of BC cells to PTX by down-regulating LDHB.\nAnalysis of a mouse germ cell tumor model establishes pluripotency-associated miRNAs as conserved serum biomarkers for germ cell cancer detection\nAuthors: Loehr, A.

S.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556995\nMalignant testicular germ cells tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid cancers in young men. Current TGCT diagnostics include conventional serum protein markers, but these lack the sensitivity and specificity to serve as accurate markers across all TGCT subtypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs and informative biomarkers for several diseases. In humans, miRNAs of the miR-371-373 cluster are detectable in the serum of patients with malignant TGCTs and outperform existing serum protein markers for both initial diagnosis and subsequent disease monitoring. We previously developed a genetically engineered mouse model featuring malignant mixed TGCTs consisting of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) and differentiated teratoma that, like the corresponding human malignancies, originate in utero and are highly chemosensitive. Here, we report that miRNAs in the mouse miR-290-295 cluster, homologs of the human miR-371-373 cluster, were detectable in serum from mice with malignant TGCTs but not from tumor-free control mice or mice with benign teratomas. miR-291-293 were expressed and secreted specifically by pluripotent EC cells, and expression was lost following differentiation induced by the drug thioridazine. Notably, miR-291-293 levels were significantly higher in the serum of pregnant dams carrying tumor-bearing fetuses compared to that of control dams. These findings reveal that expression of the miR-290-295 and miR-371-373 clusters in mice and humans, respectively, is a conserved feature of malignant TGCTs, further validating the mouse model as representative of the human disease. These data also highlight the potential of serum miR-371-373 assays to improve patient outcomes through early TGCT detection, possibly even prenatally.\nSynergistic effects of combing proton- or X-irradiation with anti-PDL1 immunotherapy in two murine oral cancers\nAuthors: Rykkelid, A. M.; Sinha, P. M.; Folefac, C. A.; Horsman, M. R.; Sorensen, B. S.; Soland, T. M.; Schreurs, O. J. F.; Malinen, E.; Edin, N. F. J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557140\nBackground and purpose: Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy may be beneficial in treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), but the combined effect may depend on tumor characteristics and the type of radiation. The purpose was to compare responses for two syngeneic tumor models in mice following X-ray or proton irradiation with or without immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Materials and methods: MOC1 and MOC2 tumors were inoculated in the right hind leg of each mouse (C57BL/6J, n=159). Single-dose irradiation with X-rays or protons and administration of anti-PDL1 started when the tumors reached 200 mm3. Doses of 5-30 Gy were given. Time-dependent tumor volume data were analyzed with a regression model yielding the growth rate {gamma} without irradiation and the reduction in growth rate per dose {eta}. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was calculated as the ratio of {eta} for X-rays to that of protons. Synergy between radiation and ICI was estimated as the ratio of {eta}s. Results: MOC2 tumors grew faster and were more radioresistant than MOC1 tumors. ICI reduced the growth rate for MOC1 with 20{+/-}2% compared to controls, while no reduction was seen for MOC2. RBE for MOC1 wo/w ICI was 0.89{+/-}0.04 and 0.93{+/-}0.06, respectively, while it was 1.15 {+/-}0.12 and 1.60{+/-}0.17, respectively, for MOC2. Combination synergy for X-rays was 1.22{+/-}0.08 and 0.96{+/-}0.11 in MOC1 and MOC2, respectively, while was it 1.27{+/-}0.06 and 1.33{+/-}0.13, respectively, for protons. Conclusions: RBE for protons was dependent on use of ICI and tumor type. A greater synergy may be achieved when combining protons with ICI compared to X-rays and ICI.\nCancer-associated Fibroblast Spatial Heterogeneity and EMILIN1 Expression in Cancer Stroma Modulate TGF-beta Activity and CD8+ T-Cell Infiltration in Breast Cancer\nAuthors: Honda, C.; Kurozumi, S.; Fujii, T.; Pourquier, D.; Khellaf, L.; Boissiere, F.; Horiguchi, J.; Oyama, T.; Shirabe, K.; Colinge, J.; Yokobori, T.; Turtoi, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557312\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) and its multifaceted interactions with cancer cells are major targets for cancer treatment. Single-cell technologies have brought major insights into the TME, but the resulting complexity frequently precludes conclusions on function. Therefore, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to explore the relationship between different cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) populations and immune cell exclusion in breast tumors. Our data show for the first time the degree of spatial organization of different CAF populations in breast cancer. We found that IL-iCAFs, Detox-iCAFs, and IFN-beta-iCAFs tended to cluster together, while Wound-myCAFs, TGF-beta-myCAFs, and ECM-myCAFs formed another group that overlapped with elevated TGF-beta signaling. Differential gene expression analysis of areas with CD8+ T-cell infiltration/exclusion within the TGF-beta signaling-rich zones identified elastin microfibrillar interface protein 1 (EMILIN1) as a top modulated gene. EMILIN1, a TGF-beta inhibitor, was upregulated in IFN-beta-iCAFs directly modulating TGF-beta immunosuppressive function. Histological analysis of 74 breast cancer samples confirmed that high EMILIN-1 expression in the tumor margins was related to high CD8+ T-cell infiltration, consistent with our spatial gene expression analysis. High EMILIN-1 expression was also associated with better prognosis of patients with breast cancer, underscoring its functional significance for the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor area. In conclusion, our data show that correlating TGF-beta signaling to a CAF subpopulation is not enough because proteins with TGF-beta-modulating activity originating from other CAF subpopulations can alter its activity. Therefore, therapeutic targeting should remain focused on biological processes rather than on specific CAF subtypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial pediatric tumor and leads to 15% of all cancer-related deaths in children. Tumor relapse and therapy resistance in neuroblastoma are driven by phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity between noradrenergic (NOR) and mesenchymal (MES) cell states. Despite the importance of this phenotypic plasticity, however, the dynamics and molecular patterns associated with these bidirectional cell-state transitions remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we analyze multiple RNA-seq datasets at both bulk and single-cell resolution, to understand the association between NOR- and MES-specific factors. We observed that NOR-specific and MES-specific expression patterns are largely mutually exclusive, exhibiting a &#34;teams-like&#34; behavior among the genes involved, reminiscent of our earlier observations in lung cancer and melanoma. This antagonism was noticed also in the association of NOR and MES phenotypes with metabolic reprogramming and with immunotherapy targets PD-L1 and GD2, and in experimental perturbations driving the NOR-MES and/or MES-NOR transition. Further, this &#34;teams-like&#34; patterns was seen only among the NOR- and MES-specific genes, but not in housekeeping genes, possibly highlighting a hallmark of network topology enabling cancer cell plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fundamental biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been greatly impacted by the characterization of genetically modified mouse models that allow temporal and spatial activation of oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D). The most commonly used model involves targeted insertion of a cre recombinase into the Ptf1a gene. However, this approach disrupts the Ptf1a gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency that likely affects sensitivity to oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D). The goal of this study was to determine if Ptf1a haploinsufficiency affected the acinar cell response to KRASG12D before and after induction of pancreatic injury. We performed morphological and molecular analysis of three mouse lines that express a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase to activate KRASG12D in acinar cells of the pancreas. The cre-recombinase was targeted to the acinar-specific transcription factor genes, Ptf1a and Mist1/Bhlha15, or expressed within a BAC-derived Elastase transgene. Up to two months after tamoxifen induction of KRASG12D, morphological changes were negligible. However, induction of pancreatic injury by cerulein resulted in stark differences in tissue morphology between lines within seven days, which were maintained for at least five weeks after injury. Ptf1acreERT pancreata showed widespread PanIN lesions and fibrosis, while the Mist1creERT and Ela-creERT models showed reduced amounts of pre-neoplastic lesions. RNA-seq analysis prior to inducing injury suggested Ptf1acreERT and Mist1creERT lines have unique profiles of gene expression that predict a differential response to injury. Multiplex analysis of pancreatic tissue confirmed different inflammatory responses between the lines. These findings suggest understanding the mechanisms underlying the differential response to KRASG12D will help in further defining the intrinsic KRAS-driven mechanisms of neoplasia initiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abstract [N=135]

Mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (mDLC) is a rare histologic subtype of breast cancer displaying both E-cadherin positive ductal and E-cadherin negative lobular morphologies within the same tumor, posing challenges with regard to anticipated clinical management. It remains unclear whether these distinct morphologies also have distinct biology and risk of recurrence. Our spatially-resolved transcriptomic, genomic, and single-cell profiling revealed clinically significant differences between ductal and lobular tumor regions including distinct intrinsic subtype heterogeneity (e.g., mDLC with TNBC/basal ductal and ER&#43;/luminal lobular regions), distinct enrichment of senescence/dormancy and oncogenic (ER and MYC) signatures, genetic and epigenetic CDH1 inactivation in lobular, but not ductal regions, and 4) single-cell ductal and lobular sub-populations with unique oncogenic signatures further highlighting intra-regional heterogeneity. Altogether, we demonstrated that the intra-tumoral morphological/histological heterogeneity within mDLC is underpinned by intrinsic subtype and oncogenic heterogeneity which may result in prognostic uncertainty and therapeutic dilemma.

Significance [N=58]mDLC displays both ductal and lobular tumor regions. Our multi-omic profiling approach revealed that these morphologically distinct tumor regions harbor distinct intrinsic subtypes and oncogenic features that may cause prognostic uncertainty and therapeutic dilemma. Thus histopathological/molecular profiling of individual tumor regions may guide clinical decision making and benefit patients with mDLC, particularly in the advanced setting where there is increased reliance on next generation sequencing.

        <p class="abstract">KRASG12C inhibitors including adagrasib and sortorasib have shown clinical promise in targeting KRASG12C-mutated lung cancers, however, most patients eventually develop drug resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma patients with co-occurring KRASG12C and STK11/LKB1 mutations, we found a high squamous gene signature at baseline significantly correlated with poor adagrasib response. Through integrative studies of Lkb1-deficient KRASG12Cand KrasG12D lung cancer mouse models and/or organoids treated with KRAS inhibitors, we found tumor cells invoked a lineage plasticity program: adeno-to-squamous transition (AST) that mediated resistance to KRAS inhibition. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses revealed {Delta}Np63 drives AST and modulates response to KRAS inhibition. We identified an intermediate high-plasticity cell state with distinct gene expression program marked by Krt6a upregulation. Notably, higher KRT6A expression at baseline correlated with shorter overall survival in KRAS-mutant patients receiving adagrasib. These data support the role of AST in KRAS inhibitor resistance and provide predictive biomarker for KRAS-targeted therapies in lung cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor. Prognosis is poor and survival is low in patients diagnosed with this disease; [~]12% at 5 years. Immunotherapy, including adoptive T cell transfer therapy, has not impacted outcomes in PDAC patients, due in part to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) which limits T cell trafficking and persistence. We posit that murine models serve as useful tools to study the fate of T cell therapy. Currently, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PDAC are considered a &#34;gold-standard&#34; as they recapitulate many aspects of human disease. However, these models have limitations, including marked tumor variability across individual mice and cost of colony maintenance. We characterized the immunologic features and trafficking patterns of adoptively transferred T cells in orthotopic PDAC models using two mouse cell lines, KPC-Luc and MT-5, isolated from KPC-GEMM mouse models (KrasLSL-G12D/&#43;p53-/- and KrasLSL-G12D/&#43;p53LSL-R172H/&#43;, respectively). The MT-5 orthotopic model best recapitulates the cellular and stromal features of the TME in the PDAC GEMM. In contrast, far more host immune cells infiltrate KPC-Luc tumors, which have less stroma. Albeit CD4&#43; T cells were similarly detected in MT-5 tumors compared to KPC-GEMM in mice. Interestingly, we found that CAR T cells redirected to recognize mesothelin on these tumors that signal via CD3{sigma} and 41BB (Meso-41BB{sigma}-CAR T cells) post antigen recognition infiltrated the tumors of mice bearing stroma-devoid KPC-Luc orthotopic tumors, but not MT-5 tumors. Our data establish for the first time a reproducible and realistic clinical system useful for modeling stroma-rich and stroma-devoid PDAC tumors. These models shall serve in-depth study of how to overcome barriers that limit anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) reprogram T cells to recognize and target cancer cells. Despite remarkable responses observed with CAR-T cell therapy in patients with hematological malignancies, CAR-T cell engineering still relies mostly on randomly integrating vectors, limiting the possibilities of fine-tuning T cell function. Here, we designed a CRISPR-based marker-free selection strategy to simultaneously target a therapeutic transgene and a gain-of-function mutation to the MTOR locus to enrich cells resistant to rapamycin, a clinically used immunosuppressant. We readily engineered rapamycin-resistant (RapaR) CAR-T cells by targeting CAR expression cassettes to the MTOR locus. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and a humanized mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that RapaR-CAR-T cells can efficiently target CD19&#43; leukemia cells in presence of rapamycin. Furthermore, our strategy allows multiplexed targeting of rapamycin-regulated immunoreceptors complexes (DARICs) to the MTOR and TRAC loci to pharmacologically control CAR-T cells&#39; activity. We foresee that our approach could both facilitate the enrichment of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells ex vivo and in vivo while improving tumor eradication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveChemotherapy is a crucial treatment strategy for breast cancer (BC), while chemoresistance is a major barrier to BC treatment. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to be involved in chemoresistance. This paper aimed to decipher the mechanism of the miR-4677-3p/LDHB axis in BC drug resistance, with the aim of providing a potential target for drug resistance therapy in BC.

MethodsBioinformatics analysis was used to screen out the target gene. BC drug-resistant cell line MCF-7/paclitaxel (PTX) was established using the drug concentration increment method. miR-4677-3p and LDHB expression levels in MCF-7/PTX cells were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The upstream miRNAs of LDHB were predicted by databases, and a candidate miRNA was obtained by taking the intersection, and verified by dual-luciferase assay. The effects of si-LDHB, miR-4677-3p mimics, or miR-4677-3p mimics &#43; pcDNA3.1-LDHB in MCF-7/PTX cells were determined by CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays.

ResultsLDHB was the most significantly differentially-expressed in the microarray and was highly expressed in BC-resistant cell line. MCF-7/PTX cells upon transfection with si-LDHB exhibited suppressed proliferation, decreased number of colonies, and promoted apoptosis. Subsequently, miR-4677-3p was obtained by predicting the upstream miRNAs of LDHB through multiple databases and taking the intersection. miR-4677-3p targeted LDHB. miR-4677-3p suppressed drug-resistance to PTX in BC cells by down-regulating LDHB. Overexpression of LDHB partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-4677-3p on PTX resistance in BC cells.

ConclusionmiR-4677-3p hindered drug-resistance of BC cells to PTX by down-regulating LDHB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malignant testicular germ cells tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid cancers in young men. Current TGCT diagnostics include conventional serum protein markers, but these lack the sensitivity and specificity to serve as accurate markers across all TGCT subtypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs and informative biomarkers for several diseases. In humans, miRNAs of the miR-371-373 cluster are detectable in the serum of patients with malignant TGCTs and outperform existing serum protein markers for both initial diagnosis and subsequent disease monitoring. We previously developed a genetically engineered mouse model featuring malignant mixed TGCTs consisting of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) and differentiated teratoma that, like the corresponding human malignancies, originate in utero and are highly chemosensitive. Here, we report that miRNAs in the mouse miR-290-295 cluster, homologs of the human miR-371-373 cluster, were detectable in serum from mice with malignant TGCTs but not from tumor-free control mice or mice with benign teratomas. miR-291-293 were expressed and secreted specifically by pluripotent EC cells, and expression was lost following differentiation induced by the drug thioridazine. Notably, miR-291-293 levels were significantly higher in the serum of pregnant dams carrying tumor-bearing fetuses compared to that of control dams. These findings reveal that expression of the miR-290-295 and miR-371-373 clusters in mice and humans, respectively, is a conserved feature of malignant TGCTs, further validating the mouse model as representative of the human disease. These data also highlight the potential of serum miR-371-373 assays to improve patient outcomes through early TGCT detection, possibly even prenatally.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and purpose: Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy may be beneficial in treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), but the combined effect may depend on tumor characteristics and the type of radiation. The purpose was to compare responses for two syngeneic tumor models in mice following X-ray or proton irradiation with or without immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Materials and methods: MOC1 and MOC2 tumors were inoculated in the right hind leg of each mouse (C57BL/6J, n=159). Single-dose irradiation with X-rays or protons and administration of anti-PDL1 started when the tumors reached 200 mm3. Doses of 5-30 Gy were given. Time-dependent tumor volume data were analyzed with a regression model yielding the growth rate {gamma} without irradiation and the reduction in growth rate per dose {eta}. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was calculated as the ratio of {eta} for X-rays to that of protons. Synergy between radiation and ICI was estimated as the ratio of {eta}s. Results: MOC2 tumors grew faster and were more radioresistant than MOC1 tumors. ICI reduced the growth rate for MOC1 with 20{&#43;/-}2% compared to controls, while no reduction was seen for MOC2. RBE for MOC1 wo/w ICI was 0.89{&#43;/-}0.04 and 0.93{&#43;/-}0.06, respectively, while it was 1.15 {&#43;/-}0.12 and 1.60{&#43;/-}0.17, respectively, for MOC2. Combination synergy for X-rays was 1.22{&#43;/-}0.08 and 0.96{&#43;/-}0.11 in MOC1 and MOC2, respectively, while was it 1.27{&#43;/-}0.06 and 1.33{&#43;/-}0.13, respectively, for protons. Conclusions: RBE for protons was dependent on use of ICI and tumor type. A greater synergy may be achieved when combining protons with ICI compared to X-rays and ICI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tumor microenvironment (TME) and its multifaceted interactions with cancer cells are major targets for cancer treatment. Single-cell technologies have brought major insights into the TME, but the resulting complexity frequently precludes conclusions on function. Therefore, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to explore the relationship between different cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) populations and immune cell exclusion in breast tumors. Our data show for the first time the degree of spatial organization of different CAF populations in breast cancer. We found that IL-iCAFs, Detox-iCAFs, and IFN-beta-iCAFs tended to cluster together, while Wound-myCAFs, TGF-beta-myCAFs, and ECM-myCAFs formed another group that overlapped with elevated TGF-beta signaling. Differential gene expression analysis of areas with CD8&#43; T-cell infiltration/exclusion within the TGF-beta signaling-rich zones identified elastin microfibrillar interface protein 1 (EMILIN1) as a top modulated gene. EMILIN1, a TGF-beta inhibitor, was upregulated in IFN-beta-iCAFs directly modulating TGF-beta immunosuppressive function. Histological analysis of 74 breast cancer samples confirmed that high EMILIN-1 expression in the tumor margins was related to high CD8&#43; T-cell infiltration, consistent with our spatial gene expression analysis. High EMILIN-1 expression was also associated with better prognosis of patients with breast cancer, underscoring its functional significance for the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor area. In conclusion, our data show that correlating TGF-beta signaling to a CAF subpopulation is not enough because proteins with TGF-beta-modulating activity originating from other CAF subpopulations can alter its activity. Therefore, therapeutic targeting should remain focused on biological processes rather than on specific CAF subtypes.</p>
