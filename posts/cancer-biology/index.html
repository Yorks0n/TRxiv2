B.; Velds, A.; Bernards, R.; Ciesla, M.\nScore: 225.8, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548685\nProtein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a versatile enzyme affecting many aspects of cellular physiology. However, it remains unclear which of the cellular processes are most perturbed upon PP2A inhibition and how these perturbations could be exploited therapeutically. We report an unanticipated sensitivity of the splicing machinery to phosphorylation changes in response to PP2A inhibition by LB-100 in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observe enrichment for differentially phosphorylated sites within cancer-critical splicing nodes of U2 snRNP, SRSF and hnRNP proteins. Altered phosphorylation endows LB-100-treated colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with differential splicing patterns. In PP2A-inhibited cells, over 1000 events of exon skipping and intron retention affect regulators of genomic integrity. Finally, LB-100-evoked alternative splicing is predicted to be a source of neoantigens that can improve cancer treatment responses to immune modulators. Our findings provide a potential explanation for the pre-clinical and clinical observations that PP2A inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade and genotoxic agents.\nCoordinated inheritance of extrachromosomal DNA species in human cancer cells\nAuthors: Hung, K. L.; Jones, M. G.; Wong, I. T.-L.; Lange, J. T.; Luebeck, J.; Scanu, E.; He, B. J.; Brückner, L.; Li, R.; Gonzalez, R. C.; Schmargon, R.; Dörr, J. R.; Belk, J. A.; Bafna, V.; Werner, B.; Huang, W.; Henssen, A. G.; Mischel, P. S.; Chang, H. Y.\nScore: 31.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549597\nThe chromosomal theory of inheritance has dominated human genetics, including cancer genetics. Genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently, providing a fundamental tenet of Mendelian inheritance. Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a frequent event in cancer that drives oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoral heterogeneity, including through random segregation during cell division. Distinct ecDNA sequences, herein termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells. However, how multiple ecDNA species within a tumor cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations to drive cancer cell evolution is not known. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species can be coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. EcDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy number gains in multiple ecDNA species prior to any selection. Computational modeling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Finally, we show that coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations.\nHATCHet2: clone- and haplotype-specific copy number inference from bulk tumor sequencing data\nAuthors: Myers, M. A.; Arnold, B. J.; Bansal, V.; Mullen, K. M.; Zaccaria, S.; Raphael, B. J.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548855\nMulti-region DNA sequencing of primary tumors and metastases from individual patients helps identify somatic aberrations driving cancer development. However, most methods to infer copy-number aberrations (CNAs) analyze individual samples. We introduce HATCHet2 to identify haplotype- and clone-specific CNAs simultaneously from multiple bulk samples. HATCHet2 introduces a novel statistic, the mirrored haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), to identify mirrored-subclonal CNAs having different numbers of copies of parental haplotypes in different tumor clones. HATCHet2 also has high accuracy in identifying focal CNAs and extends the earlier HATCHet method in several directions. We demonstrate HATCHet2s improved accuracy using simulations and a single-cell sequencing dataset. HATCHet2 analysis of 50 prostate cancer samples from 10 patients reveals previously-unreported mirrored-subclonal CNAs affecting cancer genes.\nIn vivo single-cell CRISPR uncovers distinct TNF-alphaprograms in clonal expansion and tumorigenesis\nAuthors: Renz, P. F.; Ghoshdastider, U.; Baghai Sain, S.; Valdivia-Francia, F.; Khandekar, A.; Ormiston, M.; Bernasconi, M.; Kretz, J. A.; Lee, M.; Hyams, K.; Forny, M.; Pohly, M.; Ficht, X.; Ellis, S. J.; Moor, A. E.; Sendoel, A.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548697\nThe tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions occur frequently in human epithelia and can remodel almost entire tissues, the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing, guide capture and spatial transcriptomics to longitudinally monitor cell type-specific clonal expansions, document their underlying gene programs and contrast clonal expansions from tumor initiation. We uncover a TNF- signaling module that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF- signaling module is downregulated, and instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF- gene program. By analyzing clonally expanded perturbations and their frequency in tumors, we demonstrate that the autocrine TNF- gene program is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is preexistent in a subpopulation of expanded epidermal stem cells, contributing to the predisposition for tumor initiation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the epithelial TNF- gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties of epidermal stem cells and show that the TNF- signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues and unveils distinct TNF- programs in tumor evolution. Understanding the biology of clonal expansions in phenotypically normal epithelia and the mechanisms governing their transformation will guide the development of novel strategies for early cancer detection and therapy.\nA Cell Cycle-Dependent Ferroptosis Sensitivity Switch Governed by EMP2\nAuthors: Rodencal, J.; Kim, N.; Li, V.; He, A.; Lange, M.; He, J.; Tarangelo, A.; Schafer, Z. T.; Olzmann, J.; Sage, J.; Long, J. Z.; Dixon, S. J.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549715\nFerroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis can be induced by system xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter inhibition or by direct inhibition of the phospholipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). The regulation of ferroptosis in response to system xc- inhibition versus direct GPX4 inhibition may be distinct. Here, we show that cell cycle arrest enhances sensitivity to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition but not system xc- inhibition. Arrested cells have increased levels of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids, which drives sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition. Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) expression is reduced upon cell cycle arrest and is sufficient to enhance ferroptosis in response to direct GPX4 inhibition. An orally bioavailable GPX4 inhibitor increased markers of ferroptotic lipid peroxidation in vivo in combination with a cell cycle arresting agent. Thus, responses to different ferroptosis-inducing stimuli can be regulated by cell cycle state.\nEGFR-to-Src family tyrosine kinase switching in proliferating-DTP TNBC cells creates a hyperphosphorylation-dependent vulnerability to EGFR TKI\nAuthors: Chaudhary, N.; Choudhary, B. S.; Shivashankar, A.; Manna, S.; Ved, K.; Shaikh, S. E.; Khanna, S.; Barr, J.; Dani, J.; Verma, N.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549374\nTriple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast malignancy, with chemotherapy as the only mainstay treatment. TNBC patients have the worst prognoses as a large fraction of them do not achieve complete pathological response post-treatment and develop drug-resistant residual disease. Molecular mechanisms that trigger proliferation in drug-resistant chemo-residual TNBC cells are poorly understood due to the lack of investigations using clinically relevant cellular models. In this study, we have established TNBC subtype-specific cellular models of proliferating drug-tolerant persister (PDTP) cells using different classes of chemotherapeutic agents that recapitulate clinical residual disease with molecular heterogeneity. Analysis of total phospho-tyrosine signals in TNBC PDTPs showed an enhanced phospho-tyrosine content compared to the parental cells (PC). Interestingly, using mass-spectrometry analysis, we identified a dramatic decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in the PDTPs, while the presence of hyper-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR compared to PC. Further, we show that EGFR has enhanced lysosomal trafficking in PDTPs with a concomitant increase in N-Myc Downstream Regulated-1 expression that co-localizes with EGFR to mediate receptor degradation. More surprisingly, we found that reduced protein levels of EGFR are coupled with a robust increase in Src family kinases, including Lyn and Fyn kinases, that creates a hyper-phosphorylation state of EGFR-Src tyrosine kinases axis in PDTPs and mediates downstream over-activation of STAT3, AKT and MAP kinases. Moreover, paclitaxel-derived PDTPs show increased sensitivity to EGFR TKI Gefitinib and its combination with paclitaxel selectively induced cell death in PDTP-P TNBC cells and 3D spheroids by strongly downregulating phosphorylation of EGFR-Src with concomitant downregulation of Lyn and Fyn tyrosine kinases. Collectively, this study identifies a unique hyper-phosphorylation cellular state of TNBC PDTPs established by switching of EGFR-Src family tyrosine kinases creating a vulnerability to EGFR TKI.\nIntestinal LKB1 loss drives a pre-malignant program along the serrated cancer pathway\nAuthors: Plugge, S. F.; Ma, H.; van der Vaart, J. Y.; Sprangers, J.; Morsink, F. H. M.; Xanthakis, D.; Jamieson, C.; Keijzer, A. R.; Margaritis, T.; Candelli, T.; Straver, R.; de Ridder, J.; Holstege, F. C. P.; de Leng, W. W. J.; Offerhaus, G. J. A.; Merenda, A.; Maurice, M. M.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.548873\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a familial disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) mutations that promote gastrointestinal polyposis and enhance cancer susceptibility. How LKB1-deficiency alters the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues to mediate increased cancer risk remains poorly understood. Here, we employ small intestinal organoids to investigate these issues for heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1 epithelial loss. We show that Lkb1 loss causes an allele dosage-dependent activation of a transcriptional program for tissue repair that is already induced in stem cell populations and mediates alterations in secretory cell type morphology and positioning. Furthermore, this shift towards a regenerative state omits the need for EGF supplementation, thus inducing niche-independent properties. Strikingly, we uncover that heterozygous loss of Lkb1 is sufficient to push the epithelium into a premalignant program for colorectal carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or Kras mutations. We conclude that persistent upregulation of a regenerative program due to LKB1 loss alters cellular hierarchy and induces niche independency, which predisposes PJS epithelium to uncontrolled growth along the serrated pathway.\nIntegrative spatial analysis reveals a multi-layered organization of glioblastoma\nAuthors: Greenwald, A.

L.; Tirosh, I.\nScore: 82.3, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547924\nGlioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Hypoxic regions are associated with a unique histology of pseudopalisading cells, while other regions appear to have limited histological organization, reflecting the diffuse nature of glioma cells. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics with spatial proteomics and novel computational approaches to define glioma cellular states at high granularity and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of cellular organization. First, cells in any given state tend to be spatially clustered, such that tumors are composed of small local environments that are each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. Despite the unique composition of each tumor, this pairing of states remains largely consistent across tumors. Third, the pairwise interactions that we detect collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive this 5-layered organization, as it is both associated with unique states of surrounding cells and with a long-range organization that extends from the hypoxic core to the infiltrative edge of the tumor. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of gliomas at the resolution of cellular states and highlight the role of hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.\nCRISPR/Cas9 screenings unearth protein arginine methyltransferase 7 as a novel driver of metastasis in prostate cancer\nAuthors: Rodrigo-Faus, M.; Vincelle-Nieto, A.; Vidal, N.; Puente, J.; Saiz-Pardo, M.; Lopez-Garcia, A.; Mendiburu-Elicabe, M.; Palao, N.; Baquero, C.; Cuesta, A. M.; Qu, H.-Q.; Hakonarson, H.; Musteanu, M.; Reyes-Palomares, A.; Porras, A.; Bragado, P.; Gutierrez-Uzquiza, A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549704\nOwing to the inefficacy of available treatments, the survival rate of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is severely decreased. Therefore, it is crucial to identify new therapeutic targets to increase the survival of mPCa patients. This study aim was to identify the most relevant regulators of mPCa onset by performing two high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screenings. Furthermore, some of the top hits were validated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, with protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) being the best candidate. Its inhibition or depletion via CRISPR significantly reduced mPCa cell capacities in vitro. Furthermore, PRMT7 ablation reduced mPCa appearance in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse xenograft assays. Molecularly, PRMT7 reprograms the expression of several adhesion molecules through methylation of several transcription factors, such as FoxK1 or NR1H2, which results in primary tumor PCa cell adhesion loss and motility gain. Moreover, PRMT7 is upregulated in advanced stages of Spanish PCa tumor samples and PRMT7 pharmacological inhibition reduces the dissemination of mPCa cells. Thus, here is shown that PRMT7 is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker of mPCa.\nTranscriptional regulation of Dyskerin via canonical WNT signaling modulates sphingolipid biosynthesis and drives colorectal cancer.\nAuthors: Nigam, S.; Khan, U. K.; Praveen, A.; Shendre, A.; Carskadon, S.; Kapoor, A.; Tewari, A.; Chandra, A.; Palanisamy, N.; Ateeq, B.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549480\nTargeting EGFR has been effective in RAS/RAF wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, residual tumor relapses, necessitating the importance of biomarker-guided novel therapeutics. We show elevated DKC1 in [~]88% of CRC patients with poor recurrence-free survival. Clinically, DKC1-positive patients exhibit similarity with CMS2 class, the canonical subtype with active WNT signaling. We show functional significance of DKC1 in cell proliferation, stemness, DNA repair, and survival. Further, mice bearing DKC1 knockdown xenografts show [~]81% reduction in tumor burden. Mechanistically, WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling orchestrates DKC1 expression, then, DKC1/SOX2 complex regulates SGPP2, modulating sphingolipids metabolism. Downregulation of DKC1 in CRC lead to reduced SGPP2 levels leading to dysregulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Of note, DKC1-high CRC patients show accumulation of ceramides, namely C23 and C24, signifying their utility in diagnosis. Collectively, we delineate the mechanistic circuitry involved in DKC1-mediated CRC progression, propose ceramides as biomarker, and underscore WNT-based therapeutics for DKC1-positive patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a versatile enzyme affecting many aspects of cellular physiology. However, it remains unclear which of the cellular processes are most perturbed upon PP2A inhibition and how these perturbations could be exploited therapeutically. We report an unanticipated sensitivity of the splicing machinery to phosphorylation changes in response to PP2A inhibition by LB-100 in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observe enrichment for differentially phosphorylated sites within cancer-critical splicing nodes of U2 snRNP, SRSF and hnRNP proteins. Altered phosphorylation endows LB-100-treated colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with differential splicing patterns. In PP2A-inhibited cells, over 1000 events of exon skipping and intron retention affect regulators of genomic integrity. Finally, LB-100-evoked alternative splicing is predicted to be a source of neoantigens that can improve cancer treatment responses to immune modulators. Our findings provide a potential explanation for the pre-clinical and clinical observations that PP2A inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade and genotoxic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The chromosomal theory of inheritance has dominated human genetics, including cancer genetics. Genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently, providing a fundamental tenet of Mendelian inheritance. Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a frequent event in cancer that drives oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoral heterogeneity, including through random segregation during cell division. Distinct ecDNA sequences, herein termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells. However, how multiple ecDNA species within a tumor cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations to drive cancer cell evolution is not known. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species can be coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. EcDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy number gains in multiple ecDNA species prior to any selection. Computational modeling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Finally, we show that coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multi-region DNA sequencing of primary tumors and metastases from individual patients helps identify somatic aberrations driving cancer development. However, most methods to infer copy-number aberrations (CNAs) analyze individual samples. We introduce HATCHet2 to identify haplotype- and clone-specific CNAs simultaneously from multiple bulk samples. HATCHet2 introduces a novel statistic, the mirrored haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), to identify mirrored-subclonal CNAs having different numbers of copies of parental haplotypes in different tumor clones. HATCHet2 also has high accuracy in identifying focal CNAs and extends the earlier HATCHet method in several directions. We demonstrate HATCHet2s improved accuracy using simulations and a single-cell sequencing dataset. HATCHet2 analysis of 50 prostate cancer samples from 10 patients reveals previously-unreported mirrored-subclonal CNAs affecting cancer genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions occur frequently in human epithelia and can remodel almost entire tissues, the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing, guide capture and spatial transcriptomics to longitudinally monitor cell type-specific clonal expansions, document their underlying gene programs and contrast clonal expansions from tumor initiation. We uncover a TNF- signaling module that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF- signaling module is downregulated, and instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF- gene program. By analyzing clonally expanded perturbations and their frequency in tumors, we demonstrate that the autocrine TNF- gene program is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is preexistent in a subpopulation of expanded epidermal stem cells, contributing to the predisposition for tumor initiation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the epithelial TNF- gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties of epidermal stem cells and show that the TNF- signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues and unveils distinct TNF- programs in tumor evolution. Understanding the biology of clonal expansions in phenotypically normal epithelia and the mechanisms governing their transformation will guide the development of novel strategies for early cancer detection and therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis can be induced by system xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter inhibition or by direct inhibition of the phospholipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). The regulation of ferroptosis in response to system xc- inhibition versus direct GPX4 inhibition may be distinct. Here, we show that cell cycle arrest enhances sensitivity to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition but not system xc- inhibition. Arrested cells have increased levels of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids, which drives sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition. Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) expression is reduced upon cell cycle arrest and is sufficient to enhance ferroptosis in response to direct GPX4 inhibition. An orally bioavailable GPX4 inhibitor increased markers of ferroptotic lipid peroxidation in vivo in combination with a cell cycle arresting agent. Thus, responses to different ferroptosis-inducing stimuli can be regulated by cell cycle state.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast malignancy, with chemotherapy as the only mainstay treatment. TNBC patients have the worst prognoses as a large fraction of them do not achieve complete pathological response post-treatment and develop drug-resistant residual disease. Molecular mechanisms that trigger proliferation in drug-resistant chemo-residual TNBC cells are poorly understood due to the lack of investigations using clinically relevant cellular models. In this study, we have established TNBC subtype-specific cellular models of proliferating drug-tolerant persister (PDTP) cells using different classes of chemotherapeutic agents that recapitulate clinical residual disease with molecular heterogeneity. Analysis of total phospho-tyrosine signals in TNBC PDTPs showed an enhanced phospho-tyrosine content compared to the parental cells (PC). Interestingly, using mass-spectrometry analysis, we identified a dramatic decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in the PDTPs, while the presence of hyper-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR compared to PC. Further, we show that EGFR has enhanced lysosomal trafficking in PDTPs with a concomitant increase in N-Myc Downstream Regulated-1 expression that co-localizes with EGFR to mediate receptor degradation. More surprisingly, we found that reduced protein levels of EGFR are coupled with a robust increase in Src family kinases, including Lyn and Fyn kinases, that creates a hyper-phosphorylation state of EGFR-Src tyrosine kinases axis in PDTPs and mediates downstream over-activation of STAT3, AKT and MAP kinases. Moreover, paclitaxel-derived PDTPs show increased sensitivity to EGFR TKI Gefitinib and its combination with paclitaxel selectively induced cell death in PDTP-P TNBC cells and 3D spheroids by strongly downregulating phosphorylation of EGFR-Src with concomitant downregulation of Lyn and Fyn tyrosine kinases. Collectively, this study identifies a unique hyper-phosphorylation cellular state of TNBC PDTPs established by switching of EGFR-Src family tyrosine kinases creating a vulnerability to EGFR TKI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a familial disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) mutations that promote gastrointestinal polyposis and enhance cancer susceptibility. How LKB1-deficiency alters the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues to mediate increased cancer risk remains poorly understood. Here, we employ small intestinal organoids to investigate these issues for heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1 epithelial loss. We show that Lkb1 loss causes an allele dosage-dependent activation of a transcriptional program for tissue repair that is already induced in stem cell populations and mediates alterations in secretory cell type morphology and positioning. Furthermore, this shift towards a regenerative state omits the need for EGF supplementation, thus inducing niche-independent properties. Strikingly, we uncover that heterozygous loss of Lkb1 is sufficient to push the epithelium into a premalignant program for colorectal carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or Kras mutations. We conclude that persistent upregulation of a regenerative program due to LKB1 loss alters cellular hierarchy and induces niche independency, which predisposes PJS epithelium to uncontrolled growth along the serrated pathway.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Hypoxic regions are associated with a unique histology of pseudopalisading cells, while other regions appear to have limited histological organization, reflecting the diffuse nature of glioma cells. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics with spatial proteomics and novel computational approaches to define glioma cellular states at high granularity and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of cellular organization. First, cells in any given state tend to be spatially clustered, such that tumors are composed of small local environments that are each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. Despite the unique composition of each tumor, this pairing of states remains largely consistent across tumors. Third, the pairwise interactions that we detect collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive this 5-layered organization, as it is both associated with unique states of surrounding cells and with a long-range organization that extends from the hypoxic core to the infiltrative edge of the tumor. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of gliomas at the resolution of cellular states and highlight the role of hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Owing to the inefficacy of available treatments, the survival rate of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is severely decreased. Therefore, it is crucial to identify new therapeutic targets to increase the survival of mPCa patients. This study aim was to identify the most relevant regulators of mPCa onset by performing two high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screenings. Furthermore, some of the top hits were validated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, with protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) being the best candidate. Its inhibition or depletion via CRISPR significantly reduced mPCa cell capacities in vitro. Furthermore, PRMT7 ablation reduced mPCa appearance in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse xenograft assays. Molecularly, PRMT7 reprograms the expression of several adhesion molecules through methylation of several transcription factors, such as FoxK1 or NR1H2, which results in primary tumor PCa cell adhesion loss and motility gain. Moreover, PRMT7 is upregulated in advanced stages of Spanish PCa tumor samples and PRMT7 pharmacological inhibition reduces the dissemination of mPCa cells. Thus, here is shown that PRMT7 is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker of mPCa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting EGFR has been effective in RAS/RAF wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, residual tumor relapses, necessitating the importance of biomarker-guided novel therapeutics. We show elevated DKC1 in [~]88% of CRC patients with poor recurrence-free survival. Clinically, DKC1-positive patients exhibit similarity with CMS2 class, the canonical subtype with active WNT signaling. We show functional significance of DKC1 in cell proliferation, stemness, DNA repair, and survival. Further, mice bearing DKC1 knockdown xenografts show [~]81% reduction in tumor burden. Mechanistically, WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling orchestrates DKC1 expression, then, DKC1/SOX2 complex regulates SGPP2, modulating sphingolipids metabolism. Downregulation of DKC1 in CRC lead to reduced SGPP2 levels leading to dysregulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Of note, DKC1-high CRC patients show accumulation of ceramides, namely C23 and C24, signifying their utility in diagnosis. Collectively, we delineate the mechanistic circuitry involved in DKC1-mediated CRC progression, propose ceramides as biomarker, and underscore WNT-based therapeutics for DKC1-positive patients.</p>
