C.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571566\nCellular plasticity is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) starting from the conversion of normal cells to precancerous lesions to the progression of carcinoma subtypes associated with aggressiveness and therapeutic response. We found that normal acinar cell differentiation, maintained by the transcription factor Pdx1, suppresses a broad gastric cell identity that is maintained in metaplasia, neoplasia, and the classical subtype of PDAC. We have identified the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 as marker of a gastric metaplasia (SPEM)-like identity. Ablation of Ror2 in a mouse model of pancreatic tumorigenesis promoted a switch to a gastric pit cell identity that was largely persistent upon progression to carcinoma. In both human and mouse pancreatic cancer, ROR2 activity continued to antagonize the gastric pit cell identity, strongly promoting an epithelial mesenchymal transition, conferring resistance to KRAS inhibition, and vulnerability to AKT inhibition.\nPreleukemic clonal evolution revealed using single-cell DNA sequencing and computational modelling\nAuthors: Blundell, J. R.; Poon, G. Y. P.; Vedi, A.; Laurenti, E.; Sanders, M. A.; Valk, P.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571872\nThe acquisition of cancer driver mutations can predate diagnosis by decades. However, our understanding of the evolution that occurs in these early stages of cancer remains limited because most studies focus only on sequencing the malignant clone that \"wins\" the evolutionary race. The representation of driver mutations in the stem cells which do not transform into the malignant clone provides a window into this precancerous evolution. Here, we isolate preleukemic haematopoietic stem cells (pHSCs) from the bone marrow of 16 patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and perform single-cell DNA sequencing on thousands of pHSCs to reconstruct phylogenetic trees for the preleukemic evolution in each patient. In the majority of cases AML required the acquisition of 3 or 4 driver mutations in the same cell lineage. However the reconstructed phylogenetic trees are highly variable across the 16 patients. The structure of the trees and the sizes of intermediate preleukemic clones encode important information about the roles of selection, mutation and genetic drift operating during precancerous evolution. Using simulations and machine learning approaches, we show that the highly variable patterns observed in pHSC trees emerge naturally from a model of somatic evolution in which there is strong positive selection acting throughout the entire multi-hit trajectory towards AML. We infer that the acquisition of each driver mutation provides an additional selective advantage of [~] 15% per year to pHSC clones relative to their immediate ancestors. Using these inferred levels of positive selection we show that individuals destined to develop AML late in life are likely to harbour multiple-mutant clones that have arisen anomalously early in life. Our findings suggest that the identification of a single HSC carrying 2 driver mutations in early adulthood may provide a rational strategy to identify individuals at high risk of AML progression.\nA compendium of Amplification-Related Gain Of Sensitivity (ARGOS) genes in human cancer\nAuthors: Rendo, V.; Schubert, M.; Khuu, N.; Suarez Peredo Rodriguez, M. F.; Huang, K.; Swift, M.; He, Y.; Zerbib, J.; Smith, R.; Raaijmakers, J.; Bandopadhayay, P.; Guenther, L. M.; Hwang, J. H.; Iniguez, A.; Moody, S.; Seo, J.-H.; Stover, E.; Garraway, L.; Hahn, W. C.; Stegmaier, K.; Medema, R. H.; Chowdhury, D.; Colome-Tatche, M.; Ben-David, U.; Beroukhim, R.; Foijer, F.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.571980\nChromosomal gains are among the most frequent somatic genetic alterations occurring in cancer. While the effect of sustained oncogene expression has been characterized, the impact of copy-number gains affecting collaterally-amplified \"bystander\" genes on cellular fitness remains less understood. To investigate this, we built a comprehensive map of dosage compensations across human cancers by integrating expression and copy number profiles from over 8,000 TCGA tumors and CCLE cell lines. Further, we analyzed the effect of gene overexpression across 17 human cancer ORF screens to provide an overview of genes that prove toxic to cancer cells when overexpressed. Combining these two independent approaches we propose a class of Amplification-Related Gain Of Sensitivity (ARGOS) genes. These genes are located in commonly amplified regions of the genome, have lower expression levels than expected by their copy-number status, and are toxic to cancer cells when overexpressed. We experimentally validated CDKN1A and RBM14 as high-confidence pan-cancer ARGOS genes in lung and breast cancer cell line models. We additionally suggest that RBM14s mechanism of toxicity involves altered DNA damage response and innate immune signaling processes following gene overexpression. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of compensated, toxic, and ARGOS genes as a community resource.\nDistinct host preconditioning regimens differentially impact the antitumor potency of adoptively transferred Th17 cells.\nAuthors: Wittling, M. C.; Knochelmann, H. M.; Wyatt, M. M.; Rangel Rivera, G. O.; Cole, A. C.; Lesinski, G. B.; Paulos, C. M.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572179\nBackgroundMechanisms by which distinct methods of host preconditioning impact the efficacy of adoptively transferred antitumor T helper cells is unknown. MethodsCD4+ T cells with a transgenic TCR that recognize TRP-1 melanoma antigen were polarized to the T helper 17 (Th17) phenotype and then transferred into melanoma-bearing mice preconditioned with either total body irradiation or chemotherapy. ResultsWe found that preconditioning mice with a non-myeloablative dose of total body irradiation (TBI of 5 Gy) was more effective than using an equivalently dosed non-myeloablative chemotherapy (CTX at 200 mg/kg) at augmenting therapeutic activity of anti-tumor TRP-1 Th17 cells. Anti-tumor Th17 cells engrafted better following preconditioning with TBI and regressed large established melanoma in all animals. Conversely, only half of mice survived long-term when preconditioned with CTX and infused with anti-melanoma Th17 cells. IL-17 and IFN-g produced by the infused Th17 cells, were detected in animals given either TBI or CTX preconditioning. Interestingly, inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-5, and KC) were significantly elevated in the serum of mice preconditioned with TBI versus CTX after Th17 therapy. ConclusionsOur results indicate, for the first time, that the antitumor response, persistence, and cytokine profiles resulting from Th17 therapy are impacted by the specific regimen of host preconditioning. This work is important for understanding mechanisms that promote long-lived responses by ACT, particularly as CD4+ based T cell therapies are now emerging in the clinic.\nThree-dimensional assessments are necessary to determine the true spatial tissue composition of diseased tissues\nAuthors: Forjaz, A.; Vaz, E.; Romero, V. M.; Joshi, S.; Braxton, A. M.; Jiang, A. C.; Fujikura, K.; Cornish, T.; Hong, S.-M.; Hruban, R. H.; Wu, P.-H.; Wood, L. D.; Kiemen, A. L.; Wirtz, D.\nScore: 37.1, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569986\nMethods for partially resolved cellular profiling has enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping via thinly cut sections to study inter-patient and intra-patient differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited spatial regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the 3D microanatomy of surgically resected human pancreas biospecimens obtained from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. To compare differences in the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, we assessed the bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition of a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs), and a cohort of 3D serially sectioned and reconstructed tissues of pancreata. Here, we show the strength of using 3D as the gold standard, by measuring the information loss and sampling problems when using WSIs and TMAs. We demonstrate that spatial correlation in microanatomical tissue content decays significantly within a span of just a few microns within tumors. As a corollary, hundreds of TMAs and tens of WSIs are required to estimate spatial bulk tumor composition with \u003c10% error in any given pancreatic tumor. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tumor burden and tissue composition. These preliminary results show the importance of rate of sampling necessary to more reliably assess spatially resolved tissue composition.\nLarge pan-cancer cell screen coupled to (phospho-) proteomics underscores high-dose vitamin C as a potent anti-cancer agent\nAuthors: Valles Marti, A.; Böttger, F.; Yau, E.; Tejjani, K.; Meijs, L.; Sharma, S.; Mumtaz, M.; Le Large, T.; Erozenci, A.; Dekker, D.; Schelfhorst, T.; Medema, J. P.; Bijnsdorp, I. V.; Knol, J. C.; Piersma, S. R.; Pham, T. V.; Giovannetti, E.; Jimenez, C. R.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572293\nIncreasing preclinical and clinical evidence has positioned high-dose vitamin C as a promising anti-cancer treatment that merits more clinical attention. Multiple cytotoxicity mechanisms have been described, including pro-oxidant effects. To contribute to the preclinical understanding of the broad pan-cancer effects of high-dose vitamin C in a global manner, we determined the IC50 of a large panel of cancer cell lines (n=51) representing 7 solid tumour types and generated proteome data. The majority of cell lines were highly sensitive (IC50 range 0.036-10mM, mean 1.7 {+/-} 0.4 mM), well below a clinically achievable dose. The proteome data (\u003e5000 proteins per sample), showed that high sensitivity is associated with proliferation, as indicated by functional enrichment of cell cycle, RNA splicing and chromatin organization, while lower sensitivity is linked to extracellular vesicles, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and mitochondria. Moreover, (phospho-)proteome analysis of on-treatment vitamin C effects on four pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells dosed at a range of IC50 values (Hs766 T, 2 mM; Capan-2, 0.6 mM; PANC-1, 0.14 mM and Suit-2, 0.1 mM) revealed, next to cell line specific effects, down-modulation of AKT-MTOR signalling and immune suppressive signalling, while IFN- response was enhanced upon vitamin C. Altogether, our comprehensive pharmacological and (phospho-)proteome analysis is the first to assess cancer vulnerabilities and effects of vitamin C on a large cancer cell line panel and underscores the potential of high-dose vitamin C as an anti-cancer agent.\nThe Exon Junction Complex component EIF4A3 plays a splicing-linked oncogenic role in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\nAuthors: Blazquez-Encinas, R.; Alors-Perez, E.; Moreno-Montilla, M. T.; Garcia-Vioque, V.; Sanchez-Frias, M. E.; Mafficini, A.; Lopez-Canovas, J. L.; Bousquet, C.; Gahete, M. D.; Lawlor, R. T.; Luque, R. M.; Scarpa, A.; Arjona-Sanchez, A.; Pedraza-Arevalo, S.; Ibanez-Costa, A.; Castano, J. P.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570542\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide and further research on its biology is needed to fully understand the disease. Dysregulation of alternative RNA splicing is a common hallmark in cancer, including PDAC, which provides an emerging source of knowledge and of novel biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Here, we examined the role of EIF4A3, a core component of the Exon Junction Complex intimately linked to RNA splicing, in pancreatic cancer biology. EIF4A3 is overexpressed in PDAC tissue and associated to clinical parameters of malignancy and poorer patient survival. Mechanistically, exploration of PDAC RNA-seq data unveiled the link of EIF4A3 to diverse malignancy processes, in line with its association to key molecular pathways. Accordingly, EIF4A3 targeting in vitro decreased essential functional tumor features such as proliferation, migration, colony formation and sphere formation, while its in vivo targeting reduced tumor growth. EIF4A3 silencing in PDAC cell lines severely altered its transcriptional and spliceosomic landscapes, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, suggesting a role for EIF4A3 in maintaining RNA homeostasis. Our results indicate that EIF4A3 dysregulation in PDAC has a pleiotropic regulatory role on RNA biology, influencing key cellular functions. This paves the way to explore its potential as a novel biomarker and actionable target candidate for this lethal cancer.\nComprehensive chromatome profiling identifies metabolic enzymes on chromatin in healthy and cancer cells\nAuthors: Kourtis, S.; Guirola, M.; Pardo-Lorente, N.; Ghose, R.; Garcia-Cao, M.; Ganez-Zapater, A.; Haynes, S.; Fontaine, F.; Muller, A.; Sdelci, S.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570368\nMetabolic and epigenetic rewiring are widely considered hallmarks of cancer, with emerging evidence of crosstalk between them. Anecdotal evidence of metabolic enzymes moonlighting in the chromatin environment has suggested how this crosstalk might be facilitated, but the extent of nuclear relocalization of metabolic enzymes remains elusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive chromatin proteomics resource across cancer lineages as well as healthy samples and demonstrate that metabolic enzyme moonlighting on chromatin is widespread across tissues and pathways. We show that the abundance of metabolic enzymes on chromatin is tissue-specific, with oxidative phosphorylation proteins depleted in lung cancer samples, perhaps suggesting an interplay between cell identity and nuclear metabolism. Finally, we explore metabolic functions in the chromatin environment and show that one-carbon folate enzymes are associated with DNA damage and repair processes, providing an approach to explore non-canonical functions of metabolic enzymes.\nCell Types or Cell States? An Investigation of Adrenergic and Mesenchymal Cell Phenotypes in Neuroblastoma\nAuthors: Bukkuri, A.; Andersson, S.; Brown, J. S.; Hammarlund, E. U.; Mohlin, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572368\nNeuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that exhibits two cellular phenotypes: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). ADRN is differentiated and therapy-sensitive, while MES is less differentiated with elevated therapy resistance. To understand neuroblastoma and its treatment response, it is important to elucidate how these phenotypes impact the eco-evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations and whether they represent distinct cell types or dynamic cell states. Here, we show that neuroblastoma cells undergo an ADRN to a MES phenotypic switch under chemotherapy treatment. We use a strong inference approach to generate four hypotheses on how this switch may occur: cell types without resistance, cell types with resistance, cell states without resistance, and cell states with resistance. For each of these hypotheses, we create theoretical models to make qualitative predictions about their resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results provide a framework to further experimentally determine whether ADRN and MES phenotypes are distinct cell types or dynamic cell states.\nMelanoma innervation is associated with cancer progression in a zebrafish xenograft model\nAuthors: LORENZINI, F.; MARINES, J.; Le FRIEC, J.; DO KHOA, N.; NIETO, M. A.; SANCHEZ-LAORDEN, B.; MIONE, M.; FONTENILLE, L.; KISSA, K.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571512\nThe peripheral nervous system has a key role in regulating tumour biology in different types of cancer. Here, by modelling aggressive melanoma in larval zebrafish xenografts, we highlight the dynamics of tumour innervation in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Axonogenesis and dendritogenesis are detected in the motoneurons surrounding the melanoma niche and neurogenesis is observed in the nearby population of the enteric nervous system. We also demonstrate the crucial role of catecholamines in promoting melanoma progression, supporting in vivo cancer cell dissemination and invasion. This zebrafish model will allow to uncover neural markers associated with melanoma progression to help in the design of innovative anti-neurogenic therapies targeting specifically the neuronal signals that regulate melanoma progression.

        <p class="abstract">Cellular plasticity is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) starting from the conversion of normal cells to precancerous lesions to the progression of carcinoma subtypes associated with aggressiveness and therapeutic response. We found that normal acinar cell differentiation, maintained by the transcription factor Pdx1, suppresses a broad gastric cell identity that is maintained in metaplasia, neoplasia, and the classical subtype of PDAC. We have identified the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 as marker of a gastric metaplasia (SPEM)-like identity. Ablation of Ror2 in a mouse model of pancreatic tumorigenesis promoted a switch to a gastric pit cell identity that was largely persistent upon progression to carcinoma. In both human and mouse pancreatic cancer, ROR2 activity continued to antagonize the gastric pit cell identity, strongly promoting an epithelial mesenchymal transition, conferring resistance to KRAS inhibition, and vulnerability to AKT inhibition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The acquisition of cancer driver mutations can predate diagnosis by decades. However, our understanding of the evolution that occurs in these early stages of cancer remains limited because most studies focus only on sequencing the malignant clone that &#34;wins&#34; the evolutionary race. The representation of driver mutations in the stem cells which do not transform into the malignant clone provides a window into this precancerous evolution. Here, we isolate preleukemic haematopoietic stem cells (pHSCs) from the bone marrow of 16 patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and perform single-cell DNA sequencing on thousands of pHSCs to reconstruct phylogenetic trees for the preleukemic evolution in each patient. In the majority of cases AML required the acquisition of 3 or 4 driver mutations in the same cell lineage. However the reconstructed phylogenetic trees are highly variable across the 16 patients. The structure of the trees and the sizes of intermediate preleukemic clones encode important information about the roles of selection, mutation and genetic drift operating during precancerous evolution. Using simulations and machine learning approaches, we show that the highly variable patterns observed in pHSC trees emerge naturally from a model of somatic evolution in which there is strong positive selection acting throughout the entire multi-hit trajectory towards AML. We infer that the acquisition of each driver mutation provides an additional selective advantage of [~] 15% per year to pHSC clones relative to their immediate ancestors. Using these inferred levels of positive selection we show that individuals destined to develop AML late in life are likely to harbour multiple-mutant clones that have arisen anomalously early in life. Our findings suggest that the identification of a single HSC carrying 2 driver mutations in early adulthood may provide a rational strategy to identify individuals at high risk of AML progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromosomal gains are among the most frequent somatic genetic alterations occurring in cancer. While the effect of sustained oncogene expression has been characterized, the impact of copy-number gains affecting collaterally-amplified &#34;bystander&#34; genes on cellular fitness remains less understood. To investigate this, we built a comprehensive map of dosage compensations across human cancers by integrating expression and copy number profiles from over 8,000 TCGA tumors and CCLE cell lines. Further, we analyzed the effect of gene overexpression across 17 human cancer ORF screens to provide an overview of genes that prove toxic to cancer cells when overexpressed. Combining these two independent approaches we propose a class of  Amplification-Related Gain Of Sensitivity (ARGOS) genes. These genes are located in commonly amplified regions of the genome, have lower expression levels than expected by their copy-number status, and are toxic to cancer cells when overexpressed. We experimentally validated CDKN1A and RBM14 as high-confidence pan-cancer ARGOS genes in lung and breast cancer cell line models. We additionally suggest that RBM14s mechanism of toxicity involves altered DNA damage response and innate immune signaling processes following gene overexpression. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of compensated, toxic, and ARGOS genes as a community resource.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanisms by which distinct methods of host preconditioning impact the efficacy of adoptively transferred antitumor T helper cells is unknown.

MethodsCD4&#43; T cells with a transgenic TCR that recognize TRP-1 melanoma antigen were polarized to the T helper 17 (Th17) phenotype and then transferred into melanoma-bearing mice preconditioned with either total body irradiation or chemotherapy.

ResultsWe found that preconditioning mice with a non-myeloablative dose of total body irradiation (TBI of 5 Gy) was more effective than using an equivalently dosed non-myeloablative chemotherapy (CTX at 200 mg/kg) at augmenting therapeutic activity of anti-tumor TRP-1 Th17 cells. Anti-tumor Th17 cells engrafted better following preconditioning with TBI and regressed large established melanoma in all animals. Conversely, only half of mice survived long-term when preconditioned with CTX and infused with anti-melanoma Th17 cells. IL-17 and IFN-g produced by the infused Th17 cells, were detected in animals given either TBI or CTX preconditioning. Interestingly, inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-5, and KC) were significantly elevated in the serum of mice preconditioned with TBI versus CTX after Th17 therapy.

ConclusionsOur results indicate, for the first time, that the antitumor response, persistence, and cytokine profiles resulting from Th17 therapy are impacted by the specific regimen of host preconditioning. This work is important for understanding mechanisms that promote long-lived responses by ACT, particularly as CD4&#43; based T cell therapies are now emerging in the clinic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Methods for partially resolved cellular profiling has enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping via thinly cut sections to study inter-patient and intra-patient differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited spatial regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the 3D microanatomy of surgically resected human pancreas biospecimens obtained from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. To compare differences in the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, we assessed the bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition of a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs), and a cohort of 3D serially sectioned and reconstructed tissues of pancreata. Here, we show the strength of using 3D as the gold standard, by measuring the information loss and sampling problems when using WSIs and TMAs. We demonstrate that spatial correlation in microanatomical tissue content decays significantly within a span of just a few microns within tumors. As a corollary, hundreds of TMAs and tens of WSIs are required to estimate spatial bulk tumor composition with &lt;10% error in any given pancreatic tumor. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tumor burden and tissue composition. These preliminary results show the importance of rate of sampling necessary to more reliably assess spatially resolved tissue composition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence has positioned high-dose vitamin C as a promising anti-cancer treatment that merits more clinical attention. Multiple cytotoxicity mechanisms have been described, including pro-oxidant effects. To contribute to the preclinical understanding of the broad pan-cancer effects of high-dose vitamin C in a global manner, we determined the IC50 of a large panel of cancer cell lines (n=51) representing 7 solid tumour types and generated proteome data. The majority of cell lines were highly sensitive (IC50 range 0.036-10mM, mean 1.7 {&#43;/-} 0.4 mM), well below a clinically achievable dose. The proteome data (&gt;5000 proteins per sample), showed that high sensitivity is associated with proliferation, as indicated by functional enrichment of cell cycle, RNA splicing and chromatin organization, while lower sensitivity is linked to extracellular vesicles, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and mitochondria. Moreover, (phospho-)proteome analysis of on-treatment vitamin C effects on four pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells dosed at a range of IC50 values (Hs766 T, 2 mM; Capan-2, 0.6 mM; PANC-1, 0.14 mM and Suit-2, 0.1 mM) revealed, next to cell line specific effects, down-modulation of AKT-MTOR signalling and immune suppressive signalling, while IFN- response was enhanced upon vitamin C. Altogether, our comprehensive pharmacological and (phospho-)proteome analysis is the first to assess cancer vulnerabilities and effects of vitamin C on a large cancer cell line panel and underscores the potential of high-dose vitamin C as an anti-cancer agent.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide and further research on its biology is needed to fully understand the disease. Dysregulation of alternative RNA splicing is a common hallmark in cancer, including PDAC, which provides an emerging source of knowledge and of novel biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Here, we examined the role of EIF4A3, a core component of the Exon Junction Complex intimately linked to RNA splicing, in pancreatic cancer biology. EIF4A3 is overexpressed in PDAC tissue and associated to clinical parameters of malignancy and poorer patient survival. Mechanistically, exploration of PDAC RNA-seq data unveiled the link of EIF4A3 to diverse malignancy processes, in line with its association to key molecular pathways. Accordingly, EIF4A3 targeting in vitro decreased essential functional tumor features such as proliferation, migration, colony formation and sphere formation, while its in vivo targeting reduced tumor growth. EIF4A3 silencing in PDAC cell lines severely altered its transcriptional and spliceosomic landscapes, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, suggesting a role for EIF4A3 in maintaining RNA homeostasis. Our results indicate that EIF4A3 dysregulation in PDAC has a pleiotropic regulatory role on RNA biology, influencing key cellular functions. This paves the way to explore its potential as a novel biomarker and actionable target candidate for this lethal cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic and epigenetic rewiring are widely considered hallmarks of cancer, with emerging evidence of crosstalk between them. Anecdotal evidence of metabolic enzymes moonlighting in the chromatin environment has suggested how this crosstalk might be facilitated, but the extent of nuclear relocalization of metabolic enzymes remains elusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive chromatin proteomics resource across cancer lineages as well as healthy samples and demonstrate that metabolic enzyme moonlighting on chromatin is widespread across tissues and pathways. We show that the abundance of metabolic enzymes on chromatin is tissue-specific, with oxidative phosphorylation proteins depleted in lung cancer samples, perhaps suggesting an interplay between cell identity and nuclear metabolism. Finally, we explore metabolic functions in the chromatin environment and show that one-carbon folate enzymes are associated with DNA damage and repair processes, providing an approach to explore non-canonical functions of metabolic enzymes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that exhibits two cellular phenotypes: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). ADRN is differentiated and therapy-sensitive, while MES is less differentiated with elevated therapy resistance. To understand neuroblastoma and its treatment response, it is important to elucidate how these phenotypes impact the eco-evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations and whether they represent distinct cell types or dynamic cell states. Here, we show that neuroblastoma cells undergo an ADRN to a MES phenotypic switch under chemotherapy treatment. We use a strong inference approach to generate four hypotheses on how this switch may occur: cell types without resistance, cell types with resistance, cell states without resistance, and cell states with resistance. For each of these hypotheses, we create theoretical models to make qualitative predictions about their resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results provide a framework to further experimentally determine whether ADRN and MES phenotypes are distinct cell types or dynamic cell states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The peripheral nervous system has a key role in regulating tumour biology in different types of cancer. Here, by modelling aggressive melanoma in larval zebrafish xenografts, we highlight the dynamics of tumour innervation in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Axonogenesis and dendritogenesis are detected in the motoneurons surrounding the melanoma niche and neurogenesis is observed in the nearby population of the enteric nervous system. We also demonstrate the crucial role of catecholamines in promoting melanoma progression, supporting in vivo cancer cell dissemination and invasion. This zebrafish model will allow to uncover neural markers associated with melanoma progression to help in the design of innovative anti-neurogenic therapies targeting specifically the neuronal signals that regulate melanoma progression.
