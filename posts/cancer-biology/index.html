Here, we explored the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) for therapeutic targeting of KRAS mutation-driven tumorigenesis. EVs loaded with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against KRAS successfully inhibited tumor xenograft growth when injected intratumorally in mice models. Intriguingly, when injected intravenously, EVs were still able to accumulate in tumors and deliver KRAS targeting siRNA payload in sufficient amount to show tumor growth inhibition. Therefore, EV-siRNA platform show great promises for therapeutic targeting of KRAS mutations and other undruggable targets.\nPersister cancer cells are characterized by H4K20me3 heterochromatin that defines a low inflammatory profile\nAuthors: Ramponi, V.; Richart, L.; Kovatcheva, M.; Stephan-Otto Attolini, C.; Capellades, J.; Lord, A. E.; Yanes, O.; Ficz, G.; Serrano, M.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577389\nAnti-cancer therapies may induce proliferative arrest in cancer cells in the form of senescence or drug-tolerant persistency, the latter being a reversible arrest with similarities to embryonic diapause. Here, we use mTOR/PI3K inhibition to develop and characterize a model of persistency/diapause-like arrest in human cancer cells of various origins. We show that persister and senescent cancer cells share an expanded lysosomal compartment and hypersensitivity to BCL-XL inhibition. However, persister cells do not exhibit other features of senescence, such as the loss of Lamin B1, senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity, and an inflammatory phenotype. Compared to senescent cells, persister cells have a profoundly diminished senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), low activation of interferon signaling pathways and lack upregulation of MHC-I presentation. Based on a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen performed in diapause mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we discover that persister human cancer cells are hypersensitive to the inhibition of one-carbon metabolism. This finding led us to uncover that the repressive heterochromatic mark H4K20me3 is enriched at promoters of SASP and interferon response genes in persister cells, but not in senescent cells. Collectively, we define novel features and vulnerabilities of persister cancer cells and we provide insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying their low inflammatory and immunogenic activity.\nThree-dimensional assessments are necessary to determine the true, spatially-resolved composition of tissues\nAuthors: Forjaz, A.; Vaz, E.; Romero, V. M.; Joshi, S.; Braxton, A. M.; Jiang, A. C.; Fujikura, K.; Cornish, T.; Hong, S.-M.; Hruban, R. H.; Wu, P.-H.; Wood, L. D.; Kiemen, A. L.; Wirtz, D.\nScore: 45.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569986\nMethods for spatially resolved cellular profiling using thinly cut sections have enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping to study inter-sample and intra-sample differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) microanatomy of grossly normal and cancer-containing human pancreas biospecimens obtained from individuals who underwent pancreatic resection. To compare inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity, we assessed bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition in a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs) and a cohort of thick slabs of pancreas tissue that were digitally reconstructed in 3D from serial sections. To demonstrate the marked under sampling of 2D assessments, we simulated the number of WSIs and tissue microarrays (TMAs) necessary to represent the compositional heterogeneity of 3D data within 10% error to reveal that tens of WSIs and hundreds of TMA cores are sometimes needed. We show that spatial correlation of different pancreatic structures decay significantly within a span of microns, demonstrating that 2D histological sections may not be representative of their neighboring tissues. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tissue composition in normal and abnormal specimens and in order to accurately determine neoplastic content. These results emphasize the importance of intra-sample heterogeneity in tissue mapping efforts.\nHypoxia-induced Complement Component 3 Promotes Aggressive Tumor Growth in the Glioblastoma Microenvironment\nAuthors: Rosberg, R.; Smolag, K. I.; Sjolund, J.; Johansson, E.; Bergelin, C.; Wahlden, J.; Pantazopoulou, V.; Ceberg, C.; Pietras, K.; Blom, A. M.; Pietras, A.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577617\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of glioma with a high rate of relapse despite intensive treatment. Tumor recurrence is tightly linked to radio-resistance, which in turn is associated with hypoxia. Here, we discovered a strong link between hypoxia and local complement signaling using publicly available bulk, single cell, and spatially resolved transcriptomic data from human GBM patients. Complement component 3 (C3) and the receptor C3AR1 were both associated with aggressive disease and shorter survival in human glioma. In a genetically engineered mouse model of GBM, we found C3 specifically in hypoxic tumor areas. In vitro, we found an oxygen level-dependent increase in C3 and C3AR1 expression in response to hypoxia in several GBM and stromal cell types. Presence of C3 increased proliferation of GBM cells under hypoxic conditions, as well as clonal survival of GBM cells following radiation. Targeting C3aR using the antagonist SB290157 decreased GBM cell self-renewal in vitro, and prolonged survival of glioma bearing mice both alone and in combination with radiotherapy while reducing the number of M2-polarized macrophages. Our findings establish a strong link between hypoxia and complement pathways in GBM, and support a role of hypoxia-induced C3a-C3aR signaling as a contributor to glioma aggressiveness.\nUpregulated cholesterol biosynthesis facilitates the survival of methylation-retaining AML cells following decitabine treatment.\nAuthors: Bond, D. R.; Burnard, S. M.; Uddipto, K.; Hunt, K. V.; Harvey, B. M.; Steffens Reinhardt, L.; Lawlor-O'Neill, C.; Roper, E. A.; Humphries, S.; Murray, H. C.; Bowden, N. A.; Enjeti, A. K.; Verrills, N. M.; Riveros, C.; Le Cao, K.-A.; Lee, H. J.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577864\nDNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplasia patients who are unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy, but low response rates and therapy-resistant relapse remain significant challenges. To optimise HMA efficacy, we must understand how resistance and relapse arise from cells that survive treatment. Here we combine single-cell multi-omic analysis with parallel colony-forming assays to link HMA-induced molecular heterogeneity with functional consequences in AML cells. HMAs, azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC), induced global epigenetic heterogeneity associated with upregulation of inflammatory responses and cell death pathways in a subset of hypomethylated cells. Some AML cells maintained high DNA methylation during treatment, and these methylation-retaining cells had increased self-renewal capacity following DAC, but not AZA. Molecular profiling of individual colonies revealed upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis as an adaptation to HMA treatment, and inhibition by rosuvastatin enhanced DAC effects in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HMA-induced heterogeneity has important implications for AML cell growth and statins are a candidate co-treatment strategy to delay or prevent HMA-resistant relapse.\nHuman IL-6 fosters long-term engraftment of patient derived disease-driving myeloma cells in immunodeficient mice\nAuthors: Hasanali, Z. S.; Garfall, A.; Burzenski, L.; Shultz, L.; Tang, Y.; Kadu, S.; Sheppard, N.; Dopkin, D.; Vogl, D. T.; Cohen, A. D.; Waxman, A. J.; Susanibar-Adaniya, S.; Carroll, M.; Stadtmauer, E.; Allman, D. M.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576547\nMultiple myeloma is a largely incurable and life-threatening malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma cells. An effective and widely available animal model that recapitulates human myeloma and related plasma cell disorders is lacking. We show that busulfan-conditioned hIL-6 transgenic NSG mice (NSG+hIL6) reliably support the engraftment of malignant and pre-malignant human plasma cells including from patients diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, pre- and post-relapse myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, and AL amyloidosis. Consistent with human disease, NSG+hIL6 mice engrafted with patient-derived myeloma cells, developed serum M spikes, and a majority developed anemia, hypercalcemia, and/or bone lesions. Single cell RNA sequencing showed non-malignant and malignant cell engraftment, the latter expressing a wide array of mRNAs associated with myeloma cell survival and proliferation. Myeloma engrafted mice given CAR T-cells targeting plasma cells or bortezomib experienced reduced tumor burden. Our results establish NSG+hIL6 mice as an effective patient derived xenograft model for study and preclinical drug development of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders.\nSomatic gene delivery for flexible in vivo modeling of high-risk sarcoma\nAuthors: Imle, R.; Blosel, D.; Kommoss, F.; Zhao, E.; Autry, R.; Blume, C.; Lupar, D.; Schmitt, L.; Winter, C.; Wagner, L.; Placke, S.; von Eicke, M.; Hertwig, M.; Peterziel, H.; Oehme, I.; Scheuerman, S.; Seitz, C.; Geyer, F.; Cidre-Aranaz, F.; Grunewald, T.; Vokuhl, C.; Chudasama, P.; Scholl, C.; Schmidt, C.; Gunther, P.; Sill, M.; Jones, K.; Pfister, S.; Banito, A.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577924\nA particular challenge hampering therapeutic advancements for high-risk sarcoma patients is the broad spectrum of molecularly distinct sarcoma entities and the corresponding lack of suitable model systems to recapitulate and study these diseases. To overcome this predicament, we developed a novel genetically-controlled, yet versatile mouse modeling platform allowing delivery of different genetic lesions by electroporation (EPO) of the thigh muscle wildtype mice. This optimized sarcoma EPO-GEMM (EPO-based genetically engineered mouse model) platform allowed the generation of ten biologically distinct sarcoma entities, including Synovial Sarcoma (SS), fusion-positive and fusion-negative Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) and Infantile Fibrosarcoma (IFS). Comprehensive molecular profiling and cross-species analyses confirmed faithful recapitulation of the human disease, including the expression of relevant immunotherapy targets. Syngeneic allografting enabled reliable preservation and scalability of Sarcoma-EPO-GEMMs for treatment trials, such as B7-H3-directed CAR-T cell therapy in an immunocompetent background.\nIncreased interaction between connexin43 and microtubules is critical for glioblastoma stem-like cell maintenance and tumorigenicity.\nAuthors: Smyth, J. W.; Guo, S.; O'Rourke, L.; Deaver, S.; Dahlka, J.; Nurmemmedov, E.; Sheng, Z.; Gourdie, R. G.; Lamouille, S.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.576347\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system. One major challenge in GBM treatment is the resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy observed in subpopulations of cancer cells, including GBM stem-like cells (GSCs). These cells hold the ability to self-renew or differentiate following treatment, participating in tumor recurrence. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) has complex roles in oncogenesis and we have previously demonstrated an association between Cx43 and GBM chemotherapy resistance. Here, we report, for the first time, increased direct interaction between non-junctional Cx43 with microtubules in the cytoplasm of GSCs. We hypothesize that non-junctional Cx43/microtubule complexing is critical for GSC maintenance and survival and sought to specifically disrupt this interaction while maintaining other Cx43 functions, such as gap junction formation. Using a Cx43 mimetic peptide of the carboxyl terminal tubulin-binding domain of Cx43 (JM2), we successfully ablated Cx43 interaction with microtubules in GSCs. Importantly, administration of JM2 significantly decreased GSC survival in vitro, and limited GSC-derived tumor growth in vivo. Together, these results identify JM2 as a novel peptide drug to ablate GSCs in GBM treatment.\nDeciphering the diversity and sequence of extracellular matrix and cellular spatial patterns in lung adenocarcinoma using topological data analysis\nAuthors: Yoon, I. H. R.; Jenkins, R.; Colliver, E.; Zhang, H.; Novo, D.; Moore, D.; Ramsden, Z.; Rullan, A.; Fu, X.; Yuan, Y.; Harrington, H. A.; Swanton, C.; Byrne, H. M.; Sahai, E.\nScore: 38.1, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574362\nExtracellular matrix (ECM) organization influences cancer development and progression. It modulates the invasion of cancer cells and can hinder the access of immune cells to cancer cells. Effective quantification of ECM architecture and its relationship to the position of different cell types is, therefore, important when investigating the role of ECM in cancer development. Using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly persistent homology and Dowker persistent homology, we develop a novel analysis pipeline for quantifying ECM architecture, spatial patterns of cell positions, and the spatial relationships between distinct constituents of the tumour microenvironment. We apply the pipeline to 44 surgical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from the lung TRACERx study stained with picrosirius red and haematoxylin. We show that persistent homology effectively encodes the architectural features of the tumour microenvironment. Inference using pseudo-time analysis and spatial mapping to centimetre scale tissues suggests a gradual and progressive route of change in ECM architecture, with two different end states. Dowker persistent homology enables the analysis of spatial relationship between any pair of constituents of the tumour microenvironment, such as ECM, cancer cells, and leukocytes. We use Dowker persistent homology to quantify the spatial segregation of cancer and immune cells over different length scales. A combined analysis of both topological and non-topological features of the tumour microenvironment indicates that progressive changes in the ECM are linked to increased immune exclusion and reduced oxidative metabolism.\nAccelerated Hematopoietic Stem Cell Aging in Space\nAuthors: Pham, J.; Isquith, J.; Balaian, L.; Ladel, L.; Nandi, S. P.; Mack, K.; van der Werf, I.; Klacking, E.; Ruiz, A.; Mays, D.; Gamble, P.; Giza, S.; Janowitz, J.; Nienaber, T.; Mishra, T.; Kulidjian, A.; Stoudemire, J.; Snyder, M. P.; Clements, T.; Muotri, A. R.; Morris, S. R.; Whisenant, T.; Alexandrov, L. B.; Jamieson, C. H. M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577076\nStem cell aging is accelerated by macroenvironmental and microenvironmental stressors, including inflammation. Previously, the NASA Twins study revealed inflammatory cytokine upregulation, chromosomal alterations, and telomere changes suggestive of accelerated aging in low-Earth orbit (LEO). To investigate the effects of spaceflight on human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) aging, the NASA-supported Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research team performed four independent 30- to 45-day NASA missions with matched flight and ground HSPC nanobioreactors in automated CubeLabs. These experiments revealed loss of HSPC dormancy, reduced self-renewal capacity, mitochondrial DNA amplification, APOBEC3-induced C-to-T mutagenesis, reduced ADAR1p150 expression, and alterations in the expression of repetitive elements. These molecular changes are indicative of accelerated HSPC aging and pre-leukemia stem cell generation in space and may be predictable and preventable.\n",

        <p class="abstract">RAS is a well-known oncogene contributing to significant proportion of cancer incidences, yet it remains as an undruggable target to majority of therapeutic modalities. Here, we explored the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) for therapeutic targeting of KRAS mutation-driven tumorigenesis. EVs loaded with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against KRAS successfully inhibited tumor xenograft growth when injected intratumorally in mice models. Intriguingly, when injected intravenously, EVs were still able to accumulate in tumors and deliver KRAS targeting siRNA payload in sufficient amount to show tumor growth inhibition. Therefore, EV-siRNA platform show great promises for therapeutic targeting of KRAS mutations and other undruggable targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anti-cancer therapies may induce proliferative arrest in cancer cells in the form of senescence or drug-tolerant persistency, the latter being a reversible arrest with similarities to embryonic diapause. Here, we use mTOR/PI3K inhibition to develop and characterize a model of persistency/diapause-like arrest in human cancer cells of various origins. We show that persister and senescent cancer cells share an expanded lysosomal compartment and hypersensitivity to BCL-XL inhibition. However, persister cells do not exhibit other features of senescence, such as the loss of Lamin B1, senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity, and an inflammatory phenotype. Compared to senescent cells, persister cells have a profoundly diminished senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), low activation of interferon signaling pathways and lack upregulation of MHC-I presentation. Based on a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen performed in diapause mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we discover that persister human cancer cells are hypersensitive to the inhibition of one-carbon metabolism. This finding led us to uncover that the repressive heterochromatic mark H4K20me3 is enriched at promoters of SASP and interferon response genes in persister cells, but not in senescent cells. Collectively, we define novel features and vulnerabilities of persister cancer cells and we provide insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying their low inflammatory and immunogenic activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Methods for spatially resolved cellular profiling using thinly cut sections have enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping to study inter-sample and intra-sample differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) microanatomy of grossly normal and cancer-containing human pancreas biospecimens obtained from individuals who underwent pancreatic resection. To compare inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity, we assessed bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition in a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs) and a cohort of thick slabs of pancreas tissue that were digitally reconstructed in 3D from serial sections. To demonstrate the marked under sampling of 2D assessments, we simulated the number of WSIs and tissue microarrays (TMAs) necessary to represent the compositional heterogeneity of 3D data within 10% error to reveal that tens of WSIs and hundreds of TMA cores are sometimes needed. We show that spatial correlation of different pancreatic structures decay significantly within a span of microns, demonstrating that 2D histological sections may not be representative of their neighboring tissues. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tissue composition in normal and abnormal specimens and in order to accurately determine neoplastic content. These results emphasize the importance of intra-sample heterogeneity in tissue mapping efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of glioma with a high rate of relapse despite intensive treatment. Tumor recurrence is tightly linked to radio-resistance, which in turn is associated with hypoxia. Here, we discovered a strong link between hypoxia and local complement signaling using publicly available bulk, single cell, and spatially resolved transcriptomic data from human GBM patients. Complement component 3 (C3) and the receptor C3AR1 were both associated with aggressive disease and shorter survival in human glioma. In a genetically engineered mouse model of GBM, we found C3 specifically in hypoxic tumor areas. In vitro, we found an oxygen level-dependent increase in C3 and C3AR1 expression in response to hypoxia in several GBM and stromal cell types. Presence of C3 increased proliferation of GBM cells under hypoxic conditions, as well as clonal survival of GBM cells following radiation. Targeting C3aR using the antagonist SB290157 decreased GBM cell self-renewal in vitro, and prolonged survival of glioma bearing mice both alone and in combination with radiotherapy while reducing the number of M2-polarized macrophages. Our findings establish a strong link between hypoxia and complement pathways in GBM, and support a role of hypoxia-induced C3a-C3aR signaling as a contributor to glioma aggressiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplasia patients who are unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy, but low response rates and therapy-resistant relapse remain significant challenges. To optimise HMA efficacy, we must understand how resistance and relapse arise from cells that survive treatment. Here we combine single-cell multi-omic analysis with parallel colony-forming assays to link HMA-induced molecular heterogeneity with functional consequences in AML cells. HMAs, azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC), induced global epigenetic heterogeneity associated with upregulation of inflammatory responses and cell death pathways in a subset of hypomethylated cells. Some AML cells maintained high DNA methylation during treatment, and these methylation-retaining cells had increased self-renewal capacity following DAC, but not AZA. Molecular profiling of individual colonies revealed upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis as an adaptation to HMA treatment, and inhibition by rosuvastatin enhanced DAC effects in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HMA-induced heterogeneity has important implications for AML cell growth and statins are a candidate co-treatment strategy to delay or prevent HMA-resistant relapse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiple myeloma is a largely incurable and life-threatening malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma cells. An effective and widely available animal model that recapitulates human myeloma and related plasma cell disorders is lacking. We show that busulfan-conditioned hIL-6 transgenic NSG mice (NSG&#43;hIL6) reliably support the engraftment of malignant and pre-malignant human plasma cells including from patients diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, pre- and post-relapse myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, and AL amyloidosis. Consistent with human disease, NSG&#43;hIL6 mice engrafted with patient-derived myeloma cells, developed serum M spikes, and a majority developed anemia, hypercalcemia, and/or bone lesions. Single cell RNA sequencing showed non-malignant and malignant cell engraftment, the latter expressing a wide array of mRNAs associated with myeloma cell survival and proliferation. Myeloma engrafted mice given CAR T-cells targeting plasma cells or bortezomib experienced reduced tumor burden. Our results establish NSG&#43;hIL6 mice as an effective patient derived xenograft model for study and preclinical drug development of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A particular challenge hampering therapeutic advancements for high-risk sarcoma patients is the broad spectrum of molecularly distinct sarcoma entities and the corresponding lack of suitable model systems to recapitulate and study these diseases. To overcome this predicament, we developed a novel genetically-controlled, yet versatile mouse modeling platform allowing delivery of different genetic lesions by electroporation (EPO) of the thigh muscle wildtype mice. This optimized sarcoma EPO-GEMM (EPO-based genetically engineered mouse model) platform allowed the generation of ten biologically distinct sarcoma entities, including Synovial Sarcoma (SS), fusion-positive and fusion-negative Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) and Infantile Fibrosarcoma (IFS). Comprehensive molecular profiling and cross-species analyses confirmed faithful recapitulation of the human disease, including the expression of relevant immunotherapy targets. Syngeneic allografting enabled reliable preservation and scalability of Sarcoma-EPO-GEMMs for treatment trials, such as B7-H3-directed CAR-T cell therapy in an immunocompetent background.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system. One major challenge in GBM treatment is the resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy observed in subpopulations of cancer cells, including GBM stem-like cells (GSCs). These cells hold the ability to self-renew or differentiate following treatment, participating in tumor recurrence. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) has complex roles in oncogenesis and we have previously demonstrated an association between Cx43 and GBM chemotherapy resistance. Here, we report, for the first time, increased direct interaction between non-junctional Cx43 with microtubules in the cytoplasm of GSCs. We hypothesize that non-junctional Cx43/microtubule complexing is critical for GSC maintenance and survival and sought to specifically disrupt this interaction while maintaining other Cx43 functions, such as gap junction formation. Using a Cx43 mimetic peptide of the carboxyl terminal tubulin-binding domain of Cx43 (JM2), we successfully ablated Cx43 interaction with microtubules in GSCs. Importantly, administration of JM2 significantly decreased GSC survival in vitro, and limited GSC-derived tumor growth in vivo. Together, these results identify JM2 as a novel peptide drug to ablate GSCs in GBM treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extracellular matrix (ECM) organization influences cancer development and progression. It modulates the invasion of cancer cells and can hinder the access of immune cells to cancer cells. Effective quantification of ECM architecture and its relationship to the position of different cell types is, therefore, important when investigating the role of ECM in cancer development. Using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly persistent homology and Dowker persistent homology, we develop a novel analysis pipeline for quantifying ECM architecture, spatial patterns of cell positions, and the spatial relationships between distinct constituents of the tumour microenvironment. We apply the pipeline to 44 surgical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from the lung TRACERx study stained with picrosirius red and haematoxylin. We show that persistent homology effectively encodes the architectural features of the tumour microenvironment. Inference using pseudo-time analysis and spatial mapping to centimetre scale tissues suggests a gradual and progressive route of change in ECM architecture, with two different end states. Dowker persistent homology enables the analysis of spatial relationship between any pair of constituents of the tumour microenvironment, such as ECM, cancer cells, and leukocytes. We use Dowker persistent homology to quantify the spatial segregation of cancer and immune cells over different length scales. A combined analysis of both topological and non-topological features of the tumour microenvironment indicates that progressive changes in the ECM are linked to increased immune exclusion and reduced oxidative metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem cell aging is accelerated by macroenvironmental and microenvironmental stressors, including inflammation. Previously, the NASA Twins study revealed inflammatory cytokine upregulation, chromosomal alterations, and telomere changes suggestive of accelerated aging in low-Earth orbit (LEO). To investigate the effects of spaceflight on human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) aging, the NASA-supported Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research team performed four independent 30- to 45-day NASA missions with matched flight and ground HSPC nanobioreactors in automated CubeLabs. These experiments revealed loss of HSPC dormancy, reduced self-renewal capacity, mitochondrial DNA amplification, APOBEC3-induced C-to-T mutagenesis, reduced ADAR1p150 expression, and alterations in the expression of repetitive elements. These molecular changes are indicative of accelerated HSPC aging and pre-leukemia stem cell generation in space and may be predictable and preventable.</p>
