It is also unclear whether any direct synaptic communication between neurons and cancer cells of non-neural tumor types exists, and if so, whether this can support metastasis and thus cancer progression. Here we show that excitatory synapses are formed between neurons and brain-metastatic melanoma and breast cancer cells. This starts at an early microscopic stage after extravasation into the brain parenchyma, during residence of cancer cells in the perivascular niche, a critical step for their survival. These neuron-cancer synapses showed a bona fide synaptic ultrastructure, and generated excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype in cancer cells. In accordance, AMPA receptor signatures were consistently detected in preclinical and patient samples of melanoma and breast cancer brain metastases. Genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of AMPA receptors with the approved antiepileptic drug perampanel in models of breast and melanoma cancer reduced the number of brain metastases and overall brain metastatic burden. These findings demonstrate for the first time that neurons can form biologically relevant direct synapses with non-neural cancer cells. In brain metastasis, a particularly challenging complication of many common malignancies, this non-canonical stimulatory synaptic interaction offers novel therapeutic opportunities.\nPCTA, A PAN-CANCER CELL LINE TRANSCRIPTOME ATLAS\nAuthors: Cheng, S.; Li, L.; Yu, X.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575087\nBackgroundA substantial volume of RNA sequencing data were generated from cancer cell lines. However, it requires specific bioinformatics skills to compare gene expression levels across cell lines. This has hindered non-bioinformaticians from fully utilizing these valuable datasets in their research. To bridge this gap, we established a curated Pan-cancer Cell Line Transcriptome Atlas (PCTA) dataset. This resource aims to provide a user-friendly platform, allowing researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise to access and leverage the wealth of information within the dataset for their studies. Importantly, PCTA stands out by offering sufficient sample numbers per cell line in comparison to other pan-cancer datasets. MethodsCell lines meta data and RNA sequencing data were retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), SRA and ARCHS4 databases. Utilizing the programming language R, we conducted data retrieval, normalization, and visualization. Only expression data for protein-coding genes and long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were considered in this study, streamlining the focus to enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis. ResultsThe resulting PCTA dataset encompasses the expression matrix of 24,965 genes, featuring data from 84,385 samples derived from 5,677 studies. This comprehensive compilation spans 535 cell lines, representing a spectrum of 114 cancer types originating from 30 diverse tissue types. On UMAP plots, cell lines originating from the same type of tissue tend to cluster together, illustrating the datasets ability to capture biological relationships. To unravel molecular signatures, marker genes were identified for each cancer type. Additionally, an interactive and user-friendly web application (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/PCTA_app/) was developed for researchers to explore the PCTA dataset. This platform allows users to examine the expression pattern of their genes of interest across a diverse array of samples. Data are visualized as violin-, box-, and point-plots, enhancing the interpretability of the findings. ConclusionThe PCTA stands as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into gene expression patterns across diverse cancer cell lines and providing a valuable tool to explore molecular signatures and potential therapeutic targets in cancer research.\nInternalisation of integrin-bound extracellular matrix modulates invasive carcinoma cell migration\nAuthors: Llanses Martinez, M.; Nan, K.; Bao, Z.; Bacchetti, R.; Yuan, S.; Tyler, J.; Le Guezennec, X.; Bard, F. A.; Rainero, E.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575153\nThe interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. Here we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38{beta}), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound 2{beta}1 integrin. Furthermore, 2{beta}1 integrin was necessary for macropinocytosis of soluble dextran, identifying it as a novel and targetable regulator of macropinocytosis in cancer. Moreover, disruption of 2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11 and PP2R1A-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Finally, 2{beta}1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly upregulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A and 2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the 2{beta}1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression.\nDivergent trajectories to structural diversity impact patient survival in high grade serous ovarian cancer\nAuthors: Ewing, A.; Meynert, A.; Silk, R.; Aitken, S.; Bendixsen, D.

C.; McNeish, I. A.; Biankin, A. V.; Roxburgh, P.; Gourley, C.; Semple, C. A.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575376\nDeciphering the structural variation across tumour genomes is crucial to determine the events driving tumour progression and better understand tumour adaptation and evolution. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an exemplar tumour type showing extreme, but poorly characterised structural diversity. We comprehensively describe the mutational landscape driving HGSOC, exploiting a large (N=324), deeply whole genome sequenced dataset. We reveal two divergent evolutionary trajectories, affecting patient survival and involving differing genomic environments. One involves homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) while the other is dominated by whole genome duplication (WGD) with frequent chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridges and extra-chromosomal DNA. These trajectories contribute to structural variation hotspots, containing novel candidate driver genes with significantly altered expression. While structural variation predominantly drives tumorigenesis, we also find high mtDNA mutation loads associated with shorter patient survival, and acting in combination with alterations in the nuclear genome to impact prognosis and suggesting new strategies for patient stratification.\nPulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) reduces the tumor-promoting responses induced by conventional chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts\nAuthors: Franco-Barraza, J.; Luong, T.; Wong, J. K.; Raghavan, K.; Handroff, E.; Vendramini-Costa, D. B.; Francescone, R.; Gardiner, J. C.; Meyer, J. E.; Cukierman, E.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575510\nPancreatic cancer is becoming increasingly deadly, with treatment options limited due to, among others, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This short communications study investigates pulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) as a potential alternative to conventional radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer neoadjuvant treatment. Our ex vivo research demonstrates that PLDR, in combination with chemotherapy, promotes a shift from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing properties in a key component of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment we called CAFu (cancer-associated fibroblasts and self-generated extracellular matrix functional units). This beneficial effect translates to reduced desmoplasia (fibrous tumor expansion) and suggests PLDR's potential to improve total neoadjuvant therapy effectiveness. To comprehensively assess this functional shift, we developed the HOST-Factor, a single score integrating multiple biomarkers. This tool provides a more accurate picture of CAFu function compared to individual biomarkers and could be valuable for guiding and monitoring future therapeutic strategies. Our findings support the ongoing NCT04452357 clinical trial testing PLDR safety and TME normalization potential in pancreatic cancer patients. The HOST-Factor will be used in samples collected from this trial to validate its potential as a key tool for personalized medicine in this aggressive disease.\nSignaling events at TMEM doorways provide potential targets for inhibiting breast cancer dissemination\nAuthors: Surve, C. R.; Duran, C. L.; Ye, X.; Chen, X.; Lin, Y.; Harney, A. S.; Wang, Y.; Sharma, V. P.; Stanley, E. R.; McAuliffe, J. C.; Entenberg, D.; Oktay, M. H.; Condeelis, J. S.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574676\nTumor cell intravasation is essential for metastatic dissemination, but its exact mechanism is incompletely understood. We have previously shown that in breast cancer, the direct and stable association of a tumor cell expressing Mena, a Tie2hi/Vegfhi macrophage, and a vascular endothelial cell, creates an intravasation portal, called a \"tumor microenvironment of metastasis\" (TMEM) doorway, for tumor cell intravasation, leading to dissemination to distant sites. The density of TMEM doorways, also called TMEM doorway score, is a clinically validated prognostic marker of distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. Although we know that tumor cells utilize TMEM doorway-associated transient vascular openings to intravasate, the precise signaling mechanisms involved in TMEM doorway function are only partially understood. Using two mouse models of breast cancer and an in vitro assay of intravasation, we report that CSF-1 secreted by the TMEM doorway tumor cell stimulates local secretion of VEGF-A from the Tie2hi TMEM doorway macrophage, leading to the dissociation of endothelial junctions between TMEM doorway associated endothelial cells, supporting tumor cell intravasation. Acute blockage of CSF-1R signaling decreases macrophage VEGF secretion as well as TMEM doorway-associated vascular opening, tumor cell trans-endothelial migration, and dissemination. These new insights into signaling events regulating TMEM doorway function should be explored further as treatment strategies for metastatic disease.\nFluorescence Lifetime Imaging for quantification of targeted drug delivery in varying tumor microenvironments\nAuthors: Verma, A.; Pandey, V.; Sherry, C.; James, C.; Matteson, K.; Smith, J. T.; Rudkouskaya, A.; Intes, X.; Barroso, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575453\nRationale: Trastuzumab (TZM) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) and is clinically used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast tumors. However, the tumor microenvironment can limit the access of TZM to the HER2 targets across the whole tumor and thereby compromise TZMs therapeutic efficacy. An imaging methodology that can non-invasively quantify the binding of TZM-HER2, which is required for therapeutic action, and distribution within tumors with varying tumor microenvironments is much needed. Methods: We performed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence lifetime (FLI) Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to measure TZM-HER2 binding, using in vitro microscopy and in vivo widefield macroscopy, in HER2 overexpressing breast and ovarian cancer cells and tumor xenografts, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate in vivo imaging results. Results: NIR FLI FRET in vitro microscopy data show variations in intracellular distribution of bound TZM in HER2-positive breast AU565 and AU565 tumor-passaged XTM cell lines in comparison to SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. Macroscopy FLI (MFLI) FRET in vivo imaging data show that SKOV-3 tumors display reduced TZM binding compared to AU565 and XTM tumors, as validated by ex vivo immunohistochemistry. Moreover, AU565/XTM and SKOV-3 tumor xenografts display different amounts and distributions of TME components, such as collagen and vascularity. Therefore, these results suggest that SKOV-3 tumors are refractory to TZM delivery due to their disrupted vasculature and increased collagen content. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that FLI is a powerful analytical tool to monitor the delivery of antibody drug tumor both in cell cultures and in vivo live systems. Especially, MFLI FRET is a unique imaging modality that can directly quantify target engagement with potential to elucidate the role of the TME in drug delivery efficacy in intact live tumor xenografts.\nReprogramming neuroblastoma by diet-enhanced polyamine depletion\nAuthors: Cherkaoui, S.; Yang, L.; McBride, M. J.; Turn, C.; Lu, W.; Eigenmann, C.; Allen, G. E.; Panasenko, O. O.; Zhang, L.; Vu, A.; Liu, K.; Li, Y.; Gandhi, O. H.; Surrey, L.; Wierer, M.; White, E.; Rabinowitz, J. D.; Hogarty, M. D.; Morscher, R. J.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.573662\nNeuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumor derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells1,2. Like all cancers, its growth is fueled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis3,4. Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, with the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine showing clinical activity5. Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumor differentiation, and profound survival gains in the TH-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine/proline-free diet decreases the polyamine precursor ornithine and augments tumor polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at adenosine-ending codons. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by the diet-drug combination, favors a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programs have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of pediatric cancers.

M.; Khan, F. S.; Prabhu, V. V.; Lorenzi, P.; Burton, E.; Morey, R. R.; Lazcano, R.; Davies, M. A.; Patel, S. P.; Grimm, E. A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575058\nPurpose: Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive disease with very few treatment options. We previously demonstrated that mUM is characterized by high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we tested the anti-tumor, signaling and metabolic effects of imipridones, ClpP activators which reduce OXPHOS indirectly and have demonstrated safety in patients. Experimental Design: We assessed ClpP expression UM patient samples. We tested the effects of imipridones (ONC201, ONC212) on the growth, survival, signaling and metabolism of UM cell lines in vitro, and for therapeutic effects in vivo in UM liver metastasis models. Results: ClpP expression was confirmed in primary and mUM patient samples. ONC201/212 treatment of UM cell lines in vitro decreased OXPHOS effectors, inhibited cell growth and migration, and induced apoptosis. ONC212 increased metabolic stress and apoptotic pathways, inhibited amino acid metabolism, and induced cell death-related lipids. ONC212 also decreased tumor burden and increased survival in vivo in two UM liver metastasis models. Conclusion: Imipridones are a promising strategy for further testing and development in mUM.\nCancer cell type-specific derepression of transposable elements by inhibition of chromatin modifier enzymes\nAuthors: Patel, D.; Tiusanen, V.; Pihlajamaa, P.; Sahu, B.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575744\nThe combination of immunotherapy and epigenetic therapy is emerging as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Epigenetic therapy can induce derepression of transposable elements (TEs) that play a major role in activation of immune response against cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of TE regulation by distinct chromatin modifier enzymes (CME) and in the context of p53 is still elusive. Here, we used epigenetic drugs to inhibit distinct CMEs in p53 wild-type and p53-mutant colorectal and esophageal cancer cells. We show that distinct TEs subfamilies are derepressed by inhibition of different CMEs in a cell-type specific manner with loss of p53 resulting in stronger TE derepression. We show that KAP1, a known repressor of TEs, associates with stronger derepression of specific TE subfamilies such as LTR12C, indicating that KAP1 also has an activating role in TE regulation in cancer cells upon co-inhibition of DNMT and HDAC. Co-inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activates immune response by inducing inverted repeat Alu expression, reducing ADAR1-mediated Alu RNA editing, and inducing cell type-specific TE-chimeric transcript expression. Collectively, our study demonstrates that inhibition of different CMEs results in derepression of distinct TEs in cell type-specific manner and by utilizing distinct mechanistic pathways, providing insights for epigenetic therapies that could selectively enhance anti-tumor immunity in distinct cancer types.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Interactions between neurons and cancer cells are found in many malignancies, but their relevance for metastatic organ colonization remain largely unknown. It is also unclear whether any direct synaptic communication between neurons and cancer cells of non-neural tumor types exists, and if so, whether this can support metastasis and thus cancer progression. Here we show that excitatory synapses are formed between neurons and brain-metastatic melanoma and breast cancer cells. This starts at an early microscopic stage after extravasation into the brain parenchyma, during residence of cancer cells in the perivascular niche, a critical step for their survival. These neuron-cancer synapses showed a bona fide synaptic ultrastructure, and generated excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype in cancer cells. In accordance, AMPA receptor signatures were consistently detected in preclinical and patient samples of melanoma and breast cancer brain metastases. Genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of AMPA receptors with the approved antiepileptic drug perampanel in models of breast and melanoma cancer reduced the number of brain metastases and overall brain metastatic burden. These findings demonstrate for the first time that neurons can form biologically relevant direct synapses with non-neural cancer cells. In brain metastasis, a particularly challenging complication of many common malignancies, this non-canonical stimulatory synaptic interaction offers novel therapeutic opportunities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA substantial volume of RNA sequencing data were generated from cancer cell lines. However, it requires specific bioinformatics skills to compare gene expression levels across cell lines. This has hindered non-bioinformaticians from fully utilizing these valuable datasets in their research. To bridge this gap, we established a curated Pan-cancer Cell Line Transcriptome Atlas (PCTA) dataset. This resource aims to provide a user-friendly platform, allowing researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise to access and leverage the wealth of information within the dataset for their studies. Importantly, PCTA stands out by offering sufficient sample numbers per cell line in comparison to other pan-cancer datasets.

MethodsCell lines meta data and RNA sequencing data were retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), SRA and ARCHS4 databases. Utilizing the programming language R, we conducted data retrieval, normalization, and visualization. Only expression data for protein-coding genes and long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were considered in this study, streamlining the focus to enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis.

ResultsThe resulting PCTA dataset encompasses the expression matrix of 24,965 genes, featuring data from 84,385 samples derived from 5,677 studies. This comprehensive compilation spans 535 cell lines, representing a spectrum of 114 cancer types originating from 30 diverse tissue types. On UMAP plots, cell lines originating from the same type of tissue tend to cluster together, illustrating the datasets ability to capture biological relationships. To unravel molecular signatures, marker genes were identified for each cancer type. Additionally, an interactive and user-friendly web application (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/PCTA_app/) was developed for researchers to explore the PCTA dataset. This platform allows users to examine the expression pattern of their genes of interest across a diverse array of samples. Data are visualized as violin-, box-, and point-plots, enhancing the interpretability of the findings.

ConclusionThe PCTA stands as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into gene expression patterns across diverse cancer cell lines and providing a valuable tool to explore molecular signatures and potential therapeutic targets in cancer research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. Here we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38{beta}), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound 2{beta}1 integrin. Furthermore, 2{beta}1 integrin was necessary for macropinocytosis of soluble dextran, identifying it as a novel and targetable regulator of macropinocytosis in cancer. Moreover, disruption of 2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11 and PP2R1A-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Finally, 2{beta}1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly upregulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A and 2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the 2{beta}1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deciphering the structural variation across tumour genomes is crucial to determine the events driving tumour progression and better understand tumour adaptation and evolution. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an exemplar tumour type showing extreme, but poorly characterised structural diversity. We comprehensively describe the mutational landscape driving HGSOC, exploiting a large (N=324), deeply whole genome sequenced dataset. We reveal two divergent evolutionary trajectories, affecting patient survival and involving differing genomic environments. One involves homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) while the other is dominated by whole genome duplication (WGD) with frequent chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridges and extra-chromosomal DNA. These trajectories contribute to structural variation hotspots, containing novel candidate driver genes with significantly altered expression. While structural variation predominantly drives tumorigenesis, we also find high mtDNA mutation loads associated with shorter patient survival, and acting in combination with alterations in the nuclear genome to impact prognosis and suggesting new strategies for patient stratification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic cancer is becoming increasingly deadly, with treatment options limited due to, among others, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This short communications study investigates pulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) as a potential alternative to conventional radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer neoadjuvant treatment. Our ex vivo research demonstrates that PLDR, in combination with chemotherapy, promotes a shift from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing properties in a key component of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment we called CAFu (cancer-associated fibroblasts and self-generated extracellular matrix functional units). This beneficial effect translates to reduced desmoplasia (fibrous tumor expansion) and suggests PLDR&#39;s potential to improve total neoadjuvant therapy effectiveness. To comprehensively assess this functional shift, we developed the HOST-Factor, a single score integrating multiple biomarkers. This tool provides a more accurate picture of CAFu function compared to individual biomarkers and could be valuable for guiding and monitoring future therapeutic strategies. Our findings support the ongoing NCT04452357 clinical trial testing PLDR safety and TME normalization potential in pancreatic cancer patients. The HOST-Factor will be used in samples collected from this trial to validate its potential as a key tool for personalized medicine in this aggressive disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor cell intravasation is essential for metastatic dissemination, but its exact mechanism is incompletely understood. We have previously shown that in breast cancer, the direct and stable association of a tumor cell expressing Mena, a Tie2hi/Vegfhi macrophage, and a vascular endothelial cell, creates an intravasation portal, called a &#34;tumor microenvironment of metastasis&#34; (TMEM) doorway, for tumor cell intravasation, leading to dissemination to distant sites. The density of TMEM doorways, also called TMEM doorway score, is a clinically validated prognostic marker of distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. Although we know that tumor cells utilize TMEM doorway-associated transient vascular openings to intravasate, the precise signaling mechanisms involved in TMEM doorway function are only partially understood. Using two mouse models of breast cancer and an in vitro assay of intravasation, we report that CSF-1 secreted by the TMEM doorway tumor cell stimulates local secretion of VEGF-A from the Tie2hi TMEM doorway macrophage, leading to the dissociation of endothelial junctions between TMEM doorway associated endothelial cells, supporting tumor cell intravasation. Acute blockage of CSF-1R signaling decreases macrophage VEGF secretion as well as TMEM doorway-associated vascular opening, tumor cell trans-endothelial migration, and dissemination. These new insights into signaling events regulating TMEM doorway function should be explored further as treatment strategies for metastatic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rationale: Trastuzumab (TZM) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) and is clinically used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast tumors. However, the tumor microenvironment can limit the access of TZM to the HER2 targets across the whole tumor and thereby compromise TZMs therapeutic efficacy. An imaging methodology that can non-invasively quantify the binding of TZM-HER2, which is required for therapeutic action, and distribution within tumors with varying tumor microenvironments is much needed. Methods: We performed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence lifetime (FLI) Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to measure TZM-HER2 binding, using in vitro microscopy and in vivo widefield macroscopy, in HER2 overexpressing breast and ovarian cancer cells and tumor xenografts, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate in vivo imaging results. Results: NIR FLI FRET in vitro microscopy data show variations in intracellular distribution of bound TZM in HER2-positive breast AU565 and AU565 tumor-passaged XTM cell lines in comparison to SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. Macroscopy FLI (MFLI) FRET in vivo imaging data show that SKOV-3 tumors display reduced TZM binding compared to AU565 and XTM tumors, as validated by ex vivo immunohistochemistry. Moreover, AU565/XTM and SKOV-3 tumor xenografts display different amounts and distributions of TME components, such as collagen and vascularity. Therefore, these results suggest that SKOV-3 tumors are refractory to TZM delivery due to their disrupted vasculature and increased collagen content. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that FLI is a powerful analytical tool to monitor the delivery of antibody drug tumor both in cell cultures and in vivo live systems. Especially, MFLI FRET is a unique imaging modality that can directly quantify target engagement with potential to elucidate the role of the TME in drug delivery efficacy in intact live tumor xenografts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumor derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells1,2. Like all cancers, its growth is fueled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis3,4. Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, with the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine showing clinical activity5. Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumor differentiation, and profound survival gains in the TH-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine/proline-free diet decreases the polyamine precursor ornithine and augments tumor polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at adenosine-ending codons. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by the diet-drug combination, favors a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programs have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of pediatric cancers.

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive disease with very few treatment options. We previously demonstrated that mUM is characterized by high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we tested the anti-tumor, signaling and metabolic effects of imipridones, ClpP activators which reduce OXPHOS indirectly and have demonstrated safety in patients. Experimental Design: We assessed ClpP expression UM patient samples. We tested the effects of imipridones (ONC201, ONC212) on the growth, survival, signaling and metabolism of UM cell lines in vitro, and for therapeutic effects in vivo in UM liver metastasis models. Results: ClpP expression was confirmed in primary and mUM patient samples. ONC201/212 treatment of UM cell lines in vitro decreased OXPHOS effectors, inhibited cell growth and migration, and induced apoptosis. ONC212 increased metabolic stress and apoptotic pathways, inhibited amino acid metabolism, and induced cell death-related lipids. ONC212 also decreased tumor burden and increased survival in vivo in two UM liver metastasis models. Conclusion: Imipridones are a promising strategy for further testing and development in mUM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The combination of immunotherapy and epigenetic therapy is emerging as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Epigenetic therapy can induce derepression of transposable elements (TEs) that play a major role in activation of immune response against cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of TE regulation by distinct chromatin modifier enzymes (CME) and in the context of p53 is still elusive. Here, we used epigenetic drugs to inhibit distinct CMEs in p53 wild-type and p53-mutant colorectal and esophageal cancer cells. We show that distinct TEs subfamilies are derepressed by inhibition of different CMEs in a cell-type specific manner with loss of p53 resulting in stronger TE derepression. We show that KAP1, a known repressor of TEs, associates with stronger derepression of specific TE subfamilies such as LTR12C, indicating that KAP1 also has an activating role in TE regulation in cancer cells upon co-inhibition of DNMT and HDAC. Co-inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activates immune response by inducing inverted repeat Alu expression, reducing ADAR1-mediated Alu RNA editing, and inducing cell type-specific TE-chimeric transcript expression. Collectively, our study demonstrates that inhibition of different CMEs results in derepression of distinct TEs in cell type-specific manner and by utilizing distinct mechanistic pathways, providing insights for epigenetic therapies that could selectively enhance anti-tumor immunity in distinct cancer types.</p>
