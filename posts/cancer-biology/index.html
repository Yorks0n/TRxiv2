Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous, cell secreted nano-vehicles which have been explored for functional siRNA delivery, yet impurities in EVs preparation and lack of efficient siRNA loading method have been limiting its further development into clinical applications. In this work, we have achieved high quality EVs production and an siRNA loading system via EVs. The prepared EV-siRNA system was able to deliver siRNA cargo to model cell lines to silence the expression of targeted genes with high potency. Furthermore, EV-siRNA administration in a tumor xenograft model significantly inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, this study establishes an innovative and efficient EV-siRNA platform for siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo.\nGlioblastoma is spatially organized by neurodevelopmental programs and a glial-like wound healing response\nAuthors: Mossi Albiach, A.; Janusauskas, J.; Kapustova, I.; Kvedaraite, E.; Codeluppi, S.; Munting, J.

J.; Thiessen, R.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556421\nMalignant gliomas are notoriously invasive, a major impediment against their successful treatment. This invasive growth has motivated the use of predictive partial differential equation models, formulated at varying levels of detail, and including (i) \"proliferation-infiltration\" models, (ii) \"go-or-grow\" models, and (iii) anisotropic diffusion models. Often, these models use macroscopic observations of a diffuse tumour interface to motivate a phenomenological description of invasion, rather than performing a detailed and mechanistic modelling of glioma cell invasion processes. Here we close this gap. Based on experiments that support an important role played by long cellular protrusions, termed tumour microtubes, we formulate a new model for microtube-driven glioma invasion. In particular, we model a population of tumour cells that extend tissue-infiltrating microtubes. Mitosis leads to new nuclei that migrate along the microtubes and settle elsewhere. A combination of steady state analysis and numerical simulation is employed to show that the model can predict an expanding tumour, with travelling wave solutions led by microtube dynamics. A sequence of scaling arguments allows us reduce the detailed model into simpler formulations, including models falling into each of the general classes (i), (ii), and (iii) above. This analysis allows us to clearly identify the assumptions under which these various models can be a posteriori justified in the context of microtube-driven glioma invasion. Numerical simulations are used to compare the various model classes and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages.\nTPX2 expression promotes sensitivity to dasatinib in breast cancer by activating the YAP transcriptional signaling.\nAuthors: Marugan, C.; Ortigosa, B.; Sanz-Gomez, N.; Monfort-Vengut, A.; Bertinetti, C.; Teijo, A.; Gonzalez, M.; Alonso de la Vega, A.; Lallena, M. J.; Moreno-Bueno, G.; de Carcer, G.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556165\nChromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, providing genetic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity that allows the tumor to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. CIN is considered a cancer therapeutic biomarker because healthy cells do not exhibit CIN. Despite recent efforts to identify therapeutic strategies related to CIN, the results obtained have been very limited. CIN is characterized by a genetic signature where a collection of genes, mostly mitotic regulators, are overexpressed in CIN-positive tumors, providing aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We attempted to identify new therapeutic strategies related to CIN genes by performing a drug screen, using cells that individually express CIN-associated genes in an inducible manner. We find that the overexpression of TPX2 enhances sensitivity to the SRC inhibitor dasatinib due to activation of the YAP pathway. Furthermore, using breast cancer data from the TCGA and a cohort of cancer-derived patient samples, we find that both TPX2 expression and YAP activation are present in a significant percentage of cancer tumor samples, providing poor prognosis, being therefore putative biomarkers for dasatinib therapy.\nLow albumin status accompanies multi-layered immunosuppressive phenotypes in metastatic breast cancer patients\nAuthors: Nakamura, Y.; Yoda, M.; Izumi, Y.; Kashima, Y.; Takahashi, M.; Nakatani, K.; Bamba, T.; He, C.; Konishi, R.; Saldajeno, D. P.; Vandenbon, A.; Suzuki, Y.; Toi, M.; Kawaguchi, K.; Kawaoka, S.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556440\nLow albumin status is prevalent in advanced cancer patients, but the pathophysiology associated with this anomaly remains largely unexplored. To address this, we aim to search correlations of albumin levels with the transcriptome against peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma metabolome within the same patients having metastatic breast cancers. We confirm that metastatic breast cancer patients exhibit low albumin levels in varying degrees without prominent systemic inflammation. Our data demonstrate that low albumin levels correlate with transcriptome signatures indicative of neutrophil activation and T-cell down-regulation, an immunosuppressive phenotype. We also find that immunoregulatory metabolites, such as arginine, are reduced in plasma in an albumin-correlated manner, further corroborating systemic immunosuppression. These results are verified using a mouse model of breast cancer. We conclude that low albumin status in metastatic breast cancer patients accompanies immunosuppressive phenotypes, which is likely unfavorable for anti-cancer immunotherapy and thus can be a cause of unsuccessful treatment outcomes.\nThe SLC1A1/EAAT3 Dicarboxylic Amino Acid Transporter is an Epigenetically Dysregulated Nutrient Carrier that Sustains Oncogenic Metabolic Programs\nAuthors: Grubb, T. M.; Khatun, J.; Matar, S.; Ghandour, F.; Dubasik, N.; Salem, C.; Orlando, D. A.; Guenther, M. G.; Martinez, S. R.; Koochaki, P.; Coker, J. A.; Tang, C.; Reznik, E.; Kotecha, R. R.; Hakimi, A. A.; Abdallah, N.; Weight, C. J.; Choueiri, T. K.; Asara, J. M.; Stauffer, S. R.; Signoretti, S.; Kaelin, W. G.; Chakraborty, A. A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556240\nInactivation of pVHL tumor suppressor in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) increases the abundance of Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). We hypothesized that H3K27ac, a marker of transcriptional activation, drives the expression of critical oncogenes in ccRCC. Using H3K27ac ChIP-Seq; RNA-Seq; an in vivo positive selection screen; cell-based functional studies; and clinical validations; here, we report the identification of the SLC1A1/EAAT3 aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) transporter as a ccRCC oncogene. pVHL loss promotes SLC1A1 expression in a HIF-independent manner. Importantly, SLC1A1 inactivation depletes Asp/Glu-derived metabolites, impedes ccRCC growth both in vitro and in vivo, and sensitizes ccRCCs to metabolic therapeutics (e.g., glutaminase blockers). Finally, in human ccRCC biospecimens, higher SLC1A1 expression is associated with metastatic disease and clusters with elevated expression of other solute carriers, but not HIF/Hypoxia pathways. Altogether, our studies identify a HIF-independent metabolic hub in ccRCC and credential SLC1A1 as an actionable ccRCC oncogene. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCETargeting chronic HIF activation underlies many therapeutic strategies in ccRCC; but, unfortunately, is not curative. SLC1A1, instead, represents a HIF-independent ccRCC dependency, which is targetable alone and together with other antimetabolites, such as glutaminase inhibitors. These observations identify an actionable metabolic program that functions independent of HIF in ccRCC.\nCellular taxonomy of the preleukemic bone marrow niche of acute myeloid leukemia\nAuthors: Goda, C.; Kulkarni, R.; Rudich, A.; Karunasiri, M.; Balcioglu, O.; Al-Marrawi, Y.; Korn, E.; Kanna, S.; Garfinkle, E. A. R.; Mundy-Bosse, B.; Zhang, B.; Marcucci, G.; Mardis, E. R.; Garzon, R.; Miller, K. E.; Dorrance, A. M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.553259\nMutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) can remain dormant within the bone marrow (BM) for decades before leukemia onset. Understanding the mechanisms by which these mutant clones eventually slead to full blown leukemia is of critical importance to develop strategies to eliminate these clones before they achieve their full leukemogenic potential. Recent data suggest that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) induce alterations within BM microenvironment (BMM) favoring LSC growth over normal HSCs. However, the cross talk between preleukemic stem cells (pLSC) and BMM is not completely understood. We hypothesize that pLSC induces critical changes within the BMM that are critical for leukemogenesis. To address this question, we are using our previously developed murine model of AML that highly recapitulates the human disease, develops AML sporadically with a preleukemic phase in which mice display normal white blood counts (WBCs) and absence of blasts in the BM. Thus, this is an excellent model to evaluate changes in the BMM that occurs during progression into AML. Using this model we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on cells from the BMM compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Overall, we defined the transcriptional profiles of pre-leukemic BMM cells and observed decreased percentages of normal BMM cells such as LepR+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), known to regulate normal HSC function. Concomitantly, we found increases in CD55+ fibroblasts and NG2+ pericytes, that might play a more important role in regulation of pre-LSCs. Preleukemic CD55+ fibroblasts had a higher proliferation rate and showed significant down-regulation of several collagen genes known for regulating extra cellular matrix (ECM) including: Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col4a1, and Col6a1, suggesting that ECM remodeling occurs in the early stages of leukemogenesis. Importantly, co-culture assays found that pre-leukemic CD55+ BM fibroblasts expanded pre-LSCs significantly over normal HSCs. In conclusion, we have identified distinct changes in the preleukemic BMM and identified a novel CD55+ fibroblast population that is expanded in preleukemic BMM that promote the fitness of pre-LSCs over normal HSCs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe have identified changes in the BMM landscape that define a preleukemic BM niche which includes the expansion of a novel CD55+ fibroblast population. These data suggest that a distinct preleukemic BM niche exists and preferentially supports LSC survival and expansion over normal HSCs to promote leukemogenesis.\nSmall Extracellular Vesicles from Failing Heart Accelerate Tumor Growth\nAuthors: Caller, T.; Rotem, I.; Shaihov Teper, O.; Lendengolts, D.; Schary, Y.; Shai, R.; Glick Saar, E.; Dominissini, D.; Motie, M.; Katzir, I.; Popovtzer, R.; Nahmoud, M.; Boomgarden, A.; DSouza Schorey, C.; Naftali Shani, N.; Leor, J.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.555686\nBackgroundMyocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) are associated with an increased incidence of cancer. The mechanism is complex and unclear. Here, we aimed to test our hypothesis that cardiac small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), particularly cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells-derived sEVs (cMSC-sEVs), contribute to the link between post-MI HF and cancer. MethodsWe purified and characterized sEVs from the whole heart and cultured cMSCs. Then, we analyzed cMSC-EV cargo and pro-neoplastic effects on several types of cancer cell lines, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Next, we modeled post-MI HF along with heterotopic and orthotopic lung and breast cancer tumors in mice. We used cMSC-sEV transfer to assess sEV biodistribution and its effect on tumor growth. Finally, we tested the effects of sEV depletion and spironolactone treatment on cMSC-EV release and tumor growth. ResultsPost-MI hearts, particularly cMSCs, produced more sEVs with pro-neoplastic cargo than non-failing hearts did. Proteomic analysis revealed unique protein profiles and higher quantities of tumor-promoting cytokines, proteins, and microRNAs in cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts. The pro-neoplastic effects of cMSC-sEVs varied with different types of cancer cells, substantially affecting lung cancer cells relative to other more aggressive cancer cell lines. We also found that post-MI cMSC-sEVs activated resting macrophages into pro-angiogenic and pro-tumorigenic states in vitro. At 28-day follow-up analysis, mice with post-MI HF developed larger lung tumors than did sham-MI mice. Adoptive transfer of cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts accelerated lung tumor growth, and biodistribution analysis revealed an accumulating cMSC- sEVs in tumor cells along with accelerated tumor cell proliferation. Significantly, sEV depletion reduced the tumor-promoting effects of HF, and adoptive transfer of cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts partially restored it. Finally, post-MI spironolactone treatment reduced the number of cMSC-sEVs and suppressed tumor growth during post-MI HF. ConclusionsFor the first time, we show that cardiac sEVs, specifically cMSC-sEVs from post-MI failing hearts, carry multiple pro-tumorigenic factors. Uptake of cMSC-sEVs by cancer cells accelerates tumor growth. Post-MI spironolactone treatment reduces the associated tumor growth. Thus, we provide new insight into the link between post-MI HF and cancer and propose a translational option to mitigate this deadly association.\nRole of Lactate in the Regulation of Transcriptional Activity of Breast Cancer-Related Genes and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Proteins: A Comparison of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell Lines\nAuthors: San-Millan, I.; Martinez, J. L.; Pickard, S. L.; Yu, H.; Hirsch, F. R.; Rivard, C. J.; Brooks, G. A.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.23.533060\nThe Warburg Effect is characterized by accelerated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production and under fully aerobic conditions is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of endogenous, glucose-derived lactate as an oncometabolite which regulates gene expression in the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 cell line cultivated in glucose media. Presently, with the addition of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, we further confirm the effect of lactate on gene expression patterns and extend results to include lactate effects on protein expression. As well, we report effects of lactate on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endogenous lactate regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. In MCF7 cells, lactate increased the expression of EGFR, VEGF, HIF-1a, KRAS, MIF, mTOR, PIK3CA, TP53, and CDK4 as well as decreased the expression of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, E2F1, MET, MYC, and RAF mainly after 48h of exposure. On the other hand, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, lactate increased the expressions of PIK3CA, VEGF, EGFR, mTOR, HIF-1, ATM, E2F1, TP53 and decreased the expressions of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, MET, MIF, MYC, and RAF after 48h of exposure. In response to endogenous lactate, changes in protein ex-pression of representative genes corroborated changes in mRNA expressions. Finally, lactate exposure decreased E-cadherin protein expression in MCF7 cells and increased vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, by genetically silencing LDHA in MCF7 cells, we show suppression of protein expression of EGFR and HIF-1, while full protein expression occurred under glucose and glucose + exogenous lactate exposure. Hence, endogenous, glucose-derived lactate, and not glucose, elicited changes in gene and protein expression levels. In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous lactate produced under aerobic conditions (Warburg Effect) elicits important changes in gene and protein expression in both ER+ and TNBC cell lines. The widespread regulation of multiple genes by lactate and involves those involved in carcinogenesis including DNA repair, cell growth, prolif-eration, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, lactate affected the expression of two relevant EMT biomarkers, E-cadherin and vimentin, which could contribute to the complex process of EMT and a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype in the two cancer cell lines studied.\nConvergent alterations in the tumor microenvironment of MYC-driven human and murine prostate cancer\nAuthors: Graham, M. K.; Wang, R.; Chikarmane, R.; Wodu, B.; Vaghasia, A.; Gupta, A.; Zheng, Q.; Hicks, J.; Sysa-Shah, P.; Pan, X.; Castagna, N.; Liu, J.; Meyers, J.; Skaist, A.; Zhang, Y.; Schuebel, K.; Simons, B.; Bieberich, C. J.; Nelson, W.; Lupold, S. E.; DeWeese, T. L.; De Marzo, A. M.; Yegnasubramanian, S.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.553268\nThe tissue microenvironment in prostate cancer is profoundly altered. While such alterations have been implicated in driving prostate cancer initiation and progression to aggressive disease, how prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate those changes is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we performed extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and rigorous molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key time points in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues, with validation in a large external data set, revealed that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling was the top up-regulated pathway in human cancers, representing a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Likewise, numerous non-malignant cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including non-cancerous epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell compartments, were conserved across individuals, raising the possibility that these cell types may be a sequelae of the convergent MYC activation in the cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GEMM of prostate epithelial cell-specific MYC activation in two mouse strains. Cell communication network and pathway analyses suggested that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogrammed the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to the emergence of cascading cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that paralleled key findings in human prostate cancer. Importantly, among these changes, the progression from a precursor-enriched to invasive-cancer-enriched state was accompanied by a cell-intrinsic switch from pro-immunogenic to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs with coinciding enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid and Treg cells in the immune microenvironment. These findings implicate activation of MYC signaling in reshaping convergent aspects of the TME of prostate cancer as a common denominator across the otherwise well-documented molecular heterogeneity of human prostate cancer.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To fulfill the potential of small interference RNA (siRNA) therapeutics, diverse and efficient delivery platforms for siRNA are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous, cell secreted nano-vehicles which have been explored for functional siRNA delivery, yet impurities in EVs preparation and lack of efficient siRNA loading method have been limiting its further development into clinical applications. In this work, we have achieved high quality EVs production and an siRNA loading system via EVs. The prepared EV-siRNA system was able to deliver siRNA cargo to model cell lines to silence the expression of targeted genes with high potency. Furthermore, EV-siRNA administration in a tumor xenograft model significantly inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, this study establishes an innovative and efficient EV-siRNA platform for siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malignant gliomas are notoriously invasive, a major impediment against their successful treatment. This invasive growth has motivated the use of predictive partial differential equation models, formulated at varying levels of detail, and including (i) &#34;proliferation-infiltration&#34; models, (ii) &#34;go-or-grow&#34; models, and (iii) anisotropic diffusion models. Often, these models use macroscopic observations of a diffuse tumour interface to motivate a phenomenological description of invasion, rather than performing a detailed and mechanistic modelling of glioma cell invasion processes. Here we close this gap. Based on experiments that support an important role played by long cellular protrusions, termed tumour microtubes, we formulate a new model for microtube-driven glioma invasion. In particular, we model a population of tumour cells that extend tissue-infiltrating microtubes. Mitosis leads to new nuclei that migrate along the microtubes and settle elsewhere. A combination of steady state analysis and numerical simulation is employed to show that the model can predict an expanding tumour, with travelling wave solutions led by microtube dynamics. A sequence of scaling arguments allows us reduce the detailed model into simpler formulations, including models falling into each of the general classes (i), (ii), and (iii) above. This analysis allows us to clearly identify the assumptions under which these various models can be a posteriori justified in the context of microtube-driven glioma invasion. Numerical simulations are used to compare the various model classes and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, providing genetic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity that allows the tumor to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. CIN is considered a cancer therapeutic biomarker because healthy cells do not exhibit CIN. Despite recent efforts to identify therapeutic strategies related to CIN, the results obtained have been very limited. CIN is characterized by a genetic signature where a collection of genes, mostly mitotic regulators, are overexpressed in CIN-positive tumors, providing aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We attempted to identify new therapeutic strategies related to CIN genes by performing a drug screen, using cells that individually express CIN-associated genes in an inducible manner. We find that the overexpression of TPX2 enhances sensitivity to the SRC inhibitor dasatinib due to activation of the YAP pathway. Furthermore, using breast cancer data from the TCGA and a cohort of cancer-derived patient samples, we find that both TPX2 expression and YAP activation are present in a significant percentage of cancer tumor samples, providing poor prognosis, being therefore putative biomarkers for dasatinib therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low albumin status is prevalent in advanced cancer patients, but the pathophysiology associated with this anomaly remains largely unexplored. To address this, we aim to search correlations of albumin levels with the transcriptome against peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma metabolome within the same patients having metastatic breast cancers. We confirm that metastatic breast cancer patients exhibit low albumin levels in varying degrees without prominent systemic inflammation. Our data demonstrate that low albumin levels correlate with transcriptome signatures indicative of neutrophil activation and T-cell down-regulation, an immunosuppressive phenotype. We also find that immunoregulatory metabolites, such as arginine, are reduced in plasma in an albumin-correlated manner, further corroborating systemic immunosuppression. These results are verified using a mouse model of breast cancer. We conclude that low albumin status in metastatic breast cancer patients accompanies immunosuppressive phenotypes, which is likely unfavorable for anti-cancer immunotherapy and thus can be a cause of unsuccessful treatment outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inactivation of pVHL tumor suppressor in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) increases the abundance of Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). We hypothesized that H3K27ac, a marker of transcriptional activation, drives the expression of critical oncogenes in ccRCC. Using H3K27ac ChIP-Seq; RNA-Seq; an in vivo positive selection screen; cell-based functional studies; and clinical validations; here, we report the identification of the SLC1A1/EAAT3 aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) transporter as a ccRCC oncogene. pVHL loss promotes SLC1A1 expression in a HIF-independent manner. Importantly, SLC1A1 inactivation depletes Asp/Glu-derived metabolites, impedes ccRCC growth both in vitro and in vivo, and sensitizes ccRCCs to metabolic therapeutics (e.g., glutaminase blockers). Finally, in human ccRCC biospecimens, higher SLC1A1 expression is associated with metastatic disease and clusters with elevated expression of other solute carriers, but not HIF/Hypoxia pathways. Altogether, our studies identify a HIF-independent metabolic hub in ccRCC and credential SLC1A1 as an actionable ccRCC oncogene.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCETargeting chronic HIF activation underlies many therapeutic strategies in ccRCC; but, unfortunately, is not curative. SLC1A1, instead, represents a HIF-independent ccRCC dependency, which is targetable alone and together with other antimetabolites, such as glutaminase inhibitors. These observations identify an actionable metabolic program that functions independent of HIF in ccRCC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) can remain dormant within the bone marrow (BM) for decades before leukemia onset. Understanding the mechanisms by which these mutant clones eventually slead to full blown leukemia is of critical importance to develop strategies to eliminate these clones before they achieve their full leukemogenic potential. Recent data suggest that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) induce alterations within BM microenvironment (BMM) favoring LSC growth over normal HSCs. However, the cross talk between preleukemic stem cells (pLSC) and BMM is not completely understood. We hypothesize that pLSC induces critical changes within the BMM that are critical for leukemogenesis. To address this question, we are using our previously developed murine model of AML that highly recapitulates the human disease, develops AML sporadically with a preleukemic phase in which mice display normal white blood counts (WBCs) and absence of blasts in the BM. Thus, this is an excellent model to evaluate changes in the BMM that occurs during progression into AML. Using this model we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on cells from the BMM compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Overall, we defined the transcriptional profiles of pre-leukemic BMM cells and observed decreased percentages of normal BMM cells such as LepR&#43; mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), known to regulate normal HSC function. Concomitantly, we found increases in CD55&#43; fibroblasts and NG2&#43; pericytes, that might play a more important role in regulation of pre-LSCs. Preleukemic CD55&#43; fibroblasts had a higher proliferation rate and showed significant down-regulation of several collagen genes known for regulating extra cellular matrix (ECM) including: Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col4a1, and Col6a1, suggesting that ECM remodeling occurs in the early stages of leukemogenesis. Importantly, co-culture assays found that pre-leukemic CD55&#43; BM fibroblasts expanded pre-LSCs significantly over normal HSCs. In conclusion, we have identified distinct changes in the preleukemic BMM and identified a novel CD55&#43; fibroblast population that is expanded in preleukemic BMM that promote the fitness of pre-LSCs over normal HSCs.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe have identified changes in the BMM landscape that define a preleukemic BM niche which includes the expansion of a novel CD55&#43; fibroblast population. These data suggest that a distinct preleukemic BM niche exists and preferentially supports LSC survival and expansion over normal HSCs to promote leukemogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMyocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) are associated with an increased incidence of cancer. The mechanism is complex and unclear. Here, we aimed to test our hypothesis that cardiac small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), particularly cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells-derived sEVs (cMSC-sEVs), contribute to the link between post-MI HF and cancer.

MethodsWe purified and characterized sEVs from the whole heart and cultured cMSCs. Then, we analyzed cMSC-EV cargo and pro-neoplastic effects on several types of cancer cell lines, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Next, we modeled post-MI HF along with heterotopic and orthotopic lung and breast cancer tumors in mice. We used cMSC-sEV transfer to assess sEV biodistribution and its effect on tumor growth. Finally, we tested the effects of sEV depletion and spironolactone treatment on cMSC-EV release and tumor growth.

ResultsPost-MI hearts, particularly cMSCs, produced more sEVs with pro-neoplastic cargo than non-failing hearts did. Proteomic analysis revealed unique protein profiles and higher quantities of tumor-promoting cytokines, proteins, and microRNAs in cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts. The pro-neoplastic effects of cMSC-sEVs varied with different types of cancer cells, substantially affecting lung cancer cells relative to other more aggressive cancer cell lines. We also found that post-MI cMSC-sEVs activated resting macrophages into pro-angiogenic and pro-tumorigenic states in vitro. At 28-day follow-up analysis, mice with post-MI HF developed larger lung tumors than did sham-MI mice. Adoptive transfer of cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts accelerated lung tumor growth, and biodistribution analysis revealed an accumulating cMSC- sEVs in tumor cells along with accelerated tumor cell proliferation. Significantly, sEV depletion reduced the tumor-promoting effects of HF, and adoptive transfer of cMSC-sEVs from failing hearts partially restored it. Finally, post-MI spironolactone treatment reduced the number of cMSC-sEVs and suppressed tumor growth during post-MI HF.

ConclusionsFor the first time, we show that cardiac sEVs, specifically cMSC-sEVs from post-MI failing hearts, carry multiple pro-tumorigenic factors. Uptake of cMSC-sEVs by cancer cells accelerates tumor growth. Post-MI spironolactone treatment reduces the associated tumor growth. Thus, we provide new insight into the link between post-MI HF and cancer and propose a translational option to mitigate this deadly association.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Warburg Effect is characterized by accelerated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production and under fully aerobic conditions is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of endogenous, glucose-derived lactate as an oncometabolite which regulates gene expression in the estrogen receptor positive (ER&#43;) MCF7 cell line cultivated in glucose media. Presently, with the addition of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, we further confirm the effect of lactate on gene expression patterns and extend results to include lactate effects on protein expression. As well, we report effects of lactate on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endogenous lactate regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. In MCF7 cells, lactate increased the expression of EGFR, VEGF, HIF-1a, KRAS, MIF, mTOR, PIK3CA, TP53, and CDK4 as well as decreased the expression of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, E2F1, MET, MYC, and RAF mainly after 48h of exposure. On the other hand, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, lactate increased the expressions of PIK3CA, VEGF, EGFR, mTOR, HIF-1, ATM, E2F1, TP53 and decreased the expressions of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, MET, MIF, MYC, and RAF after 48h of exposure. In response to endogenous lactate, changes in protein ex-pression of representative genes corroborated changes in mRNA expressions. Finally, lactate exposure decreased E-cadherin protein expression in MCF7 cells and increased vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, by genetically silencing LDHA in MCF7 cells, we show suppression of protein expression of EGFR and HIF-1, while full protein expression occurred under glucose and glucose &#43; exogenous lactate exposure. Hence, endogenous, glucose-derived lactate, and not glucose, elicited changes in gene and protein expression levels. In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous lactate produced under aerobic conditions (Warburg Effect) elicits important changes in gene and protein expression in both ER&#43; and TNBC cell lines. The widespread regulation of multiple genes by lactate and involves those involved in carcinogenesis including DNA repair, cell growth, prolif-eration, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, lactate affected the expression of two relevant EMT biomarkers, E-cadherin and vimentin, which could contribute to the complex process of EMT and a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype in the two cancer cell lines studied.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tissue microenvironment in prostate cancer is profoundly altered. While such alterations have been implicated in driving prostate cancer initiation and progression to aggressive disease, how prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate those changes is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we performed extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and rigorous molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key time points in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues, with validation in a large external data set, revealed that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling was the top up-regulated pathway in human cancers, representing a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Likewise, numerous non-malignant cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including non-cancerous epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell compartments, were conserved across individuals, raising the possibility that these cell types may be a sequelae of the convergent MYC activation in the cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GEMM of prostate epithelial cell-specific MYC activation in two mouse strains. Cell communication network and pathway analyses suggested that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogrammed the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to the emergence of cascading cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that paralleled key findings in human prostate cancer. Importantly, among these changes, the progression from a precursor-enriched to invasive-cancer-enriched state was accompanied by a cell-intrinsic switch from pro-immunogenic to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs with coinciding enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid and Treg cells in the immune microenvironment. These findings implicate activation of MYC signaling in reshaping convergent aspects of the TME of prostate cancer as a common denominator across the otherwise well-documented molecular heterogeneity of human prostate cancer.</p>
