Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNA can drive exceptionally high dosage of MYC and afford cancer cells rapid adaptation to microenvironmental changes. The continued maintenance of extrachromosomal MYC is uniquely ensured by the presence of the selective pressure. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors, with the highest MYC levels correlating with squamous-like phenotypes. Our work provides the first detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC.\nTumor sialylation is a barrier against CD8 T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses and anti-PD-1 resistance in breast cancer\nAuthors: Mereiter, S.; Jonsson, G.; Oliveira, T.; Helm, J.; Hoffmann, D.; Abeln, M.; Jochum, A.-K.; Jochum, W.; Kellner, M. J.; Feith, M.; Tkalec, V.; Wasilewska, K.; Jiao, J.; Emsenhuber, L.; Holstein, F.; Obenauf, A.; Lordello, L.; Scoazec, J.-Y.; Kroemer, G.; Zitvogel, L.; Ali, O. H.; Flatz, L.; Gerardy-Schahn, R.; Muenster-Kuehnel, A.; Stadlmann, J.; Penninger, J. M.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558571\nImmunotherapies have revolutionized treatment and management of cancers. However, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in breast cancer is limited due to lack of efficacy. Sialylation, the modification of glycans with sialic acid, is frequently upregulated in various cancer types and has potent immunoregulatory properties. However, its specific role in breast cancer immune evasion has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer sialylation drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, thus hampering the efficient eradication of tumors by CD8+ T cells. Notably, abrogation of tumor sialylation, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only facilitated CD8-mediated tumor control but also enabled the recruitment of Tcf7+ memory T cells. Significantly, abrogation of sialylation sensitized PD-1-resistant breast tumors to immunotherapy. Sialylation interference was well-tolerated in mammary development and function. We further demonstrate that hyper-sialylation occurs in over half of human breast cancers and correlates with poor T cell infiltration. Our results establish sialylation as a central immunoregulator in breast cancer, orchestrating multiple pathways that ultimately culminate in immune evasion. Importantly, our study underscores the potential of targeting this pathway to enhance tumor control, converting immunologically inert tumors into inflamed ones, and prime tumors for synergistic interventions involving immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nNanoparticle delivery of innate immune agonists combines with senescence-inducing agents to mediate T cell control of pancreatic cancer\nAuthors: Chibaya, L.; Lusi, C.

U.; Ruscetti, M. A.\nScore: 12.7, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558307\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has quickly risen to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death. This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining local delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-dependent tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC. SUMMARYCombining senescence-inducing MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists leads to interferon-driven and cytotoxic T cell-mediated PDAC control.\nThe target gene regulatory network of miR-497 in angiosarcoma\nAuthors: Benton, A.; Terwilliger, E.; Moriarty, N. M.; Liu, B.; Murphy, A.; Maluvac, H.; Shu, M.; Gartenhaus, L. E.; Janson, N. D.; Pfeffer, C. M.; Utturkar, S. M.; Parkinson, E. I.; Lanman, N. A.; Hanna, J. A.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559218\nAngiosarcoma (AS) is a vascular sarcoma that is highly aggressive and metastatic. Due to its rarity, treatment options for patients are limited, therefore more research is needed to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities. We previously found that conditional deletion of Dicer1 drives AS development in mice. Given the role of DICER1 in canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, this suggests that miRNA loss is important in AS development. After testing miRNAs previously suggested to have a tumor-suppressive role in AS, microRNA-497-5p (miR-497) suppressed cell viability most significantly. We also found that miR-497 overexpression led to significantly reduced cell migration and tumor formation. To understand the mechanism of miR-497 in tumor suppression, we identified clinically relevant target genes using a combination of RNA-sequencing data in an AS cell line, expression data from AS patients, and target prediction algorithms. We validated miR-497 direct regulation of CCND2, CDK6, and VAT1. One of these genes, VAT1, is an understudied protein that has been suggested to promote cell migration and metastasis in other cancers. Indeed, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of VAT1 with the natural product Neocarzilin A reduces AS migration. This work provides insight into the mechanisms of miR-497 and its target genes in AS pathogenesis.\nClonal fitness decline in somatic differentiation hierarchies\nAuthors: Ahmed, I.; Dingli, D.; Huang, W.; Werner, B.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559763\nThe concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.\nIdentification of astrocyte-driven pseudolineages reveals clinical stratification and therapeutic targets in Glioblastoma\nAuthors: Foerster, L. C.; Kaya, O.; Wust, V.; Bekavac, M.; Ziegler, K. C.; Akcay, V.; Stinchcombe, N.; Gesteira Perez, N.; Ma, X.; Sadik, A.; Le, P. U.; Petrecca, K.; Opitz, C.; Liu, H.; Wirtz, C. R.; Anders, S.; Goncalves, A.; Martin-Villalba, A.\nScore: 32.8, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557713\nCancer research has predominantly targeted genetic mutations, while only recently has attention shifted to understanding tumor cell-stages. However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.\nEvolutionary fingerprints of EMT in pancreatic cancers\nAuthors: Perelli, L.; Zhang, L.; Mangiameli, S.; Russell, A. J. C.; Giannese, F.; Peng, F.; Carbone, F.; Le, C.; Khan, H.; Citron, F.; Soeung, M.; Lam, T.; Lundgren, S.; Zhu, C.; Catania, D.; Feng, N.; Gurreri, E.; Sgambato, A.; Tortora, G.; Draetta, G.; Tonon, G.; Futreal, A.; Giuliani, V.; Carugo, A.; Viale, A.; Heffernan, T.; Wang, L.; Cittaro, D.; Chen, F.; Genovese, G.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558231\nMesenchymal plasticity has been extensively described in advanced and metastatic epithelial cancers; however, its functional role in malignant progression, metastatic dissemination and therapy response is controversial. More importantly, the role of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumor heterogeneity, clonal selection and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Functionally, our work clarifies the contribution of EMT to malignant progression and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. We leveraged ad hoc somatic mosaic genome engineering, lineage tracing and ablation technologies and dynamic genetic reporters to trace and ablate tumor-specific lineages along the phenotypic spectrum of epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity. The experimental evidences clarify the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution and metastatic dissemination. Spatial genomic analysis combined with single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of epithelial and mesenchymal lineages reveals that EMT promotes with the emergence of chromosomal instability (CIN). Specifically tumor lineages with mesenchymal features display highly conserved patterns of genomic evolution including complex structural genomic rearrangements and chromotriptic events. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross species analysis of pancreatic and other human epithelial cancers. Mechanistically, we discovered that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, which in turn results in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Therefore, EMT favors the emergence of high-fitness tumor cells, strongly supporting the concept of a cell-state, lineage-restricted patterns of evolution, where cancer cell sub-clonal speciation is propagated to progenies only through restricted functional compartments. Restraining those evolutionary routes through genetic ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity and extinction of the derived lineages completely abrogates the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive form of human cancer.\nKRAS inhibition activates an actionable CD24 do-not-eat-me signal in pancreas cancer\nAuthors: Wei, Y.; Liu, M.; Yen, E.-Y.; Yao, J.; Nguyen, P. T.; Wang, X.; Yang, Z.; Yousef, A.; Pan, D.; Jin, Y.; Theady, M. S.; Park, J.; Cai, Y.; Takeda, M.; Vasquez, M.; Zhou, Y.; Zhao, H.; Viale, A.; Wang, H.; Zhao, D.; DePinho, R. A.; Yao, W.; Ying, H.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558891\nKRASG12C inhibitor (G12Ci) has produced encouraging, albeit modest and transient, clinical benefit in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Identifying and targeting resistance mechanisms to G12Ci treatment is therefore crucial. To better understand the tumor biology of the KRASG12C allele and possible bypass mechanisms, we developed a novel autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model. Compared to the classical KRASG12D PDAC model, the G12C model exhibit slower tumor growth, yet similar histopathological and molecular features. Aligned with clinical experience, G12Ci treatment of KRASG12C tumors produced modest impact despite stimulating a hot tumor immune microenvironment. Immunoprofiling revealed that CD24, a do-not-eat-me signal, is significantly upregulated on cancer cells upon G12Ci treatment. Blocking CD24 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and significantly sensitized tumors to G12Ci treatment. Similar findings were observed in KRASG12D-driven PDAC. Our study reveals common and distinct oncogenic KRAS allele-specific biology and identifies a clinically actionable adaptive mechanism that may improve the efficacy of oncogenic KRAS inhibitor therapy in PDAC. SignificanceLack of faithful preclinical models limits the exploration of resistance mechanisms to KRASG12C inhibitor in PDAC. We generated an autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model, which revealed allele-specific biology of the KRASG12C during PDAC development. We identified CD24 as an actionable adaptive mechanisms in cancer cells induced upon KRASG12C inhibition and blocking CD24 sensitizes PDAC to KRAS inhibitors in preclinical models.\nThe expression of PKM1 and PKM2 in developing, benign, and cancerous prostatic tissues\nAuthors: Li, L.; Cheng, S.; Yeh, Y.; Shi, Y.; Henderson, N.; Price, D.; Gu, X.; Yu, X.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559832\nNeuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) is the most aggressive type of prostate cancer. However, energy metabolism, one of the cancer hallmarks, in NEPC had not been well studied yet. Pyruvate kinase M (PKM), which catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, has two main splicing isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2. PKM2 is known to be upregulated in various cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPCa). In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and bioinformatic analysis to study the expression of PKM1 and PKM2 in mouse and human prostatic tissues, including developing, benign and cancerous prostate. We found that PKM2 was the predominant isoform expressed throughout the prostate development and PCa progression, with slightly reduced expression in some NEPCa cases. PKM1 was mostly expressed in stroma cells but low levels PKM1 was also detected in prostate basal epithelial cells. PKM1 was also expressed in a subset of NEPCa specimens. Additionally, we identified ten PKM isoforms that express exon 9 (PKM1-like) or exon 10 (PKM2-like). Some of these isoforms showed notable expression levels in PCa cell lines. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding PKMs' role in PCa carcinogenesis and NEPCa progression. The distinct expression patterns of PKM isoforms in different prostate cancer subtypes may offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies and precision medicine.\nT cells in testicular germ cell tumors: new evidence of fundamental contributions by rare subsets\nAuthors: Islam, R.; Heyer, J.; Figura, M.; Wang, X.; Nie, X.; Nathaniel, B.; Indumathy, S.; Hartmann, K.; Pleuger, C.; Fijak, M.; Kliesch, S.; Dittmar, F.; Pilatz, A.; Wagenlehner, F.; Hedger, M.; Loveland, B.; Hotaling, J. H.; Guo, J.; Loveland, K.; Schuppe, H.-C.; Fietz, D.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559963\nBACKGROUND: Immune cell infiltration is heterogeneous but common in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) and pre-invasive germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). Tumor-infiltrating T cells including regulatory T (Treg) and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are found in other cancer entities, but their contributions to TGCT are unknown. METHODS: Human testis specimens from independent patient cohorts were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with special emphasis on delineating T cell subtypes. RESULTS: Profound changes in immune cell composition within TGCT, shifting from macrophages in normal testes to T cells plus B and dendritic cells in TGCT, were documented. In most samples (96 {per thousand}), the CD4+ T cell frequency exceeded that of CD8+ cells, with decreasing numbers from central to peripheral tumor areas, and to tumor-free, contralateral testes. T cells including Treg and Tfh were most abundant in seminoma compared to mixed tumors and embryonal carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Despite considerable heterogeneity between patients, T cell subtypes form a key part of the TGCT microenvironment. The novel finding of rare Treg and Tfh cells in human testis suggests their involvement in TGCT pathobiology, with implications for understanding tumor progression, to assess patients' prognosis, and as putative targets for personalized immunotherapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Intratumor heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity drive tumour progression and therapy resistance. Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNA can drive exceptionally high dosage of MYC and afford cancer cells rapid adaptation to microenvironmental changes. The continued maintenance of extrachromosomal MYC is uniquely ensured by the presence of the selective pressure. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors, with the highest MYC levels correlating with squamous-like phenotypes. Our work provides the first detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment and management of cancers. However, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in breast cancer is limited due to lack of efficacy. Sialylation, the modification of glycans with sialic acid, is frequently upregulated in various cancer types and has potent immunoregulatory properties. However, its specific role in breast cancer immune evasion has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer sialylation drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, thus hampering the efficient eradication of tumors by CD8&#43; T cells. Notably, abrogation of tumor sialylation, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only facilitated CD8-mediated tumor control but also enabled the recruitment of Tcf7&#43; memory T cells. Significantly, abrogation of sialylation sensitized PD-1-resistant breast tumors to immunotherapy. Sialylation interference was well-tolerated in mammary development and function. We further demonstrate that hyper-sialylation occurs in over half of human breast cancers and correlates with poor T cell infiltration. Our results establish sialylation as a central immunoregulator in breast cancer, orchestrating multiple pathways that ultimately culminate in immune evasion. Importantly, our study underscores the potential of targeting this pathway to enhance tumor control, converting immunologically inert tumors into inflamed ones, and prime tumors for synergistic interventions involving immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has quickly risen to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death. This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining local delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-dependent tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8&#43; T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC.

SUMMARYCombining senescence-inducing MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists leads to interferon-driven and cytotoxic T cell-mediated PDAC control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Angiosarcoma (AS) is a vascular sarcoma that is highly aggressive and metastatic. Due to its rarity, treatment options for patients are limited, therefore more research is needed to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities. We previously found that conditional deletion of Dicer1 drives AS development in mice. Given the role of DICER1 in canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, this suggests that miRNA loss is important in AS development. After testing miRNAs previously suggested to have a tumor-suppressive role in AS, microRNA-497-5p (miR-497) suppressed cell viability most significantly. We also found that miR-497 overexpression led to significantly reduced cell migration and tumor formation. To understand the mechanism of miR-497 in tumor suppression, we identified clinically relevant target genes using a combination of RNA-sequencing data in an AS cell line, expression data from AS patients, and target prediction algorithms. We validated miR-497 direct regulation of CCND2, CDK6, and VAT1. One of these genes, VAT1, is an understudied protein that has been suggested to promote cell migration and metastasis in other cancers. Indeed, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of VAT1 with the natural product Neocarzilin A reduces AS migration. This work provides insight into the mechanisms of miR-497 and its target genes in AS pathogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer research has predominantly targeted genetic mutations, while only recently has attention shifted to understanding tumor cell-stages. However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mesenchymal plasticity has been extensively described in advanced and metastatic epithelial cancers; however, its functional role in malignant progression, metastatic dissemination and therapy response is controversial. More importantly, the role of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumor heterogeneity, clonal selection and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Functionally, our work clarifies the contribution of EMT to malignant progression and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. We leveraged ad hoc somatic mosaic genome engineering, lineage tracing and ablation technologies and dynamic genetic reporters to trace and ablate tumor-specific lineages along the phenotypic spectrum of epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity. The experimental evidences clarify the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution and metastatic dissemination. Spatial genomic analysis combined with single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of epithelial and mesenchymal lineages reveals that EMT promotes with the emergence of chromosomal instability (CIN). Specifically tumor lineages with mesenchymal features display highly conserved patterns of genomic evolution including complex structural genomic rearrangements and chromotriptic events. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross species analysis of pancreatic and other human epithelial cancers. Mechanistically, we discovered that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, which in turn results in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Therefore, EMT favors the emergence of high-fitness tumor cells, strongly supporting the concept of a cell-state, lineage-restricted patterns of evolution, where cancer cell sub-clonal speciation is propagated to progenies only through restricted functional compartments. Restraining those evolutionary routes through genetic ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity and extinction of the derived lineages completely abrogates the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive form of human cancer.</p>

To better understand the tumor biology of the KRASG12C allele and possible bypass mechanisms, we developed a novel autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model. Compared to the classical KRASG12D PDAC model, the G12C model exhibit slower tumor growth, yet similar histopathological and molecular features. Aligned with clinical experience, G12Ci treatment of KRASG12C tumors produced modest impact despite stimulating a  hot tumor immune microenvironment. Immunoprofiling revealed that CD24, a  do-not-eat-me signal, is significantly upregulated on cancer cells upon G12Ci treatment. Blocking CD24 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and significantly sensitized tumors to G12Ci treatment. Similar findings were observed in KRASG12D-driven PDAC. Our study reveals common and distinct oncogenic KRAS allele-specific biology and identifies a clinically actionable adaptive mechanism that may improve the efficacy of oncogenic KRAS inhibitor therapy in PDAC.

SignificanceLack of faithful preclinical models limits the exploration of resistance mechanisms to KRASG12C inhibitor in PDAC. We generated an autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model, which revealed allele-specific biology of the KRASG12C during PDAC development. We identified CD24 as an actionable adaptive mechanisms in cancer cells induced upon KRASG12C inhibition and blocking CD24 sensitizes PDAC to KRAS inhibitors in preclinical models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) is the most aggressive type of prostate cancer. However, energy metabolism, one of the cancer hallmarks, in NEPC had not been well studied yet. Pyruvate kinase M (PKM), which catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, has two main splicing isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2. PKM2 is known to be upregulated in various cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPCa). In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and bioinformatic analysis to study the expression of PKM1 and PKM2 in mouse and human prostatic tissues, including developing, benign and cancerous prostate. We found that PKM2 was the predominant isoform expressed throughout the prostate development and PCa progression, with slightly reduced expression in some NEPCa cases. PKM1 was mostly expressed in stroma cells but low levels PKM1 was also detected in prostate basal epithelial cells. PKM1 was also expressed in a subset of NEPCa specimens. Additionally, we identified ten PKM isoforms that express exon 9 (PKM1-like) or exon 10 (PKM2-like). Some of these isoforms showed notable expression levels in PCa cell lines. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding PKMs&#39; role in PCa carcinogenesis and NEPCa progression. The distinct expression patterns of PKM isoforms in different prostate cancer subtypes may offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies and precision medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Immune cell infiltration is heterogeneous but common in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) and pre-invasive germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). Tumor-infiltrating T cells including regulatory T (Treg) and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are found in other cancer entities, but their contributions to TGCT are unknown. METHODS: Human testis specimens from independent patient cohorts were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with special emphasis on delineating T cell subtypes. RESULTS: Profound changes in immune cell composition within TGCT, shifting from macrophages in normal testes to T cells plus B and dendritic cells in TGCT, were documented. In most samples (96 {per thousand}), the CD4&#43; T cell frequency exceeded that of CD8&#43; cells, with decreasing numbers from central to peripheral tumor areas, and to tumor-free, contralateral testes. T cells including Treg and Tfh were most abundant in seminoma compared to mixed tumors and embryonal carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Despite considerable heterogeneity between patients, T cell subtypes form a key part of the TGCT microenvironment. The novel finding of rare Treg and Tfh cells in human testis suggests their involvement in TGCT pathobiology, with implications for understanding tumor progression, to assess patients&#39; prognosis, and as putative targets for personalized immunotherapy.</p>
