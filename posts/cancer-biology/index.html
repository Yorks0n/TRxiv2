H3K27M causes a global reduction in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 by inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity. Paradoxically, PRC2 is essential in DMG tumour cells where residual complex activity is required for oncogenic gene repression, although the molecular mechanisms acting downstream of PRC2 in this context are poorly understood. Here, we have discovered this oncogenic gene repression is mediated by specific canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) formations. By combining CRISPR screening, biochemical and chromatin mapping approaches with functional perturbations we show that cPRC1 complexes containing CBX4 and PCGF4 drive oncogenic gene repression downstream of H3K27me3 in DMG cells. Remarkably, the altered H3K27me3 modification landscape characteristic of these tumours rewires the distribution of cPRC1 complexes on chromatin. CBX4 and PCGF4 containing cPRC1 accumulate at sites of H3K27me3 while other cPRC1 formations are displaced. Despite accounting for \u003c5% of cPRC1 complexes in DMG, CBX4/PCGF4-containing complexes predominate as gene repressors. Our findings link the altered distribution of H3K27me3 with imbalanced cPRC1 function, promoting oncogenic gene repression in DMG cells, revealing new disease mechanisms and highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities in this incurable childhood brain tumour.\nMetabolism-focused CRISPR screen unveils Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier 1 as a critical driver for PARP inhibitor resistance in lung cancer\nAuthors: Furusawa, T.; Cavero, R.; Liu, Y.; Li, H.; Xu, X.; Andresson, T.; Reinhold, W.; White, O.; Boufraqech, M.; Meyer, T. J.; Hartmann, O.; Diefenbacher, M. E.; Pommier, Y.; Weyemi, U.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569226\nHomologous recombination (HR) and poly ADP-ribosylation are partially redundant pathways for repair of DNA damage in normal and cancer cells. In cell lines that are deficient in HR, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1/2) is a proven target with several PARP inhibitors (PARPi) currently in clinical use. Resistance to PARP inhibitors often develops, usually involving genetic alterations in DNA repair signaling cascades, but also metabolic rewiring particularly in HR-proficient cells. PARP1/2 utilize NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), an essential substrate not only for PARPs but also for multiple pathways in cellular metabolism, TCA cycle and mitochondrial functions. Thus, NAD+ is central to many key cellular functions. Both activation of PARPs by DNA damage and their inhibition by drugs such as olaparib affect NAD+ consumption. We surmised that alterations in NAD+ metabolism by cancer drugs such as Olaparib might be involved in the development of resistance to drug therapy. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a metabolism-focused CRISPR knockout (KO) screen to identify genes which undergo alterations during treatment of tumor cells with PARP inhibitors. Of about 3000 genes in the screen, our data revealed that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) is an essential factor in desensitizing NSCLC lung cancer lines to PARP inhibition. In contrast to NSCLC lung cancer cells, triple negative breast cancer cells do not exhibit such desensitization following MPC1 loss and reprogram the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways to overcome PARP inhibitor treatment. Our findings unveil a previously unknown synergistic response between MPC1 loss and PARP inhibition in lung cancer cells.\nProtein tyrosine phosphatase receptor kappa regulates glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis to promote hepatocyte metabolic reprogramming in obesity\nAuthors: Gilglioni, E.

R.; Sharpe, H. J.; Trepo, E.; Wu, W.; Gurzov, E. N.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569004\nFat accumulation, de novo lipogenesis, and glycolysis are key drivers of hepatocyte reprogramming and the consequent metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Here we report that obesity leads to dysregulated expression of hepatic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTPRK was found to be increased in steatotic hepatocytes in both humans and mice, and positively correlated with PPAR{gamma}-induced lipogenic signalling. High-fat-fed PTPRK knockout mice displayed reduced weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation. Phosphoproteomic analysis in primary hepatocytes and hepatic metabolomics identified fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and glycolysis as PTPRK targets in metabolic reprogramming. Silencing PTPRK in hepatoma cell lines resulted in reduced colony-forming ability and PTPRK knockout mice developed smaller tumours after diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Our study defines a novel role for PTPRK in regulating hepatic glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and tumour development. PTPRK inhibition may provide therapeutic possibilities in obesity-associated liver diseases.

However, even highly homogenous tumors may display variability in their aggressiveness, and how immunologic-factors impinge on their aggressiveness remains understudied. Here we studied the mechanisms responsible for the immune-escape of murine tumors with low ITH. We compared the temporal growth of homogeneous, genetically-similar single-cell clones that are rejected vs. those that are not- rejected after transplantation in-vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping. Non- rejected clones showed high infiltration of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs), lower T-cell infiltration, and increased T-cell exhaustion compared to rejected clones. Comparative analysis of rejection- associated gene expression programs, combined with in-vivo CRISPR knockout screens of candidate mediators, identified Mif (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) as a regulator of immune rejection. Mif knockout led to smaller tumors and reversed non-rejection-associated immune composition, particularly, leading to the reduction of immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration. Finally, we validated these results in melanoma patient data. Statement of significanceHere, we uncover the association of Mif expression with tumor growth and aggressiveness, specifically in low ITH tumors. These findings could facilitate the development of new strategies to treat patients with homogeneous, high-MIF expressing tumors that are unresponsive to immune checkpoint therapy.\nOvercoming clinical resistance to EZH2 inhibition using rational epigenetic combination therapy\nAuthors: Kazansky, Y.; Cameron, D.; Mueller, H. S.; Demarest, P.; Zaffaroni, N.; Arrighetti, N.; Zuco, V.; Kuwahara, Y.; Somwar, R.; Ladanyi, M.; Qu, R.; De Stanchina, E.; Dela Cruz, F. S.; Kung, A. L.; Gounder, M.; Kentsis, A.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.06.527192\nEssential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on the functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general, and tazemetostat in particular, remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we sought to define molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas and rhabdoid tumors. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis and decouple EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition, and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. This also enables us to develop combination strategies to circumvent tazemetostat resistance using cell cycle bypass targeting via AURKB, and synthetic lethal targeting of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage repair via ATR. This reveals prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification, including PRICKLE1 associated with tazemetostat resistance. In all, this work offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials for epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and other epigenetically dysregulated cancers. SignificanceGenomic studies of patient epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and their cell lines identify mutations converging on a common pathway that is essential for response to EZH2 inhibition. Resistance mutations decouple drug-induced differentiation from cell cycle control. We identify complementary epigenetic combination strategies to overcome resistance and improve durability of response, supporting their investigation in clinical trials.\nIntratumoral Delivery of Chlorine Dioxide Exploits its ROS-like Properties: A Novel Paradigm for Effective Cancer Therapy\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Liu, Z.; Liu, X.; Liu, S.; Zhang, J.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568512\nReactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are potent oxidizing compounds renowned for their ability to eradicate cancer cells and facilitate tissue regeneration. In our research, we have discovered chlorine dioxide (CD), a substance that exhibits ROS-like properties and can be safely administered as a medicinal agent in the human body. Our study focuses on the utilization of intratumoral delivery of CD as a novel and efficacious approach for cancer therapy. Through intratumoral injections, CD selectively targets and eliminates cancer cells without promoting drug resistance. Furthermore, CD has demonstrated the capacity to elicit an immune response against cancer, thereby augmenting its therapeutic potential. We propose a groundbreaking paradigm for cancer treatment, employing intratumoral injections of CD, which holds great promise in prolonging the survival of cancer patients and transforming cancer into a manageable chronic condition. This approach harnesses the ROS-like properties of CD to effectively eradicate cancer cells while fostering tissue regeneration. By capitalizing on the unique characteristics of CD, we present a new avenue for enhancing patient outcomes in cancer therapy. Further research is warranted to optimize the administration protocols and dosage of CD, as well as to explore potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents. With ongoing investigation, the intratumoral delivery of CD represents a promising and innovative strategy for achieving effective cancer therapy.

The concept of Cancer Hallmarks distills this complexity into a set of underlying principles that govern tumor growth. Here, we exploit this abstraction to explore the physical distribution of Cancer Hallmarks across 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. We show that Hallmark activity is spatially organized-with 7 out of 13 Hallmarks consistently more active in cancer cells than within the non-cancerous tumor microenvironment (TME). The opposite is true for the remaining six Hallmarks. Additionally, we discovered that genomic distance between tumor subclones correlates with differences in Cancer Hallmark activity, even leading to clone-Hallmark specialization in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate interdependent relationships between Cancer Hallmarks at the junctions of TME and cancer compartments. In conclusion, including the spatial dimension, particularly through the lens of Cancer Hallmarks, can improve our understanding of tumor ecology. SignificanceWe explored Cancer Hallmarks in 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. This study unveiled spatial patterns in Hallmark activity, with some being more active in cancer cells and others in the non-cancerous tumor environment. Genomic distance impacted Hallmark activity, and we identified interdependencies at the TME-cancer junctions, improving our understanding of tumor ecology.\nProstate cancer-induced endothelial-to-osteoblast transition generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment\nAuthors: Lin, S.-H.; yu, g.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569496\nImmune checkpoint therapy has limited efficacy for patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC). In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that may account for the relative resistance of bmCRPC to immune checkpoint therapy. We found that prostate cancer (PCa)-induced bone via endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition causes an ingress of M2-like macrophages, leading to an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Analysis of a bmCRPC RNA-seq dataset revealed shorter overall survival in patients with an M2-high versus M2-low signature. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed CD206+ M2-like macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastasis. In osteogenic PCa xenografts, CD206+ macrophages were enriched adjacent to tumor-induced bone. FACS analysis showed an increase in CD206+ cells in osteogenic tumors compared to non-osteogenic tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the EC-to-OSB transition reduced aberrant bone and M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. RNAseq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from osteogenic (bone-TAMs) versus non-osteogenic (ctrl-TAMs) tumors showed high expression of an M2-like gene signature, canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and a decrease in an M1-like gene signature. Isolated bone-TAMs suppressed T-cell proliferation while ctrl-TAMs did not. Mechanistically, EC-OSB hybrid cells produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14 and LOX, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to bone-TME. Our study thus links the unique EC-to-OSB transition as an \"upstream\" event that drives \"downstream\" immunosuppression in the bone-TME. These studies suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit PCa-induced EC-to-OSB transition may reverse immunosuppression to promote immunotherapeutic outcomes in bmCRPC. SignificanceThe insight that prostate cancer-induced bone generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment offers a strategy to improve responses to immunotherapy approaches in patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\nMultivariate modeling of metabolic state vulnerabilities across diverse cancer contexts reveals synthetically lethal associations\nAuthors: Abecunas, C.; Fallahi-Sichani, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569098\nTargeting the distinct metabolic needs of tumor cells has recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The heterogeneous, context-dependent nature of cancer cell metabolism, however, poses challenges in identifying effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we utilize various unsupervised and supervised multivariate modeling approaches to systematically pinpoint recurrent metabolic states within hundreds of cancer cell lines, elucidate their association with tissue lineage and growth environments, and uncover vulnerabilities linked to their metabolic states across diverse genetic and tissue contexts. We validate key findings using data from an independent set of cell lines, pharmacological screens, and via single-cell analysis of patient-derived tumors. Our analysis uncovers new synthetically lethal associations between the tumor metabolic state (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation), driver mutations (e.g., loss of tumor suppressor PTEN), and actionable biological targets (e.g., mitochondrial electron transport chain). Investigating these relationships could inform the development of more precise and context-specific, metabolism-targeted cancer therapies.\nHypermetabolic state is associated with circadian rhythm disruption in mouse and human cancer cells\nAuthors: Iascone, D. M.; Zhang, X.; Bafford, P.; Mesaros, C.; Sela, Y.; Hofbauer, S.; Zhang, S. L.; Cook, K.; Pivarshev, P.; Stanger, B.; Anderson, S. A.; Dang, C. V.; Sehgal, A.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566310\nCrosstalk between cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms is a fundamental building block of multicellular life, and disruption of this reciprocal communication could be relevant to degenerative disease, including cancer. Here, we investigated whether maintenance of circadian rhythms depends upon specific metabolic pathways, particularly in the context of cancer. We found that in adult mouse fibroblasts, ATP levels were a major contributor to overall levels of a clock gene luciferase reporter, although not necessarily to the strength of circadian cycling. In contrast, we identified significant metabolic control of circadian function in an in vitro mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Metabolic profiling of a library of congenic tumor cell clones revealed significant differences in levels of lactate, pyruvate, ATP, and other crucial metabolites that we used to identify candidate clones with which to generate circadian reporter lines. Despite the shared genetic background of the clones, we observed diverse circadian profiles among these lines that varied with their metabolic phenotype: the most hypometabolic line had the strongest circadian rhythms while the most hypermetabolic line had the weakest rhythms. Treatment of these tumor cell lines with bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist shown to increase OxPhos, decreased the amplitude of circadian oscillation in a subset of tumor cell lines. Strikingly, treatment with the Complex I antagonist rotenone enhanced circadian rhythms only in the tumor cell line in which glycolysis was also low, thereby establishing a hypometabolic state. We further analyzed metabolic and circadian phenotypes across a panel of human patient-derived melanoma cell lines and observed a significant negative association between metabolic activity and circadian cycling strength. Together, these findings suggest that metabolic heterogeneity in cancer directly contributes to circadian function, and that high levels of glycolysis or OxPhos independently disrupt circadian rhythms in these cells.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a fatal childhood brain tumour characterised primarily by mutant histone H3 (H3K27M). H3K27M causes a global reduction in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 by inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity. Paradoxically, PRC2 is essential in DMG tumour cells where residual complex activity is required for oncogenic gene repression, although the molecular mechanisms acting downstream of PRC2 in this context are poorly understood. Here, we have discovered this oncogenic gene repression is mediated by specific canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) formations. By combining CRISPR screening, biochemical and chromatin mapping approaches with functional perturbations we show that cPRC1 complexes containing CBX4 and PCGF4 drive oncogenic gene repression downstream of H3K27me3 in DMG cells. Remarkably, the altered H3K27me3 modification landscape characteristic of these tumours rewires the distribution of cPRC1 complexes on chromatin. CBX4 and PCGF4 containing cPRC1 accumulate at sites of H3K27me3 while other cPRC1 formations are displaced. Despite accounting for &lt;5% of cPRC1 complexes in DMG, CBX4/PCGF4-containing complexes predominate as gene repressors. Our findings link the altered distribution of H3K27me3 with imbalanced cPRC1 function, promoting oncogenic gene repression in DMG cells, revealing new disease mechanisms and highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities in this incurable childhood brain tumour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Homologous recombination (HR) and poly ADP-ribosylation are partially redundant pathways for repair of DNA damage in normal and cancer cells. In cell lines that are deficient in HR, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1/2) is a proven target with several PARP inhibitors (PARPi) currently in clinical use. Resistance to PARP inhibitors often develops, usually involving genetic alterations in DNA repair signaling cascades, but also metabolic rewiring particularly in HR-proficient cells. PARP1/2 utilize NAD&#43; (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), an essential substrate not only for PARPs but also for multiple pathways in cellular metabolism, TCA cycle and mitochondrial functions. Thus, NAD&#43; is central to many key cellular functions. Both activation of PARPs by DNA damage and their inhibition by drugs such as olaparib affect NAD&#43; consumption. We surmised that alterations in NAD&#43; metabolism by cancer drugs such as Olaparib might be involved in the development of resistance to drug therapy. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a metabolism-focused CRISPR knockout (KO) screen to identify genes which undergo alterations during treatment of tumor cells with PARP inhibitors. Of about 3000 genes in the screen, our data revealed that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) is an essential factor in desensitizing NSCLC lung cancer lines to PARP inhibition. In contrast to NSCLC lung cancer cells, triple negative breast cancer cells do not exhibit such desensitization following MPC1 loss and reprogram the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways to overcome PARP inhibitor treatment. Our findings unveil a previously unknown synergistic response between MPC1 loss and PARP inhibition in lung cancer cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fat accumulation, de novo lipogenesis, and glycolysis are key drivers of hepatocyte reprogramming and the consequent metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Here we report that obesity leads to dysregulated expression of hepatic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTPRK was found to be increased in steatotic hepatocytes in both humans and mice, and positively correlated with PPAR{gamma}-induced lipogenic signalling. High-fat-fed PTPRK knockout mice displayed reduced weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation. Phosphoproteomic analysis in primary hepatocytes and hepatic metabolomics identified fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and glycolysis as PTPRK targets in metabolic reprogramming. Silencing PTPRK in hepatoma cell lines resulted in reduced colony-forming ability and PTPRK knockout mice developed smaller tumours after diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Our study defines a novel role for PTPRK in regulating hepatic glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and tumour development. PTPRK inhibition may provide therapeutic possibilities in obesity-associated liver diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Decreased intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) correlates with increased patient survival and immunotherapy response. However, even highly homogenous tumors may display variability in their aggressiveness, and how immunologic-factors impinge on their aggressiveness remains understudied. Here we studied the mechanisms responsible for the immune-escape of murine tumors with low ITH. We compared the temporal growth of homogeneous, genetically-similar single-cell clones that are rejected vs. those that are not- rejected after transplantation in-vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping. Non- rejected clones showed high infiltration of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs), lower T-cell infiltration, and increased T-cell exhaustion compared to rejected clones. Comparative analysis of rejection- associated gene expression programs, combined with in-vivo CRISPR knockout screens of candidate mediators, identified Mif (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) as a regulator of immune rejection. Mif knockout led to smaller tumors and reversed non-rejection-associated immune composition, particularly, leading to the reduction of immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration. Finally, we validated these results in melanoma patient data.

Statement of significanceHere, we uncover the association of Mif expression with tumor growth and aggressiveness, specifically in low ITH tumors. These findings could facilitate the development of new strategies to treat patients with homogeneous, high-MIF expressing tumors that are unresponsive to immune checkpoint therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Essential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on the functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general, and tazemetostat in particular, remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we sought to define molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas and rhabdoid tumors. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis and decouple EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition, and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. This also enables us to develop combination strategies to circumvent tazemetostat resistance using cell cycle bypass targeting via AURKB, and synthetic lethal targeting of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage repair via ATR. This reveals prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification, including PRICKLE1 associated with tazemetostat resistance. In all, this work offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials for epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and other epigenetically dysregulated cancers.

SignificanceGenomic studies of patient epithelioid sarcomas, rhabdoid tumors, and their cell lines identify mutations converging on a common pathway that is essential for response to EZH2 inhibition. Resistance mutations decouple drug-induced differentiation from cell cycle control. We identify complementary epigenetic combination strategies to overcome resistance and improve durability of response, supporting their investigation in clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are potent oxidizing compounds renowned for their ability to eradicate cancer cells and facilitate tissue regeneration. In our research, we have discovered chlorine dioxide (CD), a substance that exhibits ROS-like properties and can be safely administered as a medicinal agent in the human body. Our study focuses on the utilization of intratumoral delivery of CD as a novel and efficacious approach for cancer therapy. Through intratumoral injections, CD selectively targets and eliminates cancer cells without promoting drug resistance. Furthermore, CD has demonstrated the capacity to elicit an immune response against cancer, thereby augmenting its therapeutic potential. We propose a groundbreaking paradigm for cancer treatment, employing intratumoral injections of CD, which holds great promise in prolonging the survival of cancer patients and transforming cancer into a manageable chronic condition. This approach harnesses the ROS-like properties of CD to effectively eradicate cancer cells while fostering tissue regeneration. By capitalizing on the unique characteristics of CD, we present a new avenue for enhancing patient outcomes in cancer therapy. Further research is warranted to optimize the administration protocols and dosage of CD, as well as to explore potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents. With ongoing investigation, the intratumoral delivery of CD represents a promising and innovative strategy for achieving effective cancer therapy.

        <p class="abstract">Tumors are complex ecosystems with dozens of interacting cell types. The concept of Cancer Hallmarks distills this complexity into a set of underlying principles that govern tumor growth. Here, we exploit this abstraction to explore the physical distribution of Cancer Hallmarks across 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. We show that Hallmark activity is spatially organized-with 7 out of 13 Hallmarks consistently more active in cancer cells than within the non-cancerous tumor microenvironment (TME). The opposite is true for the remaining six Hallmarks. Additionally, we discovered that genomic distance between tumor subclones correlates with differences in Cancer Hallmark activity, even leading to clone-Hallmark specialization in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate interdependent relationships between Cancer Hallmarks at the junctions of TME and cancer compartments. In conclusion, including the spatial dimension, particularly through the lens of Cancer Hallmarks, can improve our understanding of tumor ecology.

SignificanceWe explored Cancer Hallmarks in 63 primary untreated tumors from 10 cancer types using spatial transcriptomics. This study unveiled spatial patterns in Hallmark activity, with some being more active in cancer cells and others in the non-cancerous tumor environment. Genomic distance impacted Hallmark activity, and we identified interdependencies at the TME-cancer junctions, improving our understanding of tumor ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune checkpoint therapy has limited efficacy for patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC). In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that may account for the relative resistance of bmCRPC to immune checkpoint therapy. We found that prostate cancer (PCa)-induced bone via endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition causes an ingress of M2-like macrophages, leading to an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Analysis of a bmCRPC RNA-seq dataset revealed shorter overall survival in patients with an M2-high versus M2-low signature. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed CD206&#43; M2-like macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastasis. In osteogenic PCa xenografts, CD206&#43; macrophages were enriched adjacent to tumor-induced bone. FACS analysis showed an increase in CD206&#43; cells in osteogenic tumors compared to non-osteogenic tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the EC-to-OSB transition reduced aberrant bone and M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. RNAseq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from osteogenic (bone-TAMs) versus non-osteogenic (ctrl-TAMs) tumors showed high expression of an M2-like gene signature, canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and a decrease in an M1-like gene signature. Isolated bone-TAMs suppressed T-cell proliferation while ctrl-TAMs did not. Mechanistically, EC-OSB hybrid cells produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14 and LOX, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to bone-TME. Our study thus links the unique EC-to-OSB transition as an &#34;upstream&#34; event that drives &#34;downstream&#34; immunosuppression in the bone-TME. These studies suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit PCa-induced EC-to-OSB transition may reverse immunosuppression to promote immunotherapeutic outcomes in bmCRPC.

SignificanceThe insight that prostate cancer-induced bone generates an immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment offers a strategy to improve responses to immunotherapy approaches in patients with bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting the distinct metabolic needs of tumor cells has recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The heterogeneous, context-dependent nature of cancer cell metabolism, however, poses challenges in identifying effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we utilize various unsupervised and supervised multivariate modeling approaches to systematically pinpoint recurrent metabolic states within hundreds of cancer cell lines, elucidate their association with tissue lineage and growth environments, and uncover vulnerabilities linked to their metabolic states across diverse genetic and tissue contexts. We validate key findings using data from an independent set of cell lines, pharmacological screens, and via single-cell analysis of patient-derived tumors. Our analysis uncovers new synthetically lethal associations between the tumor metabolic state (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation), driver mutations (e.g., loss of tumor suppressor PTEN), and actionable biological targets (e.g., mitochondrial electron transport chain). Investigating these relationships could inform the development of more precise and context-specific, metabolism-targeted cancer therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crosstalk between cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms is a fundamental building block of multicellular life, and disruption of this reciprocal communication could be relevant to degenerative disease, including cancer. Here, we investigated whether maintenance of circadian rhythms depends upon specific metabolic pathways, particularly in the context of cancer. We found that in adult mouse fibroblasts, ATP levels were a major contributor to overall levels of a clock gene luciferase reporter, although not necessarily to the strength of circadian cycling. In contrast, we identified significant metabolic control of circadian function in an in vitro mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Metabolic profiling of a library of congenic tumor cell clones revealed significant differences in levels of lactate, pyruvate, ATP, and other crucial metabolites that we used to identify candidate clones with which to generate circadian reporter lines. Despite the shared genetic background of the clones, we observed diverse circadian profiles among these lines that varied with their metabolic phenotype: the most hypometabolic line had the strongest circadian rhythms while the most hypermetabolic line had the weakest rhythms. Treatment of these tumor cell lines with bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist shown to increase OxPhos, decreased the amplitude of circadian oscillation in a subset of tumor cell lines. Strikingly, treatment with the Complex I antagonist rotenone enhanced circadian rhythms only in the tumor cell line in which glycolysis was also low, thereby establishing a hypometabolic state. We further analyzed metabolic and circadian phenotypes across a panel of human patient-derived melanoma cell lines and observed a significant negative association between metabolic activity and circadian cycling strength. Together, these findings suggest that metabolic heterogeneity in cancer directly contributes to circadian function, and that high levels of glycolysis or OxPhos independently disrupt circadian rhythms in these cells.</p>
