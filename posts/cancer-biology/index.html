CAFs are well-known to regulate the activity of diverse types of immune cells including T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, however little is known about their interaction with Natural killer (NK) cells, which constitute an important arm of anti-tumor immunity. Here we find, using mouse models of cancer and ex-vivo co-cultures, that CAFs inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. We unravel the mechanism by which this suppression occurs, through ligand-receptor engagement between NK cells and CAFs leading to CAF cytolysis, which in turn diminishes the expression of activating receptors on NK cells, promoting cancer escape from NK cell surveillance. Analysis of breast cancer patient samples reveals enrichment of NK cells in CAF-rich regions, and upregulation of NK binding ligands on CAFs which is correlated with poor disease outcome. These results reveal a CAF-mediated immunosuppressive decoy mechanism with implications for treatment of solid tumors.\nSingle-molecule systems for detection and monitoring of plasma circulating nucleosomes and oncoproteins in Diffuse Midline Glioma\nAuthors: Erez, N.; Furth, N.; Fedyuk, V.; Wadden, J.; Aittaleb, R.; Schwark, K.; Niculcea, M.; Miclea, M.; Mody, R.; Franson, A.; Eze, A.; Nourmohammadi, N.; Nazarian, J.; Venneti, S.; Koschmann, C.; Shema, E.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568019\nThe analysis of cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and proteins in the blood of cancer patients potentiates a new generation of non-invasive diagnostics and treatment monitoring approaches. However, confident detection of these tumor-originating markers is challenging, especially in the context of brain tumors, in which extremely low amounts of these analytes circulate in the patients plasma. Here, we applied a sensitive single-molecule technology to profile multiple histone modifications on millions of individual nucleosomes from the plasma of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) patients. The system reveals epigenetic patterns that are unique to DMG, significantly differentiating this group of patients from healthy subjects or individuals diagnosed with other cancer types. We further develop a method to directly capture and quantify the tumor-originating oncoproteins, H3-K27M and mutant p53, from the plasma of children diagnosed with DMG. This single-molecule system allows for accurate molecular classification of patients, utilizing less than 1ml of liquid-biopsy material. Furthermore, we show that our simple and rapid detection strategy correlates with MRI measurements and droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR) measurements of ctDNA, highlighting the utility of this approach for non-invasive treatment monitoring of DMG patients. This work underscores the clinical potential of single-molecule-based, multi-parametric assays for DMG diagnosis and treatment monitoring.\nBiocompatibility characterisation of CMOS-based Lab-on-Chip electrochemical sensors for in vitro cancer cell culture applications\nAuthors: Beykou, M.; Bousgouni, V.; Moser, N.; Georgiou, P.; Bakal, C.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568427\nLab-on-Chip electrochemical sensors, such as Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs), are being developed for use in point-of-care diagnostics, such as pH detection of tumour microenvironments, due to their integration with standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor technology. With this approach, the passivation of the CMOS process is used as a sensing layer to minimise post-processing, and Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) is the most common material at the microchip surface. ISFETs have the potential to be used for cell-based assays however, there is a poor understanding of the biocompatibility of microchip surfaces. Here, we quantitatively evaluated cell adhesion, morphogenesis, proliferation and mechano-responsiveness of both normal and cancer cells cultured on a Si3N4, sensor surface. We demonstrate that both normal and cancer cell adhesion decreased on Si3N4. Activation of the mechano-responsive transcription regulators, YAP/TAZ, are significantly decreased in cancer cells on Si3N4 in comparison to standard cell culture plastic, whilst proliferation marker, Ki67, expression markedly increased. Non-tumorigenic cells on chip showed less sensitivity to culture on Si3N4 than cancer cells. Treatment with extracellular matrix components increased cell adhesion in normal and cancer cell cultures, surpassing the adhesiveness of plastic alone. Moreover, poly-l-ornithine and laminin treatment restored YAP/TAZ levels in both non-tumorigenic and cancer cells to levels comparable to those observed on plastic. Thus, engineering the electrochemical sensor surface with treatments will provide a more physiologically relevant environment for future cell-based assay development on chip.\nNK cells shape the clonal evolution of B-ALL cells by IFN-γ production\nAuthors: Buri, M.

O.; Kovacic, B.; Hall-Glenn, F.; Urbanus, J.; Sippl, L.; Stofner, S.; Emminger, D.; Cosgrove, J.; Lehner, M.; Perie, L.; Shumacher, T. N.; Gotthardt, D.; Halbritter, F.; Putz, E. M.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567430\nThe term cancer immunoediting describes the dual role by which the immune system can both suppress and promote tumour growth and is divided into three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. While the importance of CD8+ T cells in all three phases of cancer immunoediting is well-established, the role of NK cells has mainly been attributed to the elimination phase. Here we show that NK cells play a prominent role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting. Extended co-culturing of DNA barcoded mouse BCR/ABLp185+ B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells with NK cells allowed for a quantitative measure of NK cell-mediated immunoediting in vitro. Whereas most tumour cell clones were efficiently eliminated by NK cells, a certain fraction of tumour cells harboured an intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, DNA barcoding revealed tumour cell clones with secondary resistance, which stochastically acquiring resistance to NK cells. We found that the production of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) rather than direct cytotoxicity by NK cells, led to the emergence of highly resistant tumour cells. Besides the well-known upregulation of components involved in major histocompatibility complex I surface expression, we also found novel genes that had not previously been linked to NK cell resistance in leukaemic cells, such as Ly6a and Plaat3. Our results demonstrate that tumour cells are actively edited during the equilibrium phase and use different avenues to escape NK cell-mediated eradication. Our findings provide a starting point to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat tumours that have successfully evaded from NK cell surveillance and to convert them into a controllable disease.\nNext-Gen Profiling of Tumor-resident Stem Cells using Machine learning\nAuthors: Chowdhury, D.; Neekhra, B.; Priyadarshi, S.; Mukherjee, S.; Maity, D.; Gupta, D.; Haldar, S.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568600\nTumor-resident stem cells, also known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), constitute a subgroup within tumors, play a crucial role in fostering resistance to treatment and the recurrence of tumors, and pose significant challenges for conventional therapeutic methods. Existing approaches for identifying CSCs face notable hurdles related to scalability, reproducibility, and technical consistency across different cancer types due to the adaptable nature of CSCs. In this context, we introduce OSCORP, an innovative machine-learning-driven approach. This methodology quantifies and identifies CSCs, achieving almost 99% accuracy using biopsy bulk RNAseq data. OSCORP leverages genetic similarities between normal and cancer stem cells. By categorizing CSCs into four distinct yet dynamic potency states, this approach provides insights into the differentiation landscape of CSCs, unveiling previously undisclosed facets of tumor heterogeneity. In evaluations conducted on patient samples across 22 cancer types, OSCORP revealed clinical, transcriptomic, and immunological signatures associated with each CSC state. It has emerged as a comprehensive tool for understanding and addressing the complexities of cancer stem cells. Ultimately, OSCORP opens up new possibilities for more effective personalized cancer therapies and holds the potential to serve as a clinical tool for monitoring patient-specific CSC changes during treatment or follow-up care.\nH2A.Z chaperones converge on histone H4 acetylation for melanoma cell proliferation\nAuthors: Jostes, S.; Vardabasso, C.; Dong, J.; Carcamo, S.; Singh, R.; Phelps, R.; Meadows, A.; Hasson, D.; Bernstein, E.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568747\nHigh levels of H2A.Z promote melanoma cell proliferation and correlate with poor prognosis. However, the role of the two distinct H2A.Z histone chaperone complexes, SRCAP and P400-TIP60, in melanoma remains unclear. Here, we show that individual depletion of SRCAP, P400, and VPS72 (YL1) not only results in loss of H2A.Z deposition into chromatin, but also a striking reduction of H4 acetylation in melanoma cells. This loss of H4 acetylation is found at the promoters of cell cycle genes directly bound by H2A.Z and its chaperones, suggesting a highly coordinated regulation between H2A.Z deposition and H4 acetylation to promote their expression. Knockdown of each of the three subunits downregulates E2F1 and its targets, resulting in a cell cycle arrest akin to H2A.Z depletion. However, unlike H2A.Z deficiency, loss of the shared H2A.Z chaperone subunit YL1 induces apoptosis. Furthermore, YL1 is overexpressed in melanoma tissues, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient outcome. Together, these findings provide a rationale for future targeting of H2A.Z chaperones as an epigenetic strategy for melanoma treatment.\nAmmonia inhibits antitumor activity of NK cells by decreasing mature perforin\nAuthors: Winiarska, M.; Domagala, J.; Grzywa, T.

Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the key host immunity components against malignant cells. Thus, they are currently extensively investigated in the field of immunotherapy of cancer. Different approaches have been developed to improve the antitumor activity of NK cells. Nonetheless, tumor microenvironment remains an obstacle to effective NK cell-based therapies. Here, we demonstrated that a cancer-conditioned medium suppresses the anti-tumor activity of NK cells. Further, we found that ammonia, a by-product of cancer cell metabolism, accumulates in the cancer-conditioned medium and tumor microenvironment. We identified that ammonia impairs the cytotoxicity of NK cells as well as the effectiveness of antibody-based and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK-based therapies in vitro. Inhibited activity of NK cells was caused by decreased levels of perforin. This effect was dependent on the lysosomotropic features of ammonia and its ability to increase pH in acidic compartments. In consequence, upon contact with ammonia the mature form of perforin was decreased in NK cells leading to their dysfunction. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to its previously described role of promoting tumor growth as a nitrogen source for tumor biomass ammonia could promote tumor escape as an NK cells immune checkpoint.

This concept was recently shown to be theoretically sound but has not been subjected to thorough mathematical analysis. Here we obtain quantitative estimates of tumour extinction probabilities using a deterministic analytical model and a stochastic simulation model of two-strike extinction therapy, based on evolutionary rescue theory. We find that the optimal time for the second strike is when the tumour is close to its minimum size before relapse. Given that this exact time point may be difficult to determine in practice, we show that striking slightly after the relapse has begun is typically better than switching too early. We further reveal and explain how demographic and environmental parameters influence the treatment outcome. Surprisingly, a low dose in the first strike paired with a high dose in the second is shown to be optimal. As one of the first investigations of extinction therapy, our work establishes a foundation for further theoretical and experimental studies of this promising evolutionarily-informed cancer treatment strategy.\nPreventing evolutionary rescue in cancer\nAuthors: Patil, S.; Viossat, Y.; Noble, R.

R.; Perkins, C. M.; Ratnayake, R.; Jiang, J.; Chen, Q.-Y.; Schmittgen, T. D.; Luesch, H.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.567685\nBackground: Acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM) is among the earliest initiating events in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. Methods: We developed a novel morphology-based screen using organoids from wildtype and p48Cre/+ (Cre) mice to discover epigenetic modulators that inhibit or reverse pancreatic ADM more effectively than the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Results: Of the 144 compounds screened, nine hits and two additional natural product HDAC inhibitors were validated by dose-response analysis. The class I HDAC inhibitors apicidin and FK228, and the histone methyltransferase inhibitor chaetocin demonstrated pronounced ADM inhibition and reversal without inducing significant cytotoxicity at 1 micromolar. Thioester prodrug class I HDAC inhibitor largazole attenuated ADM while its disulfide homodimer was effective in both ADM inhibition and reversal. Prioritized compounds were validated for ADM reversal in p48Cre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+ (KC) mouse organoids using both morphological and molecular endpoints. Molecular index analysis of ADM reversal in KC mouse organoids demonstrated improved activity compared to TSA. Improved prodrug stability translated into a stronger phenotypic and molecular response. RNA-sequencing indicated that angiotensinogen was the top inhibited pathway during ADM reversal. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a unique epigenetic mechanism and suggest that the phenotypic screen developed here may be applied to discover potential treatments for PDAC.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are among the most abundant components of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) and major contributors to immune modulation. CAFs are well-known to regulate the activity of diverse types of immune cells including T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, however little is known about their interaction with Natural killer (NK) cells, which constitute an important arm of anti-tumor immunity. Here we find, using mouse models of cancer and ex-vivo co-cultures, that CAFs inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. We unravel the mechanism by which this suppression occurs, through ligand-receptor engagement between NK cells and CAFs leading to CAF cytolysis, which in turn diminishes the expression of activating receptors on NK cells, promoting cancer escape from NK cell surveillance. Analysis of breast cancer patient samples reveals enrichment of NK cells in CAF-rich regions, and upregulation of NK binding ligands on CAFs which is correlated with poor disease outcome. These results reveal a CAF-mediated immunosuppressive decoy mechanism with implications for treatment of solid tumors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The analysis of cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and proteins in the blood of cancer patients potentiates a new generation of non-invasive diagnostics and treatment monitoring approaches. However, confident detection of these tumor-originating markers is challenging, especially in the context of brain tumors, in which extremely low amounts of these analytes circulate in the patients plasma. Here, we applied a sensitive single-molecule technology to profile multiple histone modifications on millions of individual nucleosomes from the plasma of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) patients. The system reveals epigenetic patterns that are unique to DMG, significantly differentiating this group of patients from healthy subjects or individuals diagnosed with other cancer types. We further develop a method to directly capture and quantify the tumor-originating oncoproteins, H3-K27M and mutant p53, from the plasma of children diagnosed with DMG. This single-molecule system allows for accurate molecular classification of patients, utilizing less than 1ml of liquid-biopsy material. Furthermore, we show that our simple and rapid detection strategy correlates with MRI measurements and droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR) measurements of ctDNA, highlighting the utility of this approach for non-invasive treatment monitoring of DMG patients. This work underscores the clinical potential of single-molecule-based, multi-parametric assays for DMG diagnosis and treatment monitoring.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lab-on-Chip electrochemical sensors, such as Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs), are being developed for use in point-of-care diagnostics, such as pH detection of tumour microenvironments, due to their integration with standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor technology. With this approach, the passivation of the CMOS process is used as a sensing layer to minimise post-processing, and Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) is the most common material at the microchip surface. ISFETs have the potential to be used for cell-based assays however, there is a poor understanding of the biocompatibility of microchip surfaces. Here, we quantitatively evaluated cell adhesion, morphogenesis, proliferation and mechano-responsiveness of both normal and cancer cells cultured on a Si3N4, sensor surface. We demonstrate that both normal and cancer cell adhesion decreased on Si3N4. Activation of the mechano-responsive transcription regulators, YAP/TAZ, are significantly decreased in cancer cells on Si3N4 in comparison to standard cell culture plastic, whilst proliferation marker, Ki67, expression markedly increased. Non-tumorigenic cells on chip showed less sensitivity to culture on Si3N4 than cancer cells. Treatment with extracellular matrix components increased cell adhesion in normal and cancer cell cultures, surpassing the adhesiveness of plastic alone. Moreover, poly-l-ornithine and laminin treatment restored YAP/TAZ levels in both non-tumorigenic and cancer cells to levels comparable to those observed on plastic. Thus, engineering the electrochemical sensor surface with treatments will provide a more physiologically relevant environment for future cell-based assay development on chip.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The term cancer immunoediting describes the dual role by which the immune system can both suppress and promote tumour growth and is divided into three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. While the importance of CD8&#43; T cells in all three phases of cancer immunoediting is well-established, the role of NK cells has mainly been attributed to the elimination phase. Here we show that NK cells play a prominent role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting. Extended co-culturing of DNA barcoded mouse BCR/ABLp185&#43; B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells with NK cells allowed for a quantitative measure of NK cell-mediated immunoediting in vitro. Whereas most tumour cell clones were efficiently eliminated by NK cells, a certain fraction of tumour cells harboured an intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, DNA barcoding revealed tumour cell clones with secondary resistance, which stochastically acquiring resistance to NK cells. We found that the production of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) rather than direct cytotoxicity by NK cells, led to the emergence of highly resistant tumour cells. Besides the well-known upregulation of components involved in major histocompatibility complex I surface expression, we also found novel genes that had not previously been linked to NK cell resistance in leukaemic cells, such as Ly6a and Plaat3. Our results demonstrate that tumour cells are actively edited during the equilibrium phase and use different avenues to escape NK cell-mediated eradication. Our findings provide a starting point to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat tumours that have successfully evaded from NK cell surveillance and to convert them into a controllable disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor-resident stem cells, also known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), constitute a subgroup within tumors, play a crucial role in fostering resistance to treatment and the recurrence of tumors, and pose significant challenges for conventional therapeutic methods. Existing approaches for identifying CSCs face notable hurdles related to scalability, reproducibility, and technical consistency across different cancer types due to the adaptable nature of CSCs. In this context, we introduce OSCORP, an innovative machine-learning-driven approach. This methodology quantifies and identifies CSCs, achieving almost 99% accuracy using biopsy bulk RNAseq data. OSCORP leverages genetic similarities between normal and cancer stem cells. By categorizing CSCs into four distinct yet dynamic potency states, this approach provides insights into the differentiation landscape of CSCs, unveiling previously undisclosed facets of tumor heterogeneity. In evaluations conducted on patient samples across 22 cancer types, OSCORP revealed clinical, transcriptomic, and immunological signatures associated with each CSC state. It has emerged as a comprehensive tool for understanding and addressing the complexities of cancer stem cells. Ultimately, OSCORP opens up new possibilities for more effective personalized cancer therapies and holds the potential to serve as a clinical tool for monitoring patient-specific CSC changes during treatment or follow-up care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High levels of H2A.Z promote melanoma cell proliferation and correlate with poor prognosis. However, the role of the two distinct H2A.Z histone chaperone complexes, SRCAP and P400-TIP60, in melanoma remains unclear. Here, we show that individual depletion of SRCAP, P400, and VPS72 (YL1) not only results in loss of H2A.Z deposition into chromatin, but also a striking reduction of H4 acetylation in melanoma cells. This loss of H4 acetylation is found at the promoters of cell cycle genes directly bound by H2A.Z and its chaperones, suggesting a highly coordinated regulation between H2A.Z deposition and H4 acetylation to promote their expression. Knockdown of each of the three subunits downregulates E2F1 and its targets, resulting in a cell cycle arrest akin to H2A.Z depletion. However, unlike H2A.Z deficiency, loss of the shared H2A.Z chaperone subunit YL1 induces apoptosis. Furthermore, YL1 is overexpressed in melanoma tissues, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient outcome. Together, these findings provide a rationale for future targeting of H2A.Z chaperones as an epigenetic strategy for melanoma treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immunotherapy revolutionized cancer treatment in the last decade. Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the key host immunity components against malignant cells. Thus, they are currently extensively investigated in the field of immunotherapy of cancer. Different approaches have been developed to improve the antitumor activity of NK cells. Nonetheless, tumor microenvironment remains an obstacle to effective NK cell-based therapies. Here, we demonstrated that a cancer-conditioned medium suppresses the anti-tumor activity of NK cells. Further, we found that ammonia, a by-product of cancer cell metabolism, accumulates in the cancer-conditioned medium and tumor microenvironment. We identified that ammonia impairs the cytotoxicity of NK cells as well as the effectiveness of antibody-based and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK-based therapies in vitro. Inhibited activity of NK cells was caused by decreased levels of perforin. This effect was dependent on the lysosomotropic features of ammonia and its ability to increase pH in acidic compartments. In consequence, upon contact with ammonia the mature form of perforin was decreased in NK cells leading to their dysfunction. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to its previously described role of promoting tumor growth as a nitrogen source for tumor biomass ammonia could promote tumor escape as an NK cells immune checkpoint.

        <p class="abstract">Extinction therapy aims to eradicate tumours by optimally scheduling multiple treatment strikes to exploit the vulnerability of small cell populations to stochastic extinction. This concept was recently shown to be theoretically sound but has not been subjected to thorough mathematical analysis. Here we obtain quantitative estimates of tumour extinction probabilities using a deterministic analytical model and a stochastic simulation model of two-strike extinction therapy, based on evolutionary rescue theory. We find that the optimal time for the second strike is when the tumour is close to its minimum size before relapse. Given that this exact time point may be difficult to determine in practice, we show that striking slightly after the relapse has begun is typically better than switching too early. We further reveal and explain how demographic and environmental parameters influence the treatment outcome. Surprisingly, a low dose in the first strike paired with a high dose in the second is shown to be optimal. As one of the first investigations of extinction therapy, our work establishes a foundation for further theoretical and experimental studies of this promising evolutionarily-informed cancer treatment strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extinction therapy aims to eradicate tumours by optimally scheduling multiple treatment strikes to exploit the vulnerability of small cell populations to stochastic extinction. This concept was recently shown to be theoretically sound but has not been subjected to thorough mathematical analysis. Here we obtain quantitative estimates of tumour extinction probabilities using a deterministic analytical model and a stochastic simulation model of two-strike extinction therapy, based on evolutionary rescue theory. We find that the optimal time for the second strike is when the tumour is close to its minimum size before relapse. Given that this exact time point may be difficult to determine in practice, we show that striking slightly after the relapse has begun is typically better than switching too early. We further reveal and explain how demographic and environmental parameters influence the treatment outcome. Surprisingly, a low dose in the first strike paired with a high dose in the second is shown to be optimal. As one of the first investigations of extinction therapy, our work establishes a foundation for further theoretical and experimental studies of this promising evolutionarily-informed cancer treatment strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM) is among the earliest initiating events in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. Methods: We developed a novel morphology-based screen using organoids from wildtype and p48Cre/&#43; (Cre) mice to discover epigenetic modulators that inhibit or reverse pancreatic ADM more effectively than the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Results: Of the 144 compounds screened, nine hits and two additional natural product HDAC inhibitors were validated by dose-response analysis. The class I HDAC inhibitors apicidin and FK228, and the histone methyltransferase inhibitor chaetocin demonstrated pronounced ADM inhibition and reversal without inducing significant cytotoxicity at 1 micromolar. Thioester prodrug class I HDAC inhibitor largazole attenuated ADM while its disulfide homodimer was effective in both ADM inhibition and reversal. Prioritized compounds were validated for ADM reversal in p48Cre/&#43;;LSL-KrasG12D/&#43; (KC) mouse organoids using both morphological and molecular endpoints. Molecular index analysis of ADM reversal in KC mouse organoids demonstrated improved activity compared to TSA. Improved prodrug stability translated into a stronger phenotypic and molecular response. RNA-sequencing indicated that angiotensinogen was the top inhibited pathway during ADM reversal. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a unique epigenetic mechanism and suggest that the phenotypic screen developed here may be applied to discover potential treatments for PDAC.</p>
