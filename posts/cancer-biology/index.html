Here we show an alternative and complementary hypothesis of tumor progression whereby physiological matrix stiffness affects the quantity and protein cargo of small EVs produced by cancer cells, which in turn drive their metastasis. Primary patient breast tissue produces significantly more EVs from stiff tumor tissue than soft tumor adjacent tissue. EVs released by cancer cells on matrices that model human breast tumors (25 kPa; stiff EVs) feature increased adhesion molecule presentation (ITG2{beta}1, ITG6{beta}4, ITG6{beta}1, CD44) compared to EVs from softer normal tissue (0.5 kPa; soft EVs), which facilitates their binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen IV, and a 3-fold increase in homing ability to distant organs in mice. In a zebrafish xenograft model, stiff EVs aid cancer cell dissemination through enhanced chemotaxis. Moreover, normal, resident lung fibroblasts treated with stiff and soft EVs change their gene expression profiles to adopt a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. These findings show that EV quantity, cargo, and function depend heavily on the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment.\nMAPS: Pathologist-level cell type annotation from tissue images through machine learning\nAuthors: Shaban, M.; Bai, Y.; Qiu, H.; Mao, S.; Yeung, J.; Yeo, Y. Y.; Shanmugam, V.; Shanmugam, V.; Chen, H.; Zhu, B.; Nolan, G. P.; Shipp, M. A.; Rodig, S. J.; Jiang, S.; Mahmood, F.\nScore: 26.8, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546474\nHighly multiplexed protein imaging is emerging as a potent technique for analyzing protein distribution within cells and tissues in their native context. However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension.\nEpigenomic analysis of Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded samples by CUT\u0026Tag\nAuthors: Henikoff, S.; Henikoff, J. G.; Ahmad, K.; Paranal, R. M.; Janssens, D. H.; Russell, Z. R.; Szulzewsky, F.; Kugel, S.; Holland, E. C.\nScore: 26.0, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545743\nFor more than a century, Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) sample preparation has been the preferred method for long-term preservation of biological material. However, the use of FFPE samples for epigenomic studies has been difficult because of chromatin damage from long exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde. Previously, we introduced Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chromatin (CUTAC), an antibody-targeted chromatin accessibility mapping protocol based on CUT\u0026Tag. Here we show that simple modifications of our single-tube CUTAC protocol are sufficient to produce high-resolution maps of paused RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) at enhancers and promoters using FFPE samples. We find that transcriptional regulatory element differences produced by FFPE-CUTAC distinguish between mouse brain tumor specimens and identify regulatory element markers with high confidence and precision. Our simple work-flow is suitable for automation, making possible affordable epigenomic profiling of archived biological samples for biomarker identification, clinical applications and retrospective studies.\nTherapy-associated remodeling of pancreatic cancer revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics and optimal transport analysis\nAuthors: Shiau, C.; Cao, J.; Gregory, M.

L.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546848\nIn combination with cell intrinsic properties, interactions in the tumor microenvironment modulate therapeutic response. We leveraged high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics to dissect the remodeling of multicellular neighborhoods and cell-cell interactions in human pancreatic cancer associated with specific malignant subtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy. We developed Spatially Constrained Optimal Transport Interaction Analysis (SCOTIA), an optimal transport model with a cost function that includes both spatial distance and ligand-receptor gene expression. Our results uncovered a marked change in ligand-receptor interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts and malignant cells in response to treatment, which was supported by orthogonal datasets, including an ex vivo tumoroid co-culture system. Overall, this study demonstrates that characterization of the tumor microenvironment using high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics allows for identification of molecular interactions that may play a role in the emergence of chemoresistance and establishes a translational spatial biology paradigm that can be broadly applied to other malignancies, diseases, and treatments.\nImmortalization and transformation of primary cells mediated by engineered ecDNAs\nAuthors: Pradella, D.; Zhang, M.; Gao, R.; Melissa, Y. A.; Gluchowska, K. M.; Cendon Florez, Y.; Mishra, T.; La Rocca, G.; Weigl, M.; Jiao, Z.; Nguyen, H. H. M.; Grimm, F.; Lisi, M.; Mastroleo, C.; Chen, K.; Luebeck, J.; Bafna, V.; Antonescu, C. R.; Ventura, A.\nScore: 41.2, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546239\nFocal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations, but their evolution and contribution to tumorigenesis have proven challenging to recapitulate in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general approach to engineer large (\u003e1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs, also known as \"double minutes\") in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cancer cell lines and in primary cells derived from genetically engineered mice. With this strategy, ecDNA formation can be coupled with expression of fluorescent reporters or other selectable markers to enable the identification and tracking of ecDNA-containing cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by engineering MDM2-containing ecDNAs in near-diploid human cells, showing that GFP expression can be used to track ecDNA dynamics under physiological conditions or in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harboring inducible Myc- and Mdm2-containing ecDNAs analogous to those spontaneously occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs rapidly accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting proliferation, immortalization, and transformation.\nDeep intravital brain tumor imaging enabled by tailored three-photon microscopy and analysis\nAuthors: Schubert, M. C.; Soyka, S. J.; Tamimi, A.; Maus, E.; Denninger, R.; Wissmann, N.; Reyhan, E.; Tetzlaff, S. K.; Beretta, C.; Drumm, M.; Schroers, J.; Steffens, A.; Walshon, J.; McCortney, K.; Heiland, S.; Golebiewska, A.; Kurz, F. T.; Wick, W.; Winkler, F.; Kreshuk, A.; Kuner, T.; Horbinski, C.; Prevedel, R.; Venkataramani, V.\nScore: 49.9, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.545350\nIntravital two-photon microscopy has emerged as a powerful technology to study brain tumor biology and its temporal dynamics, including invasion, proliferation and therapeutic resistance in the superficial layers of the mouse cortex. However, intravital microscopy of deeper cortical layers and especially the subcortical white matter, an important route of glioblastoma invasion and recurrence, has not yet been feasible due to low signal-to-noise ratios, missing spatiotemporal resolution and the inability to delineate myelinated axonal tracts. Here, we present a tailored intravital microscopy and artificial intelligence-based analysis methodology and workflow that enables routine deep imaging of glioblastoma over extended time periods, named Deep3P. We show that three-photon microscopy, adaptive optics, as well as customized deep learning-based denoising and machine learning segmentation together allow for deep brain intravital investigation of tumor biology up to 1.2 mm depth. Leveraging this approach, we find that perivascular invasion is a preferred invasion route into the corpus callosum as compared to intracortical glioblastoma invasion and uncover two vascular mechanisms of glioblastoma migration in the white matter. Furthermore, we can define an imaging biomarker of white matter disruption during early glioblastoma colonization. Taken together, Deep3P allows for an efficient and non-invasive investigation of brain tumor biology and its tumor microenvironment in unprecedented deep white and gray matter of the living mouse, opening up novel opportunities for studying the neuroscience of brain tumors and other model systems.\nMicroenvironmental Stiffness Induces Metabolic Reprogramming in Glioblastoma\nAuthors: Sohrabi, A.; Lefebvre, A. E. Y. T.; Harrison, M. J.; Condro, M. C.; Sanazzaro, T. M.; Safarians, G.; Solomon, I.; Bastola, S.; Kordbacheh, S.; Toh, N.; Kornblum, H. I.; Digman, M. A.; Seidlits, S. K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547558\nThe mechanical properties of solid tumors influence tumor cell phenotype and ability to invade into surrounding tissues. Using bioengineered scaffolds to provide a matrix microenvironment for patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) spheroids, this study demonstrates that a soft, brain-like matrix induces GBM cells to shift to a glycolysisweighted metabolic state which supports invasive behavior. We first show that orthotopic murine GBM tumors are stiffer than peri-tumoral brain tissues, but tumor stiffness is heterogenous where tumor edges are softer than the tumor core. Then, we developed three-dimensional scaffolds with -compressive moduli resembling either stiffer, tumor core or softer, peri-tumoral brain tissue. We demonstrate that the softer matrix microenvironment induces a shift in GBM cell metabolism toward glycolysis which manifests in lower proliferation rate and increased migration activities. Finally, we show that these mechanical cues are transduced from the matrix via CD44 and integrin receptors to induce metabolic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells.\nProteomic profiling identifies Serpin B9 as mediator of resistance to CAR T-cell and bispecific antibody treatment in B-cell lymphoma\nAuthors: Brinkmann, B. J.; Capraz, T.; Roider, T.; Knoll, M.; Kolb, C.; Liu, Y.; Angeli-Terzidou, A.-E.; Paramasivam, N.; Eckstein, V.; Sauer, T.; Schmitt, M.; Rosenwald, A.; Mueller-Tidow, C.; Huber, W.; Dietrich, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546507\nAlthough T-cell-engaging therapies are highly effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), responses are often not durable. To identify tumor-intrinsic drivers of resistance, we quantified in-vitro response to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CD19-CAR) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) across 46 B-NHL cell lines and measured their proteomic profiles at baseline. Among the proteins associated with poor in-vitro response was Serpin B9, an endogenous granzyme B inhibitor. Knock-out of SERPINB9 in cell lines with high intrinsic expression rendered them more susceptible to CD19-CAR and CD19-BsAb. Overexpression in cell lines with low intrinsic expression attenuated responses. Polatuzumab, vorinostat, lenalidomide, or checkpoint inhibitors improved response to CD19-CAR, although independently of Serpin B9 expression. Besides providing an important resource of therapy response and proteomic profiles, this study refines our understanding of resistance in T-cell engaging therapies, and suggests clinically relevant combination regimes.\nPancreatic Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Stimulate Schwann Cell Phenotype Indicative of Perineural Invasion via IL-8 Signaling\nAuthors: Gregory, E.; Powers, I.; Jamshidi-Parsian, A.; Griffin, R. J.; Song, Y.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546629\nPancreatic cancer remains a pre-eminent cause of cancer-related deaths with late-stage diagnoses leading to an 11% five-year survival rate. Moreover, perineural invasion (PNI), in which cancer cells migrate into adjacent nerves, occurs in an overwhelming majority of patients, further enhancing tumor metastasis. PNI has only recently been recognized as a key contributor to cancer progression; thus, there are insufficient treatment options for the disease. Attention has been focused on glial Schwann cells (SC) for their mediation of pancreatic PNI. Under stress, SCs dedifferentiate from their mature state to facilitate the repair of peripheral nerves; however, this signaling can also re-direct cancer cells to accelerate PNI. Limited research has explored the mechanism that causes this shift in SC phenotype in cancer. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEV) have been implicated in other avenues of cancer development, such as pre-metastatic niche formation in secondary locations, yet how TEVs contribute to PNI has not been fully explored. In this study, we highlight TEVs as initiators of SC activation into a PNI-associated phenotype. Proteomic and pathway assessments of TEVs revealed an elevation in interleukin-8 (IL-8) signaling and nuclear factor kappa B (NF{kappa}B) over healthy cell-derived EVs. TEV-treated SCs exhibited higher levels of activation markers, which were successfully neutralized with IL-8 inhibition. Additionally, TEVs increased NF{kappa}B subunit p65 nuclear translocation, which may lead to increased secretion of cytokines and proteases indicative of SC activation and PNI. These findings present a novel mechanism that may be targeted for the treatment of pancreatic cancer PNI. Statement of SignificanceIdentifying pancreatic tumor extracellular vesicles as key players in Schwann cell activation and perineural invasion by way of IL-8 will educate for more specialized and effective targets for an under-valued disease.\nMicrobiome Prevents Sudden Death Through Occult Cardiac Sub-micrometastasis in Mice\nAuthors: Aalam, S. M. M.; Tang, X.; PS, H.; Salem, S. M.; Al-jarrad, A.; Noseworthy, P. A.; Behfar, A.; Sadanandam, A.; Kalari, K. R.; Kashyap, P. C.; Kannan, N.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547566\nSudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) pose a formidable clinical challenge, and their underlying risk mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a gnotobiotic germ-free mouse model, we fortuitously discovered SCD incidences resulting from occult cardiac metastases. Female germ-free C57BL/6 mice (n=22) were raised in isolation and injected with mammary Py230 cells. Significantly higher SCD probabilities (36.3%) were observed in germ-free mice compared to gut-colonized groups (0%). Extensive examinations revealed no physical anomalies but demonstrated occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis in three out of four sudden death cases. Further analysis supported the role of occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis as the leading cause of SCDs. Remaining germ-free mice exhibited minimal primary tumors but high levels of cardiac metastases and morbidity. The gnotobiotic SCD model represents a crucial milestone in our understanding of the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the development of occult oncological processes that ultimately culminate in SCDs and warrants further investigation into their mechanisms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tissue stiffness is a critical prognostic factor in breast cancer and is associated with metastatic progression. Here we show an alternative and complementary hypothesis of tumor progression whereby physiological matrix stiffness affects the quantity and protein cargo of small EVs produced by cancer cells, which in turn drive their metastasis. Primary patient breast tissue produces significantly more EVs from stiff tumor tissue than soft tumor adjacent tissue. EVs released by cancer cells on matrices that model human breast tumors (25 kPa; stiff EVs) feature increased adhesion molecule presentation (ITG2{beta}1, ITG6{beta}4, ITG6{beta}1, CD44) compared to EVs from softer normal tissue (0.5 kPa; soft EVs), which facilitates their binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen IV, and a 3-fold increase in homing ability to distant organs in mice. In a zebrafish xenograft model, stiff EVs aid cancer cell dissemination through enhanced chemotaxis. Moreover, normal, resident lung fibroblasts treated with stiff and soft EVs change their gene expression profiles to adopt a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. These findings show that EV quantity, cargo, and function depend heavily on the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly multiplexed protein imaging is emerging as a potent technique for analyzing protein distribution within cells and tissues in their native context. However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For more than a century, Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) sample preparation has been the preferred method for long-term preservation of biological material. However, the use of FFPE samples for epigenomic studies has been difficult because of chromatin damage from long exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde. Previously, we introduced Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chromatin (CUTAC), an antibody-targeted chromatin accessibility mapping protocol based on CUT&amp;Tag. Here we show that simple modifications of our single-tube CUTAC protocol are sufficient to produce high-resolution maps of paused RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) at enhancers and promoters using FFPE samples. We find that transcriptional regulatory element differences produced by FFPE-CUTAC distinguish between mouse brain tumor specimens and identify regulatory element markers with high confidence and precision. Our simple work-flow is suitable for automation, making possible affordable epigenomic profiling of archived biological samples for biomarker identification, clinical applications and retrospective studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In combination with cell intrinsic properties, interactions in the tumor microenvironment modulate therapeutic response. We leveraged high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics to dissect the remodeling of multicellular neighborhoods and cell-cell interactions in human pancreatic cancer associated with specific malignant subtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy. We developed Spatially Constrained Optimal Transport Interaction Analysis (SCOTIA), an optimal transport model with a cost function that includes both spatial distance and ligand-receptor gene expression. Our results uncovered a marked change in ligand-receptor interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts and malignant cells in response to treatment, which was supported by orthogonal datasets, including an ex vivo tumoroid co-culture system. Overall, this study demonstrates that characterization of the tumor microenvironment using high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics allows for identification of molecular interactions that may play a role in the emergence of chemoresistance and establishes a translational spatial biology paradigm that can be broadly applied to other malignancies, diseases, and treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Focal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations, but their evolution and contribution to tumorigenesis have proven challenging to recapitulate in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general approach to engineer large (&gt;1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs, also known as &#34;double minutes&#34;) in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cancer cell lines and in primary cells derived from genetically engineered mice. With this strategy, ecDNA formation can be coupled with expression of fluorescent reporters or other selectable markers to enable the identification and tracking of ecDNA-containing cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by engineering MDM2-containing ecDNAs in near-diploid human cells, showing that GFP expression can be used to track ecDNA dynamics under physiological conditions or in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harboring inducible Myc- and Mdm2-containing ecDNAs analogous to those spontaneously occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs rapidly accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting proliferation, immortalization, and transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intravital two-photon microscopy has emerged as a powerful technology to study brain tumor biology and its temporal dynamics, including invasion, proliferation and therapeutic resistance in the superficial layers of the mouse cortex. However, intravital microscopy of deeper cortical layers and especially the subcortical white matter, an important route of glioblastoma invasion and recurrence, has not yet been feasible due to low signal-to-noise ratios, missing spatiotemporal resolution and the inability to delineate myelinated axonal tracts. Here, we present a tailored intravital microscopy and artificial intelligence-based analysis methodology and workflow that enables routine deep imaging of glioblastoma over extended time periods, named Deep3P. We show that three-photon microscopy, adaptive optics, as well as customized deep learning-based denoising and machine learning segmentation together allow for deep brain intravital investigation of tumor biology up to 1.2 mm depth. Leveraging this approach, we find that perivascular invasion is a preferred invasion route into the corpus callosum as compared to intracortical glioblastoma invasion and uncover two vascular mechanisms of glioblastoma migration in the white matter. Furthermore, we can define an imaging biomarker of white matter disruption during early glioblastoma colonization. Taken together, Deep3P allows for an efficient and non-invasive investigation of brain tumor biology and its tumor microenvironment in unprecedented deep white and gray matter of the living mouse, opening up novel opportunities for studying the neuroscience of brain tumors and other model systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanical properties of solid tumors influence tumor cell phenotype and ability to invade into surrounding tissues. Using bioengineered scaffolds to provide a matrix microenvironment for patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) spheroids, this study demonstrates that a soft, brain-like matrix induces GBM cells to shift to a glycolysisweighted metabolic state which supports invasive behavior. We first show that orthotopic murine GBM tumors are stiffer than peri-tumoral brain tissues, but tumor stiffness is heterogenous where tumor edges are softer than the tumor core. Then, we developed three-dimensional scaffolds with -compressive moduli resembling either stiffer, tumor core or softer, peri-tumoral brain tissue. We demonstrate that the softer matrix microenvironment induces a shift in GBM cell metabolism toward glycolysis which manifests in lower proliferation rate and increased migration activities. Finally, we show that these mechanical cues are transduced from the matrix via CD44 and integrin receptors to induce metabolic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although T-cell-engaging therapies are highly effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), responses are often not durable. To identify tumor-intrinsic drivers of resistance, we quantified in-vitro response to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CD19-CAR) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) across 46 B-NHL cell lines and measured their proteomic profiles at baseline. Among the proteins associated with poor in-vitro response was Serpin B9, an endogenous granzyme B inhibitor. Knock-out of SERPINB9 in cell lines with high intrinsic expression rendered them more susceptible to CD19-CAR and CD19-BsAb. Overexpression in cell lines with low intrinsic expression attenuated responses. Polatuzumab, vorinostat, lenalidomide, or checkpoint inhibitors improved response to CD19-CAR, although independently of Serpin B9 expression. Besides providing an important resource of therapy response and proteomic profiles, this study refines our understanding of resistance in T-cell engaging therapies, and suggests clinically relevant combination regimes.</p>

Moreover, perineural invasion (PNI), in which cancer cells migrate into adjacent nerves, occurs in an overwhelming majority of patients, further enhancing tumor metastasis. PNI has only recently been recognized as a key contributor to cancer progression; thus, there are insufficient treatment options for the disease. Attention has been focused on glial Schwann cells (SC) for their mediation of pancreatic PNI. Under stress, SCs dedifferentiate from their mature state to facilitate the repair of peripheral nerves; however, this signaling can also re-direct cancer cells to accelerate PNI. Limited research has explored the mechanism that causes this shift in SC phenotype in cancer. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEV) have been implicated in other avenues of cancer development, such as pre-metastatic niche formation in secondary locations, yet how TEVs contribute to PNI has not been fully explored. In this study, we highlight TEVs as initiators of SC activation into a PNI-associated phenotype. Proteomic and pathway assessments of TEVs revealed an elevation in interleukin-8 (IL-8) signaling and nuclear factor kappa B (NF{kappa}B) over healthy cell-derived EVs. TEV-treated SCs exhibited higher levels of activation markers, which were successfully neutralized with IL-8 inhibition. Additionally, TEVs increased NF{kappa}B subunit p65 nuclear translocation, which may lead to increased secretion of cytokines and proteases indicative of SC activation and PNI. These findings present a novel mechanism that may be targeted for the treatment of pancreatic cancer PNI.

Statement of SignificanceIdentifying pancreatic tumor extracellular vesicles as key players in Schwann cell activation and perineural invasion by way of IL-8 will educate for more specialized and effective targets for an under-valued disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) pose a formidable clinical challenge, and their underlying risk mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a gnotobiotic germ-free mouse model, we fortuitously discovered SCD incidences resulting from occult cardiac metastases. Female germ-free C57BL/6 mice (n=22) were raised in isolation and injected with mammary Py230 cells. Significantly higher SCD probabilities (36.3%) were observed in germ-free mice compared to gut-colonized groups (0%). Extensive examinations revealed no physical anomalies but demonstrated occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis in three out of four sudden death cases. Further analysis supported the role of occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis as the leading cause of SCDs. Remaining germ-free mice exhibited minimal primary tumors but high levels of cardiac metastases and morbidity. The gnotobiotic SCD model represents a crucial milestone in our understanding of the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the development of occult oncological processes that ultimately culminate in SCDs and warrants further investigation into their mechanisms.</p>
