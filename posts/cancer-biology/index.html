M.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558571\nImmunotherapies have revolutionized treatment and management of cancers. However, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in breast cancer is limited due to lack of efficacy. Sialylation, the modification of glycans with sialic acid, is frequently upregulated in various cancer types and has potent immunoregulatory properties. However, its specific role in breast cancer immune evasion has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer sialylation drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, thus hampering the efficient eradication of tumors by CD8+ T cells. Notably, abrogation of tumor sialylation, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only facilitated CD8-mediated tumor control but also enabled the recruitment of Tcf7+ memory T cells. Significantly, abrogation of sialylation sensitized PD-1-resistant breast tumors to immunotherapy. Sialylation interference was well-tolerated in mammary development and function. We further demonstrate that hyper-sialylation occurs in over half of human breast cancers and correlates with poor T cell infiltration. Our results establish sialylation as a central immunoregulator in breast cancer, orchestrating multiple pathways that ultimately culminate in immune evasion. Importantly, our study underscores the potential of targeting this pathway to enhance tumor control, converting immunologically inert tumors into inflamed ones, and prime tumors for synergistic interventions involving immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nIdentification of astrocyte-driven pseudolineages reveals clinical stratification and therapeutic targets in Glioblastoma\nAuthors: Foerster, L. C.; Kaya, O.; Wust, V.; Bekavac, M.; Ziegler, K. C.; Akcay, V.; Stinchcombe, N.; Gesteira Perez, N.; Ma, X.; Sadik, A.; Le, P. U.; Petrecca, K.; Opitz, C.; Liu, H.; Wirtz, C. R.; Anders, S.; Goncalves, A.; Martin-Villalba, A.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557713\nCancer research has predominantly targeted genetic mutations, while only recently has attention shifted to understanding tumor cell-stages. However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.\nDe novo purine metabolism is a metabolic vulnerability of cancers with low p16 expression\nAuthors: Tangudu, N. K.; Buj, R.; Wang, H.; Wang, J.; Cole, A. R.; Uboveja, A.; Fang, R.; Amalric, A.; Sajjakulnukit, P.; Lyons, M. A.; Cooper, K.; Hempel, N. W.; Snyder, N. W.; Lyssiotis, C. A.; Chandran, U. R.; Aird, K. M.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549149\np16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16/CDKN2A-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic human and mouse melanoma cell lines, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. In-deed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A ex-pression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16 knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16/Cdkn2a expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, includ-ing anti-folates. Tumors with p16 knockdown were more sensitive to the anti-folate methotrex-ate in vivo than control tumors. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16/CDKN2A-low tumors as loss of p16/CDKN2A may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.\nNanoparticle delivery of innate immune agonists combines with senescence-inducing agents to mediate T cell control of pancreatic cancer\nAuthors: Chibaya, L.; Lusi, C.

This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining local delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-dependent tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC. SUMMARYCombining senescence-inducing MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists leads to interferon-driven and cytotoxic T cell-mediated PDAC control.\nA resource-based mechanistic framework for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)\nAuthors: Vibishan, B.; BV, H.; Dey, S.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558379\nCancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC. HighlightsO_LICancer growth and progression can be driven by intra-tumour interactions. C_LIO_LIProstate cancer cells compete among each other for resources like testosterone and oxygen. C_LIO_LIWe model these interactions using a modified logistic model with resource dynamics. C_LIO_LIEquilibrium behaviour can be understood through resource supply and use efficiency.

We found that proteins initiating LLPS are frequently implicated in somatic cancers, even surpassing their involvement in neurodegeneration, where several such LLPS scaffolds are linked to disease emergence. Cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds are connected to all cancer hallmarks and tend to be oncogenes with dominant genetic effects currently lacking therapeutic options. Since most cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds exert their oncogenic effects as oncogenic fusion proteins (OFPs), we undertook a systematic analysis of known OFPs by assessing their module-level molecular functions. We identified both known and novel combinations of molecular functions that are specific to OFPs and thus have a high potential for driving tumorigenesis. Protein regions driving condensate formation show an increased association with DNA- or chromatin-binding domains of transcription regulators within OFPs, indicating a common molecular mechanism underlying several soft tissue sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies where phase-separation-prone OFPs form abnormal, ectopic condensates along the DNA, and thereby dysregulate gene expression programs.\nFGF19 and its analog Aldafermin cooperate with MYC to induce aggressive hepatocarcinogenesis\nAuthors: Ursic-Bedoya, J.; Desandre, G.; Chavey, C.; Marie, P.; Polizzi, A.; Riviere, B.; Guillou, H.; Assenat, E.; Hibner, U.; Gregoire, D.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557921\nFGF19 hormone has pleiotropic metabolic functions, notably the modulation of insulin sensitivity, glucose/lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. On top of its physiological metabolic role, FGF19 has been identified as a potentially targetable oncogenic driver, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, FGF19 remained an attractive candidate for treatment of metabolic disease, prompting the development of analogs uncoupling its metabolic and tumor-promoting activities. Using pre-clinical mice models of somatic mutation driven HCC, we assessed the oncogenicity of FGF19 in combination with frequent HCC tumorigenic alterations: p53 inactivation, CTNNB1 mutation, CCND1 or MYC overexpression. Our data revealed a strong oncogenic cooperation between FGF19 and MYC. Most importantly, we show that this oncogenic synergy is conserved with a FGF19-analog Aldafermin (NGM282), designed to solely mimic the hormones metabolic functions. In particular, even a short systemic treatment with recombinant proteins triggered rapid appearance of proliferative foci of MYC-expressing hepatocytes. The fact that FGF19 analog Aldafermin is not fully devoid of the hormones oncogenic properties raises concerns in the context of its potential use for patients with damaged, mutation-prone liver.\nKRAS inhibition activates an actionable CD24 do-not-eat-me signal in pancreas cancer\nAuthors: Wei, Y.; Liu, M.; Yen, E.-Y.; Yao, J.; Nguyen, P.

Identifying and targeting resistance mechanisms to G12Ci treatment is therefore crucial. To better understand the tumor biology of the KRASG12C allele and possible bypass mechanisms, we developed a novel autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model. Compared to the classical KRASG12D PDAC model, the G12C model exhibit slower tumor growth, yet similar histopathological and molecular features. Aligned with clinical experience, G12Ci treatment of KRASG12C tumors produced modest impact despite stimulating a hot tumor immune microenvironment. Immunoprofiling revealed that CD24, a do-not-eat-me signal, is significantly upregulated on cancer cells upon G12Ci treatment. Blocking CD24 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and significantly sensitized tumors to G12Ci treatment. Similar findings were observed in KRASG12D-driven PDAC. Our study reveals common and distinct oncogenic KRAS allele-specific biology and identifies a clinically actionable adaptive mechanism that may improve the efficacy of oncogenic KRAS inhibitor therapy in PDAC.\nCircadian regulation of MGMT expression and promoter methylation underlies daily rhythms in TMZ sensitivity in glioblastoma\nAuthors: Gonzalez-Aponte, M. F.; Damato, A. R.; Trebucq, L. L.; Simon, T.; Cardenas-Garcia, S. P.; Cho, K.; Patti, G. J.; Golombek, D. A.; Chiesa, J. J.; Herzog, E. D.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557630\nBackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite extensive research and clinical trials, median survival post-treatment remains at 15 months. Thus, all opportunities to optimize current treatments and improve patient outcomes should be considered. A recent retrospective clinical study found that taking TMZ in the morning compared to the evening was associated with a 6-month increase in median survival in patients with MGMT-methylated GBM. Here, we hypothesized that TMZ efficacy depends on time-of-day and O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in murine and human models of GBM. Methods and ResultsIn vitro recordings using real-time bioluminescence reporters revealed that GBM cells have intrinsic circadian rhythms in the expression of the core circadian clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, as well as in the DNA repair enzyme, MGMT. Independent measures of MGMT transcript levels and promoter methylation also showed daily rhythms intrinsic to GBM cells. These cells were more susceptible to TMZ when delivered at the daily peak of Bmal1 transcription. We found that in vivo morning administration of TMZ also decreased tumor size and increased body weight compared to evening drug delivery in mice bearing GBM xenografts. Finally, inhibition of MGMT activity with O6-Benzylguanine abrogated the daily rhythm in sensitivity to TMZ in vitro by increasing sensitivity at both the peak and trough of Bmal1 expression. ConclusionWe conclude that chemotherapy with TMZ can be dramatically enhanced by delivering at the daily maximum of tumor Bmal1 expression and minimum of MGMT activity.

G.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557579\nChordomas are cancers from the axial skeleton presenting immunological hallmarks of unknown significance. In recent years, some clinical trials demonstrated that chordomas can respond to immunotherapy. We present a comprehensive characterisation of immunological features of 76 chordomas through application of a multimodal approach comprising transcriptional profiling, multidimensional immunophenotyping and TCR profiling. Chordomas generally presented an immune \"hot\" microenvironment in comparison to other sarcomas, as indicated by the immunologic constant of rejection transcriptional signature. We identified two distinct groups of chordomas based on T cell infiltration. The highly infiltrated group was further characterised by high dendritic cell infiltration and the presence of multicellular immune aggregates in tumours, whereas low T cell infiltration was associated with lower overall cell densities of immune and stromal cells. Interestingly, patients with higher T cell infiltration displayed a more pronounced clonal enrichment of the T cell receptor repertoire compared to those with low T cell counts. Furthermore, we observed that the majority of chordomas maintained HLA class I expression. Our findings shed light on the natural immunity against chordomas. Understanding their immune landscape could guide the development and application of immunotherapies in a tailored manner, ultimately leading to an improved clinical outcome for chordoma patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment and management of cancers. However, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in breast cancer is limited due to lack of efficacy. Sialylation, the modification of glycans with sialic acid, is frequently upregulated in various cancer types and has potent immunoregulatory properties. However, its specific role in breast cancer immune evasion has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer sialylation drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, thus hampering the efficient eradication of tumors by CD8&#43; T cells. Notably, abrogation of tumor sialylation, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only facilitated CD8-mediated tumor control but also enabled the recruitment of Tcf7&#43; memory T cells. Significantly, abrogation of sialylation sensitized PD-1-resistant breast tumors to immunotherapy. Sialylation interference was well-tolerated in mammary development and function. We further demonstrate that hyper-sialylation occurs in over half of human breast cancers and correlates with poor T cell infiltration. Our results establish sialylation as a central immunoregulator in breast cancer, orchestrating multiple pathways that ultimately culminate in immune evasion. Importantly, our study underscores the potential of targeting this pathway to enhance tumor control, converting immunologically inert tumors into inflamed ones, and prime tumors for synergistic interventions involving immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer research has predominantly targeted genetic mutations, while only recently has attention shifted to understanding tumor cell-stages. However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">p16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16/CDKN2A-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic human and mouse melanoma cell lines, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. In-deed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A ex-pression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16 knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16/Cdkn2a expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, includ-ing anti-folates. Tumors with p16 knockdown were more sensitive to the anti-folate methotrex-ate in vivo than control tumors. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16/CDKN2A-low tumors as loss of p16/CDKN2A may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has quickly risen to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death. This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining local delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-dependent tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8&#43; T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC.

SUMMARYCombining senescence-inducing MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists leads to interferon-driven and cytotoxic T cell-mediated PDAC control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.

        <p class="abstract">Numerous cellular processes rely on biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), thus, perturbations of LLPS underlie various diseases. We found that proteins initiating LLPS are frequently implicated in somatic cancers, even surpassing their involvement in neurodegeneration, where several such LLPS scaffolds are linked to disease emergence. Cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds are connected to all cancer hallmarks and tend to be oncogenes with dominant genetic effects currently lacking therapeutic options. Since most cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds exert their oncogenic effects as oncogenic fusion proteins (OFPs), we undertook a systematic analysis of known OFPs by assessing their module-level molecular functions. We identified both known and novel combinations of molecular functions that are specific to OFPs and thus have a high potential for driving tumorigenesis. Protein regions driving condensate formation show an increased association with DNA- or chromatin-binding domains of transcription regulators within OFPs, indicating a common molecular mechanism underlying several soft tissue sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies where phase-separation-prone OFPs form abnormal, ectopic condensates along the DNA, and thereby dysregulate gene expression programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">FGF19 hormone has pleiotropic metabolic functions, notably the modulation of insulin sensitivity, glucose/lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. On top of its physiological metabolic role, FGF19 has been identified as a potentially targetable oncogenic driver, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, FGF19 remained an attractive candidate for treatment of metabolic disease, prompting the development of analogs uncoupling its metabolic and tumor-promoting activities.

Using pre-clinical mice models of somatic mutation driven HCC, we assessed the oncogenicity of FGF19 in combination with frequent HCC tumorigenic alterations: p53 inactivation, CTNNB1 mutation, CCND1 or MYC overexpression. Our data revealed a strong oncogenic cooperation between FGF19 and MYC. Most importantly, we show that this oncogenic synergy is conserved with a FGF19-analog Aldafermin (NGM282), designed to solely mimic the hormones metabolic functions. In particular, even a short systemic treatment with recombinant proteins triggered rapid appearance of proliferative foci of MYC-expressing hepatocytes.

The fact that FGF19 analog Aldafermin is not fully devoid of the hormones oncogenic properties raises concerns in the context of its potential use for patients with damaged, mutation-prone liver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">KRASG12C inhibitor (G12Ci) has produced encouraging, albeit modest and transient, clinical benefit in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Identifying and targeting resistance mechanisms to G12Ci treatment is therefore crucial. To better understand the tumor biology of the KRASG12C allele and possible bypass mechanisms, we developed a novel autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model. Compared to the classical KRASG12D PDAC model, the G12C model exhibit slower tumor growth, yet similar histopathological and molecular features. Aligned with clinical experience, G12Ci treatment of KRASG12C tumors produced modest impact despite stimulating a hot tumor immune microenvironment. Immunoprofiling revealed that CD24, a do-not-eat-me signal, is significantly upregulated on cancer cells upon G12Ci treatment. Blocking CD24 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and significantly sensitized tumors to G12Ci treatment. Similar findings were observed in KRASG12D-driven PDAC. Our study reveals common and distinct oncogenic KRAS allele-specific biology and identifies a clinically actionable adaptive mechanism that may improve the efficacy of oncogenic KRAS inhibitor therapy in PDAC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite extensive research and clinical trials, median survival post-treatment remains at 15 months. Thus, all opportunities to optimize current treatments and improve patient outcomes should be considered. A recent retrospective clinical study found that taking TMZ in the morning compared to the evening was associated with a 6-month increase in median survival in patients with MGMT-methylated GBM. Here, we hypothesized that TMZ efficacy depends on time-of-day and O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in murine and human models of GBM.

Methods and ResultsIn vitro recordings using real-time bioluminescence reporters revealed that GBM cells have intrinsic circadian rhythms in the expression of the core circadian clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, as well as in the DNA repair enzyme, MGMT. Independent measures of MGMT transcript levels and promoter methylation also showed daily rhythms intrinsic to GBM cells. These cells were more susceptible to TMZ when delivered at the daily peak of Bmal1 transcription. We found that in vivo morning administration of TMZ also decreased tumor size and increased body weight compared to evening drug delivery in mice bearing GBM xenografts. Finally, inhibition of MGMT activity with O6-Benzylguanine abrogated the daily rhythm in sensitivity to TMZ in vitro by increasing sensitivity at both the peak and trough of Bmal1 expression.

ConclusionWe conclude that chemotherapy with TMZ can be dramatically enhanced by delivering at the daily maximum of tumor Bmal1 expression and minimum of MGMT activity.

        <p class="abstract">Chordomas are cancers from the axial skeleton presenting immunological hallmarks of unknown significance. In recent years, some clinical trials demonstrated that chordomas can respond to immunotherapy. We present a comprehensive characterisation of immunological features of 76 chordomas through application of a multimodal approach comprising transcriptional profiling, multidimensional immunophenotyping and TCR profiling. Chordomas generally presented an immune &#34;hot&#34; microenvironment in comparison to other sarcomas, as indicated by the immunologic constant of rejection transcriptional signature. We identified two distinct groups of chordomas based on T cell infiltration. The highly infiltrated group was further characterised by high dendritic cell infiltration and the presence of multicellular immune aggregates in tumours, whereas low T cell infiltration was associated with lower overall cell densities of immune and stromal cells. Interestingly, patients with higher T cell infiltration displayed a more pronounced clonal enrichment of the T cell receptor repertoire compared to those with low T cell counts. Furthermore, we observed that the majority of chordomas maintained HLA class I expression. Our findings shed light on the natural immunity against chordomas. Understanding their immune landscape could guide the development and application of immunotherapies in a tailored manner, ultimately leading to an improved clinical outcome for chordoma patients.</p>
