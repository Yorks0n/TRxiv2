Here we show an alternative and complementary hypothesis of tumor progression whereby physiological matrix stiffness affects the quantity and protein cargo of small EVs produced by cancer cells, which in turn drive their metastasis. Primary patient breast tissue produces significantly more EVs from stiff tumor tissue than soft tumor adjacent tissue. EVs released by cancer cells on matrices that model human breast tumors (25 kPa; stiff EVs) feature increased adhesion molecule presentation (ITG2{beta}1, ITG6{beta}4, ITG6{beta}1, CD44) compared to EVs from softer normal tissue (0.5 kPa; soft EVs), which facilitates their binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen IV, and a 3-fold increase in homing ability to distant organs in mice. In a zebrafish xenograft model, stiff EVs aid cancer cell dissemination through enhanced chemotaxis. Moreover, normal, resident lung fibroblasts treated with stiff and soft EVs change their gene expression profiles to adopt a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. These findings show that EV quantity, cargo, and function depend heavily on the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment.\nRobust prediction of patient outcomes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for cancer using common clinical, pathologic, and genomic features\nAuthors: Chang, T.-G.; Cao, Y.; Sfreddo, H.; Dhruba, S. R.; Lee, S.-H.; Valero, C.; Yoo, S.-K.; Chowell, D.; Morris, L. G. T.; Ruppin, E.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547697\nDespite the revolutionary impact of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer treatment, accurately predicting patient responses remains elusive. We analyzed eight cohorts of 2881 ICB-treated patients across 18 solid tumor types, the largest dataset to date, examining diverse clinical, pathologic, and genomic features. We developed the LOgistic Regression-based Immunotherapy-response Score (LORIS) using a transparent, compact 6-feature logistic regression model. LORIS outperforms previous signatures in ICB response prediction and can identify responsive patients, even those with low tumor mutational burden or tumor PD-L1 expression. Importantly, LORIS consistently predicts both objective responses and short-term and long-term survival across most cancer types. Moreover, LORIS showcases a near-monotonic relationship with ICB response probability and patient survival, enabling more precise patient stratification across the board. As our method is accurate, interpretable, and only utilizes a few readily measurable features, we anticipate it will help improve clinical decision-making practices in precision medicine to maximize patient benefit.\nMachine-learning analysis of factors that shape cancer aneuploidy landscapes reveals an important role for negative selection\nAuthors: Jubran, J.; Slutsky, R.; Rozenblum, N.; Rokach, L.; Ben-David, U.; Yeger-Lotem, E.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547626\nAneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes within a cell, is considered a hallmark of cancer. Patterns of aneuploidy differ across cancers, yet are similar in cancers affecting closely-related tissues. The selection pressures underlying aneuploidy patterns are not fully understood, hindering our understanding of cancer development and progression. Here, we applied interpretable machine learning (ML) methods to study tissue-selective aneuploidy patterns. We defined 20 types of features of normal and cancer tissues, and used them to model gains and losses of chromosome-arms in 24 cancer types. In order to reveal the factors that shape the tissue-specific cancer aneuploidy landscapes, we interpreted the ML models by estimating the relative contribution of each feature to the models. While confirming known drivers of positive selection, our quantitative analysis highlighted the importance of negative selection for shaping the aneuploidy landscapes of human cancer. Tumor-suppressor gene density was a better predictor of gain patterns than oncogene density, and vice-versa for loss patterns. We identified the contribution of tissue-selective features and demonstrated them experimentally for chr13q gain in colon cancer. In line with an important role for negative selection in shaping the aneuploidy landscapes, we found compensation by paralogs to be a top predictor of chromosome-arm loss prevalence, and demonstrated this relationship for one such paralog interaction. Similar factors were found to shape aneuploidy patterns in human cancer cell lines, demonstrating their relevance for aneuploidy research. Overall, our quantitative, interpretable ML models improve the understanding of the genomic properties that shape cancer aneuploidy landscapes.\nSelective inhibition of interleukin-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) enhances anti-tumor immunity in association with Th1-skewing, cytotoxic T cell activation, and reduced T cell exhaustion\nAuthors: Hsu, L.-Y.; Rosenbaum, J. T.; Verner, E.; Jones, W. B.; Hill, C. M.; Janc, J. W.; Buggy, J. J.; Ding, N.; Reneau, J. C.; Khodadoust, M. S.; Kim, Y. H.; Wilcox, R. A.; Miller, R. A.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547822\nITK is a tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly by T lymphocytes. In mice, selective knock-out of the ITK gene produces Th1 skewing of T helper cell differentiation. We synthesized a covalent ITK inhibitor, soquelitinib, that binds ITK with greater than 100-fold selectivity compared to binding to resting lymphocyte kinase (RLK). In vitro studies with normal or malignant T cells demonstrated that soquelitinib suppresses Th2 cytokine production preferentially with relative sparing of Th1 cytokines. Soquelitinib inhibits the in vivo growth of several syngeneic murine tumors including those that do not express ITK. Treatment with soquelitinib leads to increased tumor infiltration of normal CD8+ cells that possess enhanced T effector function. Soquelitinib inhibited expression of T cell exhaustion markers and was able to restore T effector function to exhausted cells. Pharmacologic selective ITK inhibition may represent a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy.\nMicroenvironmental Stiffness Induces Metabolic Reprogramming in Glioblastoma\nAuthors: Sohrabi, A.; Lefebvre, A. E. Y. T.; Harrison, M. J.; Condro, M. C.; Sanazzaro, T. M.; Safarians, G.; Solomon, I.; Bastola, S.; Kordbacheh, S.; Toh, N.; Kornblum, H. I.; Digman, M. A.; Seidlits, S. K.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547558\nThe mechanical properties of solid tumors influence tumor cell phenotype and ability to invade into surrounding tissues. Using bioengineered scaffolds to provide a matrix microenvironment for patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) spheroids, this study demonstrates that a soft, brain-like matrix induces GBM cells to shift to a glycolysis-weighted metabolic state which supports invasive behavior. We first show that orthotopic murine GBM tumors are stiffer than peri-tumoral brain tissues, but tumor stiffness is heterogenous where tumor edges are softer than the tumor core. Then, we developed three-dimensional scaffolds with {micro}-compressive moduli resembling either stiffer, tumor core or softer, peri-tumoral brain tissue. We demonstrate that the softer matrix microenvironment induces a shift in GBM cell metabolism toward glycolysis which manifests in lower proliferation rate and increased migration activities. Finally, we show that these mechanical cues are transduced from the matrix via CD44 and integrin receptors to induce metabolic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells.\nProteomic profiling identifies Serpin B9 as mediator of resistance to CAR T-cell and bispecific antibody treatment in B-cell lymphoma\nAuthors: Brinkmann, B. J.; Capraz, T.; Roider, T.; Knoll, M.; Kolb, C.; Liu, Y.; Angeli-Terzidou, A.-E.; Paramasivam, N.; Eckstein, V.; Sauer, T.; Schmitt, M.; Rosenwald, A.; Mueller-Tidow, C.; Huber, W.; Dietrich, S.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546507\nAlthough T-cell-engaging therapies are highly effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), responses are often not durable. To identify tumor-intrinsic drivers of resistance, we quantified in-vitro response to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CD19-CAR) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) across 46 B-NHL cell lines and measured their proteomic profiles at baseline. Among the proteins associated with poor in-vitro response was Serpin B9, an endogenous granzyme B inhibitor. Knock-out of SERPINB9 in cell lines with high intrinsic expression rendered them more susceptible to CD19-CAR and CD19-BsAb. Overexpression in cell lines with low intrinsic expression attenuated responses. Polatuzumab, vorinostat, lenalidomide, or checkpoint inhibitors improved response to CD19-CAR, although independently of Serpin B9 expression. Besides providing an important resource of therapy response and proteomic profiles, this study refines our understanding of resistance in T-cell engaging therapies, and suggests clinically relevant combination regimes.\nSomatic mutation of Afadin leads to anchorage independent survival and metastatic growth of breast cancer through alpha E-catenin dependent destabilization of the adherens junction\nAuthors: Ratze, M. A.; Enserink, L. N.; Ishiyama, N.; Veldman, C.; Nijman, I. J.; Bernards, R. R.; van Diest, P. J.; Christgen, M.; Derksen, P. W.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547654\nLoss of E-cadherin (CDH1) and the adherens junction (AJ) drive development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancers (ILC). However, approximately 40% retain wild type CDH1 alleles, indicating that modulation of other genes attenuates the AJ during ILC etiology. To identify alternative drivers, we performed targeted sequencing in CDH1 wild type samples, based on a defined set of 100 AJ, tight junction, and desmosome genes we designated as the 'Adhesome'. In 146 ILC samples, we identified 62 cases (43%) with wild type CDH1 alleles in which we detected a total of 284 mutations in 36 Adhesome genes. After selection based on occurrence and potential loss of function, we identified an inactivating frameshift mutation in Afadin (AFDN; p.Lys630fs). Functional studies in E-cadherin-expressing breast cancer cells showed that Afadin knockout leads to immature AJs, and a non-cohesive phenotype accompanied by actomyosin dependent anoikis resistance, which are classical ILC hallmarks. Afadin reconstitutions show that F-actin organization critically depends on the alpha E-catenin binding CC domain. Afadin loss in intraductal xenograft mouse breast cancer models leads to ILC-type morphologies and overt lung metastases. AFDN truncate reconstitutions revealed that deletion of the C-terminal alpha E-catenin binding CC domain is sufficient to drive metastatic ILC. In conclusion, we identified and functionally coupled a somatic frameshift AFDN mutation in breast cancer to destabilization the epithelial AJ and the development of ILC hallmarks such as actomyosin-dependent anoikis resistance and single cell invasion. As such, Afadin represents a candidate tumor suppressor for E-cadherin-positive ILC development and progression.\nTherapy-associated remodeling of pancreatic cancer revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics and optimal transport analysis\nAuthors: Shiau, C.; Cao, J.; Gregory, M. T.; Gong, D.; Yin, X.; Cho, J.-W.; Wang, P. L.; Su, J.; Wang, S.; Reeves, J. W.; Kim, T. K.; Kim, Y.; Guo, J. A.; Lester, N. A.; Schurman, N.; Barth, J. L.; Weissleder, R.; Jacks, T.; Qadan, M.; Hong, T. S.; Wo, J. Y.; Roberts, H.; Beechem, J. M.; Fernandez-del Castillo, C.; Mino-Kenudson, M.; Ting, D. T.; Hemberg, M.; Hwang, W. L.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546848\nIn combination with cell intrinsic properties, interactions in the tumor microenvironment modulate therapeutic response. We leveraged high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics to dissect the remodeling of multicellular neighborhoods and cell-cell interactions in human pancreatic cancer associated with specific malignant subtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy. We developed Spatially Constrained Optimal Transport Interaction Analysis (SCOTIA), an optimal transport model with a cost function that includes both spatial distance and ligand-receptor gene expression. Our results uncovered a marked change in ligand-receptor interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts and malignant cells in response to treatment, which was supported by orthogonal datasets, including an ex vivo tumoroid co-culture system. Overall, this study demonstrates that characterization of the tumor microenvironment using high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics allows for identification of molecular interactions that may play a role in the emergence of chemoresistance and establishes a translational spatial biology paradigm that can be broadly applied to other malignancies, diseases, and treatments.\nMicrobiome Prevents Sudden Death Through Occult Cardiac Sub-micrometastasis in Mice\nAuthors: Aalam, S. M. M.; Tang, X.; PS, H.; Salem, S. M.; Al-jarrad, A.; Noseworthy, P. A.; Behfar, A.; Sadanandam, A.; Kalari, K. R.; Kashyap, P. C.; Kannan, N.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547566\nSudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) pose a formidable clinical challenge, and their underlying risk mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a gnotobiotic germ-free mouse model, we fortuitously discovered SCD incidences resulting from occult cardiac metastases. Female germ-free C57BL/6 mice (n=22) were raised in isolation and injected with mammary Py230 cells. Significantly higher SCD probabilities (36.3%) were observed in germ-free mice compared to gut-colonized groups (0%). Extensive examinations revealed no physical anomalies but demonstrated occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis in three out of four sudden death cases. Further analysis supported the role of occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis as the leading cause of SCDs. Remaining germ-free mice exhibited minimal primary tumors but high levels of cardiac metastases and morbidity. The gnotobiotic SCD model represents a crucial milestone in our understanding of the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the development of occult oncological processes that ultimately culminate in SCDs and warrants further investigation into their mechanisms.\nOn minimising tumoural growth under treatment resistance\nAuthors: Fischer, M. M.; Bluethgen, N.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547696\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrug resistance is a major challenge for curative cancer treatment, representing the main reason of death in patients. Evolutionary biology suggests pauses between treatment rounds as a way to delay or even avoid resistance emergence. Indeed, this approach has already shown promising preclinical and early clinical results, and stimulated the development of mathematical models for finding optimal treatment protocols. Due to their complexity, however, these models do not lend themself to a rigorous mathematical analysis, hence so far clinical recommendations generally relied on numerical simulations and ad-hoc heuristics. Here, we derive two mathematical models describing tumour growth under genetic and epigenetic treatment resistance, respectively, which are simple enough for a complete analytical investigation. First, we find key differences in response to treatment protocols between the two modes of resistance. Second, we identify the optimal treatment protocol which leads to the largest possible tumour shrinkage rate. Third, we fit the \"epigenetic model\" to previously published xenograft experiment data, finding excellent agreement, underscoring the biological validity of our approach. Finally, we use the fitted model to calculate the optimal treatment protocol for this specific experiment, which we demonstrate to cause curative treatment, making it superior to previous approaches which generally aimed at stabilising tumour burden. Overall, our approach underscores the usefulness of simple mathematical models and their analytical examination, and we anticipate our findings to guide future preclinical and, ultimately, clinical research in optimising treatment regimes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tissue stiffness is a critical prognostic factor in breast cancer and is associated with metastatic progression. Here we show an alternative and complementary hypothesis of tumor progression whereby physiological matrix stiffness affects the quantity and protein cargo of small EVs produced by cancer cells, which in turn drive their metastasis. Primary patient breast tissue produces significantly more EVs from stiff tumor tissue than soft tumor adjacent tissue. EVs released by cancer cells on matrices that model human breast tumors (25 kPa; stiff EVs) feature increased adhesion molecule presentation (ITG2{beta}1, ITG6{beta}4, ITG6{beta}1, CD44) compared to EVs from softer normal tissue (0.5 kPa; soft EVs), which facilitates their binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen IV, and a 3-fold increase in homing ability to distant organs in mice. In a zebrafish xenograft model, stiff EVs aid cancer cell dissemination through enhanced chemotaxis. Moreover, normal, resident lung fibroblasts treated with stiff and soft EVs change their gene expression profiles to adopt a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. These findings show that EV quantity, cargo, and function depend heavily on the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the revolutionary impact of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer treatment, accurately predicting patient responses remains elusive. We analyzed eight cohorts of 2881 ICB-treated patients across 18 solid tumor types, the largest dataset to date, examining diverse clinical, pathologic, and genomic features. We developed the LOgistic Regression-based Immunotherapy-response Score (LORIS) using a transparent, compact 6-feature logistic regression model. LORIS outperforms previous signatures in ICB response prediction and can identify responsive patients, even those with low tumor mutational burden or tumor PD-L1 expression. Importantly, LORIS consistently predicts both objective responses and short-term and long-term survival across most cancer types. Moreover, LORIS showcases a near-monotonic relationship with ICB response probability and patient survival, enabling more precise patient stratification across the board. As our method is accurate, interpretable, and only utilizes a few readily measurable features, we anticipate it will help improve clinical decision-making practices in precision medicine to maximize patient benefit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes within a cell, is considered a hallmark of cancer. Patterns of aneuploidy differ across cancers, yet are similar in cancers affecting closely-related tissues. The selection pressures underlying aneuploidy patterns are not fully understood, hindering our understanding of cancer development and progression. Here, we applied interpretable machine learning (ML) methods to study tissue-selective aneuploidy patterns. We defined 20 types of features of normal and cancer tissues, and used them to model gains and losses of chromosome-arms in 24 cancer types. In order to reveal the factors that shape the tissue-specific cancer aneuploidy landscapes, we interpreted the ML models by estimating the relative contribution of each feature to the models. While confirming known drivers of positive selection, our quantitative analysis highlighted the importance of negative selection for shaping the aneuploidy landscapes of human cancer. Tumor-suppressor gene density was a better predictor of gain patterns than oncogene density, and vice-versa for loss patterns. We identified the contribution of tissue-selective features and demonstrated them experimentally for chr13q gain in colon cancer. In line with an important role for negative selection in shaping the aneuploidy landscapes, we found compensation by paralogs to be a top predictor of chromosome-arm loss prevalence, and demonstrated this relationship for one such paralog interaction. Similar factors were found to shape aneuploidy patterns in human cancer cell lines, demonstrating their relevance for aneuploidy research. Overall, our quantitative, interpretable ML models improve the understanding of the genomic properties that shape cancer aneuploidy landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ITK is a tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly by T lymphocytes. In mice, selective knock-out of the ITK gene produces Th1 skewing of T helper cell differentiation. We synthesized a covalent ITK inhibitor, soquelitinib, that binds ITK with greater than 100-fold selectivity compared to binding to resting lymphocyte kinase (RLK). In vitro studies with normal or malignant T cells demonstrated that soquelitinib suppresses Th2 cytokine production preferentially with relative sparing of Th1 cytokines. Soquelitinib inhibits the in vivo growth of several syngeneic murine tumors including those that do not express ITK. Treatment with soquelitinib leads to increased tumor infiltration of normal CD8&#43; cells that possess enhanced T effector function. Soquelitinib inhibited expression of T cell exhaustion markers and was able to restore T effector function to exhausted cells. Pharmacologic selective ITK inhibition may represent a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanical properties of solid tumors influence tumor cell phenotype and ability to invade into surrounding tissues. Using bioengineered scaffolds to provide a matrix microenvironment for patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) spheroids, this study demonstrates that a soft, brain-like matrix induces GBM cells to shift to a glycolysis-weighted metabolic state which supports invasive behavior. We first show that orthotopic murine GBM tumors are stiffer than peri-tumoral brain tissues, but tumor stiffness is heterogenous where tumor edges are softer than the tumor core. Then, we developed three-dimensional scaffolds with {micro}-compressive moduli resembling either stiffer, tumor core or softer, peri-tumoral brain tissue. We demonstrate that the softer matrix microenvironment induces a shift in GBM cell metabolism toward glycolysis which manifests in lower proliferation rate and increased migration activities. Finally, we show that these mechanical cues are transduced from the matrix via CD44 and integrin receptors to induce metabolic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although T-cell-engaging therapies are highly effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), responses are often not durable. To identify tumor-intrinsic drivers of resistance, we quantified in-vitro response to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CD19-CAR) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) across 46 B-NHL cell lines and measured their proteomic profiles at baseline. Among the proteins associated with poor in-vitro response was Serpin B9, an endogenous granzyme B inhibitor. Knock-out of SERPINB9 in cell lines with high intrinsic expression rendered them more susceptible to CD19-CAR and CD19-BsAb. Overexpression in cell lines with low intrinsic expression attenuated responses. Polatuzumab, vorinostat, lenalidomide, or checkpoint inhibitors improved response to CD19-CAR, although independently of Serpin B9 expression. Besides providing an important resource of therapy response and proteomic profiles, this study refines our understanding of resistance in T-cell engaging therapies, and suggests clinically relevant combination regimes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) and the adherens junction (AJ) drive development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancers (ILC). However, approximately 40% retain wild type CDH1 alleles, indicating that modulation of other genes attenuates the AJ during ILC etiology. To identify alternative drivers, we performed targeted sequencing in CDH1 wild type samples, based on a defined set of 100 AJ, tight junction, and desmosome genes we designated as the &#39;Adhesome&#39;. In 146 ILC samples, we identified 62 cases (43%) with wild type CDH1 alleles in which we detected a total of 284 mutations in 36 Adhesome genes. After selection based on occurrence and potential loss of function, we identified an inactivating frameshift mutation in Afadin (AFDN; p.Lys630fs). Functional studies in E-cadherin-expressing breast cancer cells showed that Afadin knockout leads to immature AJs, and a non-cohesive phenotype accompanied by actomyosin dependent anoikis resistance, which are classical ILC hallmarks. Afadin reconstitutions show that F-actin organization critically depends on the alpha E-catenin binding CC domain. Afadin loss in intraductal xenograft mouse breast cancer models leads to ILC-type morphologies and overt lung metastases. AFDN truncate reconstitutions revealed that deletion of the C-terminal alpha E-catenin binding CC domain is sufficient to drive metastatic ILC. In conclusion, we identified and functionally coupled a somatic frameshift AFDN mutation in breast cancer to destabilization the epithelial AJ and the development of ILC hallmarks such as actomyosin-dependent anoikis resistance and single cell invasion. As such, Afadin represents a candidate tumor suppressor for E-cadherin-positive ILC development and progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In combination with cell intrinsic properties, interactions in the tumor microenvironment modulate therapeutic response. We leveraged high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics to dissect the remodeling of multicellular neighborhoods and cell-cell interactions in human pancreatic cancer associated with specific malignant subtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy. We developed Spatially Constrained Optimal Transport Interaction Analysis (SCOTIA), an optimal transport model with a cost function that includes both spatial distance and ligand-receptor gene expression. Our results uncovered a marked change in ligand-receptor interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts and malignant cells in response to treatment, which was supported by orthogonal datasets, including an ex vivo tumoroid co-culture system. Overall, this study demonstrates that characterization of the tumor microenvironment using high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics allows for identification of molecular interactions that may play a role in the emergence of chemoresistance and establishes a translational spatial biology paradigm that can be broadly applied to other malignancies, diseases, and treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) pose a formidable clinical challenge, and their underlying risk mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a gnotobiotic germ-free mouse model, we fortuitously discovered SCD incidences resulting from occult cardiac metastases. Female germ-free C57BL/6 mice (n=22) were raised in isolation and injected with mammary Py230 cells. Significantly higher SCD probabilities (36.3%) were observed in germ-free mice compared to gut-colonized groups (0%). Extensive examinations revealed no physical anomalies but demonstrated occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis in three out of four sudden death cases. Further analysis supported the role of occult cardiac sub-micrometastasis as the leading cause of SCDs. Remaining germ-free mice exhibited minimal primary tumors but high levels of cardiac metastases and morbidity. The gnotobiotic SCD model represents a crucial milestone in our understanding of the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the development of occult oncological processes that ultimately culminate in SCDs and warrants further investigation into their mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrug resistance is a major challenge for curative cancer treatment, representing the main reason of death in patients. Evolutionary biology suggests pauses between treatment rounds as a way to delay or even avoid resistance emergence. Indeed, this approach has already shown promising preclinical and early clinical results, and stimulated the development of mathematical models for finding optimal treatment protocols. Due to their complexity, however, these models do not lend themself to a rigorous mathematical analysis, hence so far clinical recommendations generally relied on numerical simulations and ad-hoc heuristics. Here, we derive two mathematical models describing tumour growth under genetic and epigenetic treatment resistance, respectively, which are simple enough for a complete analytical investigation. First, we find key differences in response to treatment protocols between the two modes of resistance. Second, we identify the optimal treatment protocol which leads to the largest possible tumour shrinkage rate. Third, we fit the &#34;epigenetic model&#34; to previously published xenograft experiment data, finding excellent agreement, underscoring the biological validity of our approach. Finally, we use the fitted model to calculate the optimal treatment protocol for this specific experiment, which we demonstrate to cause curative treatment, making it superior to previous approaches which generally aimed at stabilising tumour burden. Overall, our approach underscores the usefulness of simple mathematical models and their analytical examination, and we anticipate our findings to guide future preclinical and, ultimately, clinical research in optimising treatment regimes.</p>
