A.; Rawat, V.; Sheldon, R.; Ben-Sahra, I.; Frasor, J.; Sorger, P. K.; DeNicola, G. M.; Coloff, J. L.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561530\nThe non-essential amino acid serine is a critical nutrient for cancer cells due to its diverse biosynthetic functions. While some tumors can synthesize serine de novo, others are auxotrophic for serine and therefore reliant on the uptake of exogenous serine. Importantly, however, the transporter(s) that mediate serine uptake in cancer cells are not known. Here, we characterize the amino acid transporter ASCT2 (coded for by the gene SLC1A5) as the primary serine transporter in cancer cells. ASCT2 is well- known as a glutamine transporter in cancer, and our work demonstrates that serine and glutamine compete for uptake through ASCT2. We further show that ASCT2-mediated serine uptake is essential for purine nucleotide biosynthesis and that ER promotes serine uptake by directly activating SLC1A5 transcription. Together, our work defines an additional important role for ASCT2 as a serine transporter in cancer and evaluates ASCT2 as a potential therapeutic target in serine metabolism.\nChromosome 8 gain drives cancer progression by hijacking the translation factor 4E-BP1 sensitizing for targeted CDK4/6 inhibition\nAuthors: Funk, C.

M.; Romero-Perez, L.; Krijgsveld, J.; Cidre-Aranaz, F.; Gruenewald, T. G. P.; Musa, J.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.11.519935\nChromosome 8 (chr8) gains are common in cancer. However, their potential contribution to tumor heterogeneity is largely unexplored. Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is characterized by pathognomonic FET::ETS fusions, but show a general paucity of other recurrent somatic mutations that could explain the observed clinical diversity. In EwS, chr8 gains are the second most common genetic alteration rendering EwS an ideal model to investigate the relevance of chr8 gains in an otherwise silent genomic context. Here, we report that chr8 gain-driven gene expression patterns correlate with poor overall survival of EwS patients. This effect is predominantly mediated by increased expression of the translation initiation factor binding protein 4E-BP1 encoded by EIF4EBP1 on chr8. High EIF4EBP1 expression showed the strongest association with poor overall patient survival among all chr8-encoded genes and correlated with chr8 gains in EwS tumors. Similar findings were made in numerous entities of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the EwS model, silencing of 4E-BP1 reduced cell proliferation, clonogenicity, spheroidal growth in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo. Integrated multi-omics profiling uncovered that 4E-BP1 orchestrates a multifunctional proteomic network including hubs affecting RNA processing, translational regulation, and chromatin modification. Drug screens and functional assays revealed that high 4E-BP1 expression sensitizes for pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition in preclinical models. Collectively, we establish chr8 gains and high 4E-BP1 expression as prognostic biomarkers in EwS and demonstrate that their association with poor patient outcome is primarily mediated by 4E-BP1 orchestrating a multifunctional proteomic network sensitizing EwS for CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our data suggest that testing for chr8 gain may improve risk-stratification and therapeutic management in EwS and other cancers.\nTelomeres control regulation of the human Telomerase (hTERT) gene through non-telomeric TRF2 and independent of Telomere looping\nAuthors: Sengupta, A.; Vinayagamurthy, S.; Soni, D.; Deb, R.; Mukherjee, A. K.; Dutta, S.; Jaiswal, J.; Yadav, M.; Sharma, S.; Bagri, S.; Roy, S. S.; Singh, A.; Khanna, D.; Bhatt, A. K.; Sharma, A.; Saurav, S.; Motiani, R. K.; Chowdhury, S.\nScore: 12.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561466\nActivation of human telomerase (hTERT) and resulting maintenance of telomeres is widely understood. Whether telomeres, on the other hand, influence hTERT regulation is relatively less studied. We found hTERT was transcriptionally up/down regulated depending on telomere length (TL), but independent of telomere looping. Cells from different tissues, engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in hTERT, respectively. Temporal increase of TL, followed by decrease over days, resulted in induction and subsequent repression of hTERT, supporting the causal role of TL. Further confirmed by TL-dependent promoter activity from exogenously inserted hTERT reporter. Mechanistically, we show non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the hTERT promoter to be TL-dependent. Promoter bound TRF2 recruited the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation. Together, these reveal a heretofore unaddressed model of telomere homeostasis in telomerase-positive cells, where TL-dependent hTERT levels in turn maintain long/short telomeres. This might help better understand telomere-related physiologies like cancer, ageing and pluripotency.\nONECUT2 Activates Diverse Resistance Drivers of Androgen Receptor-Independent Heterogeneity in Prostate Cancer\nAuthors: Qian, C.; Yang, Q.; Rotinen, M.; Huang, R.; Kim, h.; Gallent, B.; Yan, Y.; Cadaneanu, R. M.; Zhang, B.; Kaochar, S.; Freedland, S. J.; Posadas, E. M.; Ellis, L.; Di Vizio, D.; Morrissey, C.; Nelson, P. S.; Brady, L.; Murali, R.; Campbell, M. J.; Yang, W.; Knudsen, B. S.; Mostaghel, E. A.; Ye, H.; Garraway, I. P.; You, S.; Freeman, M. R.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560025\nAndrogen receptor- (AR-) indifference is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate cancer (PC). Here we demonstrate that the HOX/CUT transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 targets include the glucocorticoid receptor and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, among others. OC2 regulates gene expression by promoter binding, enhancement of chromatin accessibility, and formation of novel super-enhancers. OC2 also activates glucuronidation genes that irreversibly disable androgen, thereby evoking phenotypic heterogeneity indirectly by hormone depletion. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC. Our findings support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target this protein as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease.\nCellular landscape of adrenocortical carcinoma at single-nuclei resolution\nAuthors: Tourigny, D. S.; Altieri, B.; Secener, K. A.; Sbiera, S.; Schauer, M. P.; Arampatzi, P.; Herterich, S.; Sauer, S. S.; Fassnacht, M.; Ronchi, C. L.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561514\nAdrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare yet devastating tumour of the adrenal gland with a molecular pathology that remain incompletely understood. To gain novel insights into the cellular landscape of ACC, we generated single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data sets from twelve ACC tumour samples and analysed these alongside a previously published snRNA-seq data set from normal adrenal glands (NAGs). We find the ACC tumour microenvironment to be relatively devoid of immune cells compared to NAG tissues, consistent with known high tumour purity values for ACC as an immunologically ``cold'' tumour. Our analysis identifies three separate groups of ACC samples that are characterised by different relative compositions of adrenocortical cell types, including two populations (ACC 1 and ACC 2) that are specifically enriched in the most aggressive tumours and display hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dysregulated steroidogenesis, respectively. In addition to cell types associated with hypoxic and metabolic signatures (ACC 3 and ACC 4) prevalent among less-aggressive tumours, we also identified and validated a population of mitotically active adrenocortical cells (ACC M) strongly overexpressing genes POLQ and DIAPH3 that possibly supports the expansion of malignant cell lineages. The smallest identified ACC specific cell type, ACC 5, displays characteristics of increased proliferation and growth factor signalling, and is therefore a potential progenitor-like or cell-of-origin candidate for the different lineages involved in adrenocortical carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, linage tracing suggests the fate adopted by malignant adrenocortical cells upon differentiation appears to be at least partly associated with the copy number or allelic balance state of the imprinted DLK1/MEG3 genomic locus, which we verified by assessing DNA methylation status among samples from the three groups of tumours defined by their different cell type compositions. Our results therefore provide new insights into the cellular heterogeneity of ACC, indicating that genetic perturbations to a hierarchical cellular differentiation mechanism underlying healthy adrenocortical renewal and zonation may explain the molecular basis for disease pathogenesis.\nTesting Adaptive Therapy Protocols using Gemcitabine and Capecitabine on a Mouse Model of Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer\nAuthors: SEYEDI, S.; Teo, R.; Foster, L.; Saha, D.; Mina, L.; Northfelt, D.; Anderson, K. S.; Shibata, D.; Gatenby, R.; Cisneros, L.; Troan, B.; Anderson, A. R. A.; Maley, C. C.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558136\nHighly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER+ breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P \u003c 0.01) and combined drugs (P \u003c 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.\nMapping chromatin state and transcriptional response in CIC-DUX4 undifferentiated round cell sarcoma\nAuthors: Thomas, N.; Luck, C.; Shlimon, N.; Kriska Ponce, R.; Kosibaty, Z.; Okimoto, R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561932\nCIC-DUX4 is a rare and understudied transcription factor fusion oncoprotein. CIC-DUX4 co-opts native gene targets to drive a lethal form of human sarcoma. The molecular underpinnings that lead to oncogenic reprograming and CIC-DUX4 sarcomagenesis remain largely undefined. Through an integrative ChIP and RNA-Seq analysis using patient-derived CIC-DUX4 cells, we define CIC-DUX4 mediated chromatin states and function. We show that CIC-DUX4 primarily localizes to proximal and distal cis-regulatory elements where it associates with active histone marks. Our findings nominate key signaling pathways and molecular targets that enable CIC-DUX4 to mediate tumor cell survival. Collectively, our data demonstrate how the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein impacts chromatin state and transcriptional responses to drive an oncogenic program in undifferentiated sarcoma.\nExploring the tumor micro-environment in ovarian cancer histotypes and tumor sites\nAuthors: Xie, B.; Olalekan, S.; BACK, R.; Ashitey, N. A. A. A.; Basu, A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561344\nOvarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease consisting of at least five different histological subtypes with varying clinical features, cells of origin, molecular composition, risk factors, and treatments. While most single-cell studies have focused on High grade serous ovarian cancer, a comprehensive landscape of the constituent cell types and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment are yet to be established in the different ovarian cancer histotypes. Further characterization of tumor progression, metastasis, and various histotypes are also needed to connect molecular signatures to pathological grading for personalized diagnosis and tailored treatment. In this study, we leveraged high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing technology to elucidate the cellular compositions on 21 solid tumor samples collected from 12 patients with six ovarian cancer histotypes and both primary (ovaries) and metastatic (omentum, rectum) sites. The diverse collection allowed us to deconstruct the histotypes and tumor site-specific expression patterns of cells in the tumor and identify key marker genes and ligand-receptor pairs that are active in the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Our findings can be used in improving precision disease stratification and optimizing treatment options.\nGM-CSF and IL-3 expression increases immune engraftment and tumor infiltration in a humanized patient-derived xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma\nAuthors: Weinfurtner, K.; Tischfield, D.; Crainic, J.; Li, W.; Kaplan, D. E.; Gade, T. P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561117\nIntroductionImmunotherapy has shown promising results in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and relevant model systems are greatly needed to inform treatment paradigms. Transplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hematopoietic cells allows for the development of humanized patient derived xenografts (HIS PDXs); however, these models have limited development of myeloid lineages. We aimed to determine the impact of human GM-CSF and IL-3 expression on tumor immune cell infiltration and tumor growth in a HIS PDX model of HCC. Materials and MethodsHIS HCC PDXs were generated using NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R{gamma}null) and NOG-EXL (huGM-CSF/huIL-3 NOG) mice conditioned with 30mg/kg Busulfan and, 24 hours later, injected with 400,000 CD34+ cells isolated from human fetal livers. HCC tumor tissue from an established PDX line in Matrigel was then implanted subcutaneously (SQ). Immune engraftment was monitored by flow cytometry. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2cm and tumor, blood, liver, and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry. ResultsHIS NOG-EXL HCC mice demonstrated earlier and persistently increased huCD45+ peripheral blood immune cells compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with 12.1% vs 1.7% at tumor implantation (p\u003c0.0001) and 82.1% vs 43.8% at steady state (p\u003c0.0001). All major immune cell types were represented in both groups. There was no difference in tumor growth between HIS NOG HCC, HIS NOG-EXL HCC, and control NOG HCC tumors by latency (48.4, 45.5, and 50.5 days, respectively, p=0.63) or Gompertzian growth rates (0.32, 0.31, 0.40, respectively, p=0.68). At necropsy, HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice had increased huCD45+ immune cells in tumor (27.2% vs 8.6%, p=0.03) compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with increased CD4+ regulatory T cells (21.0% vs 11.1%, p=0.04), CD4+ T cell PD-1 expression (77.9% vs 49.4%, p=0.03), and M2 macrophage phenotype (36.1% vs 17.6%, p=0.04). ConclusionsHIS HCC PDX models demonstrate robust immune infiltration in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and SQ HCC tumor, especially in mice expressing human GM-CSF and IL-3. Expression of these human cytokines lead to increased tumor infiltrating immune cells with a higher proportion of regulatory immune cells, suggesting NOG-EXL mice may be a more appropriate model for preclinical trials with immunotherapy.\nTumor-targeted delivery of Tetanus toxoid by Listeria improves immunotherapy against ovarian cancer in mice\nAuthors: Scanlon, L. R.; Gabor, L.; Khouri, O. R.; Ahmad, S.; Levy, E.; Kuo, D. Y.-S.; Lin, K.; Nevadunsky, N.; Gravekamp, C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561944\nOvarian cancer is known for its poor neoantigen expression and strong immunosuppression. Here, we utilized an attenuated non-pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes delivering a highly immunogenic Tetanus Toxoid protein (Listeria-TT), as a neoantigen surrogate, inside tumors through infection in a metastatic mouse ovarian cancer model (Id8p53-/-Luc). Gemcitabine (GEM) was added to reduce immune suppression. Listeria-TT+GEM treatments resulted in tumors expressing TT and reactivation of pre-existing CD4 and CD8 memory T cells to TT (generated early in life), which were then attracted to the TT-expressing tumors and producing granzyme B and perforin. This correlated with a strong reduction in the ovary tumors and metastases, and a significant improvement of the survival time compared to all control groups. Moreover, two treatment cycles with Listeria-TT+GEM doubled the survival time compared to untreated mice. Checkpoint inhibitors have little effect on ovarian cancer partly because of low neoantigen expression. We evaluated if delivery of TT by Listeria to the TME improved the effect of anti-PD1 antibodies. We found that Listeria-TT+GEM+PD1 was significantly more effective (efficacy and survival) than PD1 or Listeria-TT+GEM alone, and that more treatment cycles with Listeria-TT+GEM+PD1 significantly increased the survival time compared to Listeria-TT+GEM alone. In summary, the results of this study suggest that our approach may benefit ovarian cancer patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The non-essential amino acid serine is a critical nutrient for cancer cells due to its diverse biosynthetic functions. While some tumors can synthesize serine de novo, others are auxotrophic for serine and therefore reliant on the uptake of exogenous serine. Importantly, however, the transporter(s) that mediate serine uptake in cancer cells are not known. Here, we characterize the amino acid transporter ASCT2 (coded for by the gene SLC1A5) as the primary serine transporter in cancer cells. ASCT2 is well- known as a glutamine transporter in cancer, and our work demonstrates that serine and glutamine compete for uptake through ASCT2. We further show that ASCT2-mediated serine uptake is essential for purine nucleotide biosynthesis and that ER promotes serine uptake by directly activating SLC1A5 transcription. Together, our work defines an additional important role for ASCT2 as a serine transporter in cancer and evaluates ASCT2 as a potential therapeutic target in serine metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromosome 8 (chr8) gains are common in cancer. However, their potential contribution to tumor heterogeneity is largely unexplored. Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is characterized by pathognomonic FET::ETS fusions, but show a general paucity of other recurrent somatic mutations that could explain the observed clinical diversity. In EwS, chr8 gains are the second most common genetic alteration rendering EwS an ideal model to investigate the relevance of chr8 gains in an otherwise silent genomic context. Here, we report that chr8 gain-driven gene expression patterns correlate with poor overall survival of EwS patients. This effect is predominantly mediated by increased expression of the translation initiation factor binding protein 4E-BP1 encoded by EIF4EBP1 on chr8. High EIF4EBP1 expression showed the strongest association with poor overall patient survival among all chr8-encoded genes and correlated with chr8 gains in EwS tumors. Similar findings were made in numerous entities of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the EwS model, silencing of 4E-BP1 reduced cell proliferation, clonogenicity, spheroidal growth in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo. Integrated multi-omics profiling uncovered that 4E-BP1 orchestrates a multifunctional proteomic network including hubs affecting RNA processing, translational regulation, and chromatin modification. Drug screens and functional assays revealed that high 4E-BP1 expression sensitizes for pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition in preclinical models. Collectively, we establish chr8 gains and high 4E-BP1 expression as prognostic biomarkers in EwS and demonstrate that their association with poor patient outcome is primarily mediated by 4E-BP1 orchestrating a multifunctional proteomic network sensitizing EwS for CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our data suggest that testing for chr8 gain may improve risk-stratification and therapeutic management in EwS and other cancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Activation of human telomerase (hTERT) and resulting maintenance of telomeres is widely understood. Whether telomeres, on the other hand, influence hTERT regulation is relatively less studied. We found hTERT was transcriptionally up/down regulated depending on telomere length (TL), but independent of telomere looping. Cells from different tissues, engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in hTERT, respectively. Temporal increase of TL, followed by decrease over days, resulted in induction and subsequent repression of hTERT, supporting the causal role of TL. Further confirmed by TL-dependent promoter activity from exogenously inserted hTERT reporter. Mechanistically, we show non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the hTERT promoter to be TL-dependent. Promoter bound TRF2 recruited the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation. Together, these reveal a heretofore unaddressed model of telomere homeostasis in telomerase-positive cells, where TL-dependent hTERT levels in turn maintain long/short telomeres. This might help better understand telomere-related physiologies like cancer, ageing and pluripotency.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Androgen receptor- (AR-) indifference is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate cancer (PC). Here we demonstrate that the HOX/CUT transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 targets include the glucocorticoid receptor and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, among others. OC2 regulates gene expression by promoter binding, enhancement of chromatin accessibility, and formation of novel super-enhancers. OC2 also activates glucuronidation genes that irreversibly disable androgen, thereby evoking phenotypic heterogeneity indirectly by hormone depletion. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC. Our findings support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target this protein as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare yet devastating tumour of the adrenal gland with a molecular pathology that remain incompletely understood. To gain novel insights into the cellular landscape of ACC, we generated single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data sets from twelve ACC tumour samples and analysed these alongside a previously published snRNA-seq data set from normal adrenal glands (NAGs). We find the ACC tumour microenvironment to be relatively devoid of immune cells compared to NAG tissues, consistent with known high tumour purity values for ACC as an immunologically ``cold&#39;&#39; tumour. Our analysis identifies three separate groups of ACC samples that are characterised by different relative compositions of adrenocortical cell types, including two populations (ACC 1 and ACC 2) that are specifically enriched in the most aggressive tumours and display hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dysregulated steroidogenesis, respectively. In addition to cell types associated with hypoxic and metabolic signatures (ACC 3 and ACC 4) prevalent among less-aggressive tumours, we also identified and validated a population of mitotically active adrenocortical cells (ACC M) strongly overexpressing genes POLQ and DIAPH3 that possibly supports the expansion of malignant cell lineages. The smallest identified ACC specific cell type, ACC 5, displays characteristics of increased proliferation and growth factor signalling, and is therefore a potential progenitor-like or cell-of-origin candidate for the different lineages involved in adrenocortical carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, linage tracing suggests the fate adopted by malignant adrenocortical cells upon differentiation appears to be at least partly associated with the copy number or allelic balance state of the imprinted DLK1/MEG3 genomic locus, which we verified by assessing DNA methylation status among samples from the three groups of tumours defined by their different cell type compositions. Our results therefore provide new insights into the cellular heterogeneity of ACC, indicating that genetic perturbations to a hierarchical cellular differentiation mechanism underlying healthy adrenocortical renewal and zonation may explain the molecular basis for disease pathogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER&#43; breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P &lt; 0.01) and combined drugs (P &lt; 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CIC-DUX4 is a rare and understudied transcription factor fusion oncoprotein. CIC-DUX4 co-opts native gene targets to drive a lethal form of human sarcoma. The molecular underpinnings that lead to oncogenic reprograming and CIC-DUX4 sarcomagenesis remain largely undefined. Through an integrative ChIP and RNA-Seq analysis using patient-derived CIC-DUX4 cells, we define CIC-DUX4 mediated chromatin states and function. We show that CIC-DUX4 primarily localizes to proximal and distal cis-regulatory elements where it associates with active histone marks. Our findings nominate key signaling pathways and molecular targets that enable CIC-DUX4 to mediate tumor cell survival. Collectively, our data demonstrate how the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein impacts chromatin state and transcriptional responses to drive an oncogenic program in undifferentiated sarcoma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ovarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease consisting of at least five different histological subtypes with varying clinical features, cells of origin, molecular composition, risk factors, and treatments. While most single-cell studies have focused on High grade serous ovarian cancer, a comprehensive landscape of the constituent cell types and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment are yet to be established in the different ovarian cancer histotypes. Further characterization of tumor progression, metastasis, and various histotypes are also needed to connect molecular signatures to pathological grading for personalized diagnosis and tailored treatment. In this study, we leveraged high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing technology to elucidate the cellular compositions on 21 solid tumor samples collected from 12 patients with six ovarian cancer histotypes and both primary (ovaries) and metastatic (omentum, rectum) sites. The diverse collection allowed us to deconstruct the histotypes and tumor site-specific expression patterns of cells in the tumor and identify key marker genes and ligand-receptor pairs that are active in the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Our findings can be used in improving precision disease stratification and optimizing treatment options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionImmunotherapy has shown promising results in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and relevant model systems are greatly needed to inform treatment paradigms. Transplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hematopoietic cells allows for the development of humanized patient derived xenografts (HIS PDXs); however, these models have limited development of myeloid lineages. We aimed to determine the impact of human GM-CSF and IL-3 expression on tumor immune cell infiltration and tumor growth in a HIS PDX model of HCC.

Materials and MethodsHIS HCC PDXs were generated using NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R{gamma}null) and NOG-EXL (huGM-CSF/huIL-3 NOG) mice conditioned with 30mg/kg Busulfan and, 24 hours later, injected with 400,000 CD34&#43; cells isolated from human fetal livers. HCC tumor tissue from an established PDX line in Matrigel was then implanted subcutaneously (SQ). Immune engraftment was monitored by flow cytometry. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2cm and tumor, blood, liver, and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry.

ResultsHIS NOG-EXL HCC mice demonstrated earlier and persistently increased huCD45&#43; peripheral blood immune cells compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with 12.1% vs 1.7% at tumor implantation (p&lt;0.0001) and 82.1% vs 43.8% at steady state (p&lt;0.0001). All major immune cell types were represented in both groups. There was no difference in tumor growth between HIS NOG HCC, HIS NOG-EXL HCC, and control NOG HCC tumors by latency (48.4, 45.5, and 50.5 days, respectively, p=0.63) or Gompertzian growth rates (0.32, 0.31, 0.40, respectively, p=0.68). At necropsy, HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice had increased huCD45&#43; immune cells in tumor (27.2% vs 8.6%, p=0.03) compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with increased CD4&#43; regulatory T cells (21.0% vs 11.1%, p=0.04), CD4&#43; T cell PD-1 expression (77.9% vs 49.4%, p=0.03), and M2 macrophage phenotype (36.1% vs 17.6%, p=0.04).

ConclusionsHIS HCC PDX models demonstrate robust immune infiltration in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and SQ HCC tumor, especially in mice expressing human GM-CSF and IL-3. Expression of these human cytokines lead to increased tumor infiltrating immune cells with a higher proportion of regulatory immune cells, suggesting NOG-EXL mice may be a more appropriate model for preclinical trials with immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ovarian cancer is known for its poor neoantigen expression and strong immunosuppression. Here, we utilized an attenuated non-pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes delivering a highly immunogenic Tetanus Toxoid protein (Listeria-TT), as a neoantigen surrogate, inside tumors through infection in a metastatic mouse ovarian cancer model (Id8p53-/-Luc). Gemcitabine (GEM) was added to reduce immune suppression. Listeria-TT&#43;GEM treatments resulted in tumors expressing TT and reactivation of pre-existing CD4 and CD8 memory T cells to TT (generated early in life), which were then attracted to the TT-expressing tumors and producing granzyme B and perforin. This correlated with a strong reduction in the ovary tumors and metastases, and a significant improvement of the survival time compared to all control groups. Moreover, two treatment cycles with Listeria-TT&#43;GEM doubled the survival time compared to untreated mice. Checkpoint inhibitors have little effect on ovarian cancer partly because of low neoantigen expression. We evaluated if delivery of TT by Listeria to the TME improved the effect of anti-PD1 antibodies. We found that Listeria-TT&#43;GEM&#43;PD1 was significantly more effective (efficacy and survival) than PD1 or Listeria-TT&#43;GEM alone, and that more treatment cycles with Listeria-TT&#43;GEM&#43;PD1 significantly increased the survival time compared to Listeria-TT&#43;GEM alone. In summary, the results of this study suggest that our approach may benefit ovarian cancer patients.</p>
