Here we provide evidence for a specific means of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) inhibition that improves tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Targeted genetic deletion of the CI subunits Ndufs4 and Ndufs6, but not other subunits, induces an immune-dependent tumor growth attenuation in mouse melanoma models. We show that deletion of Ndufs4 induces expression of the transcription factor Nlrc5 and genes in the MHC class I antigen presentation and processing pathway. This induction of MHC-related genes is driven by an accumulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent mitochondrial acetyl-CoA downstream of CI subunit deletion. This work provides a novel functional modality by which selective CI inhibition restricts tumor growth, suggesting that specific targeting of Ndufs4, or related CI subunits, increases T-cell mediated immunity and sensitivity to ICB.\nClonal fitness decline in somatic differentiation hierarchies\nAuthors: Ahmed, I.; Dingli, D.; Huang, W.; Werner, B.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559763\nThe concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.\nA resource-based mechanistic framework for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)\nAuthors: Vibishan, B.; BV, H.; Dey, S.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558379\nCancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC. HighlightsO_LICancer growth and progression can be driven by intra-tumour interactions. C_LIO_LIProstate cancer cells compete among each other for resources like testosterone and oxygen. C_LIO_LIWe model these interactions using a modified logistic model with resource dynamics. C_LIO_LIEquilibrium behaviour can be understood through resource supply and use efficiency.

C.; Johnson, M. T.; Xin, P.; Abdelnaby, A. E.; Walter, V.; Kultun, W. A.; Yochum, G. S.; Hempel, N.; Trebak, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560521\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores large amounts of calcium (Ca2+), and the controlled release of ER Ca2+ regulates a myriad of cellular functions. Although altered ER Ca2+ homeostasis is known to induce ER stress, the mechanisms by which ER Ca2+ imbalance activate ER stress pathways are poorly understood. Stromal-interacting molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are two structurally homologous ER-resident Ca2+ sensors that synergistically regulate Ca2+ influx into the cytosol through Orai Ca2+ channels for subsequent signaling to transcription and ER Ca2+ refilling. Here, we demonstrate that reduced STIM2, but not STIM1, in colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor patient prognosis. Loss of STIM2 causes SERCA2-dependent increase in ER Ca2+, increased protein translation and transcriptional and metabolic rewiring supporting increased tumor size, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, STIM2 loss activates cMyc and the PERK/ATF4 branch of ER stress in an Orai-independent manner. Therefore, STIM2 and PERK/ATF4 could be exploited for prognosis or in targeted therapies to inhibit CRC tumor growth and metastasis. HighlightsO_LISTIM2 regulates ER Ca2+ homeostasis independently of Orai and SOCE. C_LIO_LISTIM2 downregulation in colorectal cancer cells causes enhanced ER Ca2+ and is associated with poor patient prognosis.

C_LI\nThe origin of intestinal cancer in the context of inflammation\nAuthors: Verhagen, M. P.; Joosten, R.; Schmitt, M.; Valimaki, N.; Sacchetti, A.; Rajamaki, K.; Choi, J.; Procopio, P.; Silva, S.; van der Steen, B.; van den Bosch, T. P. P.; Seinstra, D.; Doukas, M.; Augenlicht, L. H.; Aaltonen, L. A.; Fodde, R.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560432\nPaneth cells (PCs), responsible for the secretion of antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine and for niche support to Lgr5+crypt-base columnar stem cells (CBCs), have been shown to respond to inflammation by dedifferentiating into stem-like cells in order to sustain the regenerative response1,2. As such, PCs may represent the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer in the context of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we targeted Apc, Kras, and Tp53 mutations in Paneth cells by Cre-Lox technology in the mouse and modelled inflammation by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration. PC-specific loss of Apc resulted in multiple small intestinal tumors, whereas Kras or Tp53 mutations did not. Compound Apc and Kras mutations in PCs resulted in a striking increase in tumor multiplicity even in the absence of the inflammatory insult. By combining scRNAseq with lineage tracing to capture the conversion of PCs into bona fide tumor cells, we show that they progress through a \"revival stem cell\" (RSC) state characterized by high Clusterin (Clu) expression and Yap1 signaling, reminiscent of what has previously been observed upon irradiation3. Accordingly, comparison of CBC-with PC-derived murine intestinal tumors revealed differences related to Wnt signaling and inflammatory pathways which match the dichotomy of CBCs and injury-induced RSCs4 between human sporadic colon cancers and those arising in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases. Of note, a striking [~]25% of sporadic colon cancers show expression profiles similar to those of PC-initiated mouse tumors and of patients with an IBD history. The latter can be explained by the low-grade, subclinical inflammation induced by western-style dietary habits, the major colon cancer risk factor, likely to underlie the de-differentiation of secretory lineages of the colon and their acquisition of stem-like and tumor-initiating features. To validate these observations, we applied novel computational methods5-7 to predict the cell of origin of tumors by matching their genome-wide mutation spectrum with the epigenetic landscapes of colonic cell lineages. While the majority of sporadic colon cancers are predicted to originate from stem cells, in patients with an IBD history, the predominant cell of origin switches to secretory lineages such as goblet cells. Taken together, our results show that, in the context of inflammation, intestinal cancer arises through the dedifferentiation of committed secretory lineages and the activation of the revival stem cell state. The chronic nature of the inflammatory insult caused by western-style dietary habits is likely to underlie similar mechanisms in a significant proportion of sporadic colon cancers and warrants a novel stratification of the cases for improved clinical management.\nTesting Adaptive Therapy Protocols using Gemcitabine and Capecitabine on a Mouse Model of Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer\nAuthors: SEYEDI, S.; Teo, R.; Foster, L.; Saha, D.; Mina, L.; Northfelt, D.; Anderson, K. S.; Shibata, D.; Gatenby, R.; Cisneros, L.; Troan, B.; Anderson, A. R. A.; Maley, C. C.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558136\nHighly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER+ breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P \u003c 0.01) and combined drugs (P \u003c 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.\nNovel YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors identified through phenotypic screening with potent anti-tumor activity via blockade of GGTase-I / Rho-GTPase signaling\nAuthors: Graham, K.; Lienau, P.; Bader, B.; Prechtl, S.; Naujoks, J.; Lesche, R.; Weiske, J.; Kuehnlenz, J.; Brzezinka, K.; Potze, L.; Zanconato, F.; Nicke, B.; Montebaur, A.; Bone, W.; Golfier, S.; Kaulfuss, S.; Kopitz, C.; Pilari, S.; Steuber, H.; Hayat, S.; Kamburov, A.; Steffen, A.; Schlicker, A.; Buchgraber, P.; Braeuer, N.; Font, N.

A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) complex, as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The novel small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo. SIGNIFICANCEYAP1/TAZ have been shown to be aberrantly activated oncogenes in several human solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis and provision of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, making YAP1/TAZ targets for novel cancer therapies. Yet, the development of effective inhibitors of these potent oncogenes has been challenging. In this work, we break new ground in this direction through the identification of novel inhibitors of YAP1/TAZ activity.

Z.; Ong, S.-E.; Baker, D.; Maly, D. J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560617\nRecently developed covalent inhibitors for RasG12C provide the first pharmacological tools to target mutant Ras-driven cancers. However, the rapid development of resistance to current clinical Ras G12C inhibitors is common. Presumably, a subpopulation of RasG12C-expressing cells adapt their signaling to evade these inhibitors and the mechanisms for this phenomenon are unclear due to the lack of tools that can measure signaling with single-cell resolution. Here, we utilized recently developed Ras sensors to profile the environment of active Ras and to measure the activity of endogenous Ras in order to pair structure (Ras signalosome) to function (Ras activity), respectively, at a single-cell level. With this approach, we identified a subpopulation of KRasG12C cells treated with RasG12C-GDP inhibitors underwent oncogenic signaling and metabolic changes driven by WT Ras at the golgi and mutant Ras at the mitochondria, respectively. Our Ras sensors identified Major Vault Protein (MVP) as a mediator of Ras activation at both compartments by scaffolding Ras signaling pathway components and metabolite channels. We found that recently developed RasG12C-GTP inhibitors also led to MVP-mediated WT Ras signaling at the golgi, demonstrating that this a general mechanism RasG12C inhibitor resistance. Overall, single-cell analysis of structure-function relationships enabled the discovery of a RasG12C inhibitor-resistant subpopulation driven by MVP, providing insight into the complex and heterogenous rewiring occurring during drug resistance in cancer.\nTargeting Acute Myeloid Leukemia Stem Cells Through Perturbation of Mitochondrial Calcium\nAuthors: Sheth, A. I.; Engel, K.; Tolison, H.; Althoff, M. J.; Amaya, M. L.; Krug, A.; Young, T.; Pei, S.; Patel, S. B.; Minhajuddin, M.; Winters, A.; Miller, R.; Shelton, I.; St-Germain, J.; Ling, T.; Jones, C.; Raught, B.; Gillen, A. E.; Ransom, M. R.; Staggs, S.; Smith, C.; Pollyea, D. A.; Stevens, B. M.; Jordan, C. T.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560330\nWe previously reported that acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are uniquely reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for survival. Moreover, maintenance of OXPHOS is dependent on BCL2, creating a therapeutic opportunity to target LSCs using the BCL2 inhibitor drug venetoclax. While venetoclax-based regimens have indeed shown promising clinical activity, the emergence of drug resistance is prevalent. Thus, in the present study, we investigated how mitochondrial properties may influence mechanisms that dictate venetoclax responsiveness. Our data show that utilization of mitochondrial calcium is fundamentally different between drug responsive and non-responsive LSCs. By comparison, venetoclax-resistant LSCs demonstrate a more active metabolic (i.e., OXPHOS) status with relatively high steady-state levels of calcium. Consequently, we tested genetic and pharmacological approaches to target the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. We demonstrate that inhibition of calcium uptake sharply reduces OXPHOS and leads to eradication of venetoclax-resistant LSCs. These findings demonstrate a central role for calcium signaling in the biology of LSCs and provide a therapeutic avenue for clinical management of venetoclax resistance. SignificanceWe identify increased utilization of mitochondrial calcium as distinct metabolic requirement of venetoclax-resistant LSCs and demonstrate the potential of targeting mitochondrial calcium uptake as a therapeutic strategy.\nGM-CSF and IL-3 expression increases immune engraftment and tumor infiltration in a humanized patient-derived xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma\nAuthors: Weinfurtner, K.; Tischfield, D.; Crainic, J.; Li, W.; Kaplan, D. E.; Gade, T. P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561117\nIntroduction: Immunotherapy has shown promising results in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and relevant model systems are greatly needed to inform treatment paradigms. Transplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hematopoietic cells allows for the development of humanized patient derived xenografts (HIS PDXs); however, these models have limited development of myeloid lineages. We aimed to determine the impact of human GM-CSF and IL-3 expression on tumor immune cell infiltration and tumor growth in a HIS PDX model of HCC. Materials and Methods: HIS HCC PDXs were generated using NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R{gamma}null) and NOG-EXL (huGM-CSF/huIL-3 NOG) mice conditioned with 30mg/kg Busulfan and, 24 hours later, injected with 400,000 CD34+ cells isolated from human fetal livers. HCC tumor tissue from an established PDX line in Matrigel was then implanted subcutaneously (SQ). Immune engraftment was monitored by flow cytometry. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2cm and tumor, blood, liver, and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice demonstrated earlier and persistently increased huCD45+ peripheral blood immune cells compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with 12.1% vs 1.7% at tumor implantation (p\u003c0.0001) and 82.1% vs 43.8% at steady state (p\u003c0.0001). All major immune cell types were represented in both groups. There was no difference in tumor growth between HIS NOG HCC, HIS NOG-EXL HCC, and control NOG HCC tumors by latency (48.4, 45.5, and 50.5 days, respectively, p=0.63) or Gompertzian growth rates (0.32, 0.31, 0.40, respectively, p=0.68). At necropsy, HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice had increased huCD45+ immune cells in tumor (27.2% vs 8.6%, p=0.03) compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with increased CD4+ regulatory T cells (21.0% vs 11.1%, p=0.04), CD4+ T cell PD-1 expression (77.9% vs 49.4%, p=0.03), and M2 macrophage phenotype (36.1% vs 17.6%, p=0.04). Conclusions: HIS HCC PDX models demonstrate robust immune infiltration in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and SQ HCC tumor, especially in mice expressing human GM-CSF and IL-3. Expression of these human cytokines lead to increased tumor infiltrating immune cells with a higher proportion of regulatory immune cells, suggesting NOG-EXL mice may be a more appropriate model for preclinical trials with immunotherapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Targeting of specific metabolic pathways in tumor cells has the potential to sensitize them to immune-mediated attack. Here we provide evidence for a specific means of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) inhibition that improves tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Targeted genetic deletion of the CI subunits Ndufs4 and Ndufs6, but not other subunits, induces an immune-dependent tumor growth attenuation in mouse melanoma models. We show that deletion of Ndufs4 induces expression of the transcription factor Nlrc5 and genes in the MHC class I antigen presentation and processing pathway. This induction of MHC-related genes is driven by an accumulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent mitochondrial acetyl-CoA downstream of CI subunit deletion. This work provides a novel functional modality by which selective CI inhibition restricts tumor growth, suggesting that specific targeting of Ndufs4, or related CI subunits, increases T-cell mediated immunity and sensitivity to ICB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores large amounts of calcium (Ca2&#43;), and the controlled release of ER Ca2&#43; regulates a myriad of cellular functions. Although altered ER Ca2&#43; homeostasis is known to induce ER stress, the mechanisms by which ER Ca2&#43; imbalance activate ER stress pathways are poorly understood. Stromal-interacting molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are two structurally homologous ER-resident Ca2&#43; sensors that synergistically regulate Ca2&#43; influx into the cytosol through Orai Ca2&#43; channels for subsequent signaling to transcription and ER Ca2&#43; refilling. Here, we demonstrate that reduced STIM2, but not STIM1, in colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor patient prognosis. Loss of STIM2 causes SERCA2-dependent increase in ER Ca2&#43;, increased protein translation and transcriptional and metabolic rewiring supporting increased tumor size, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, STIM2 loss activates cMyc and the PERK/ATF4 branch of ER stress in an Orai-independent manner. Therefore, STIM2 and PERK/ATF4 could be exploited for prognosis or in targeted therapies to inhibit CRC tumor growth and metastasis.

        <p class="abstract">Paneth cells (PCs), responsible for the secretion of antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine and for niche support to Lgr5&#43;crypt-base columnar stem cells (CBCs), have been shown to respond to inflammation by dedifferentiating into stem-like cells in order to sustain the regenerative response1,2. As such, PCs may represent the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer in the context of inflammation.

To test this hypothesis, we targeted Apc, Kras, and Tp53 mutations in Paneth cells by Cre-Lox technology in the mouse and modelled inflammation by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration. PC-specific loss of Apc resulted in multiple small intestinal tumors, whereas Kras or Tp53 mutations did not. Compound Apc and Kras mutations in PCs resulted in a striking increase in tumor multiplicity even in the absence of the inflammatory insult. By combining scRNAseq with lineage tracing to capture the conversion of PCs into bona fide tumor cells, we show that they progress through a &#34;revival stem cell&#34; (RSC) state characterized by high Clusterin (Clu) expression and Yap1 signaling, reminiscent of what has previously been observed upon irradiation3. Accordingly, comparison of CBC-with PC-derived murine intestinal tumors revealed differences related to Wnt signaling and inflammatory pathways which match the dichotomy of CBCs and injury-induced RSCs4 between human sporadic colon cancers and those arising in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases. Of note, a striking [~]25% of sporadic colon cancers show expression profiles similar to those of PC-initiated mouse tumors and of patients with an IBD history. The latter can be explained by the low-grade, subclinical inflammation induced by western-style dietary habits, the major colon cancer risk factor, likely to underlie the de-differentiation of secretory lineages of the colon and their acquisition of stem-like and tumor-initiating features. To validate these observations, we applied novel computational methods5-7 to predict the cell of origin of tumors by matching their genome-wide mutation spectrum with the epigenetic landscapes of colonic cell lineages. While the majority of sporadic colon cancers are predicted to originate from stem cells, in patients with an IBD history, the predominant cell of origin switches to secretory lineages such as goblet cells.

Taken together, our results show that, in the context of inflammation, intestinal cancer arises through the dedifferentiation of committed secretory lineages and the activation of the revival stem cell state. The chronic nature of the inflammatory insult caused by western-style dietary habits is likely to underlie similar mechanisms in a significant proportion of sporadic colon cancers and warrants a novel stratification of the cases for improved clinical management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER&#43; breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P &lt; 0.01) and combined drugs (P &lt; 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study describes the identification and target deconvolution of novel small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic YAP1/TAZ activity with potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) complex, as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The novel small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo.

SIGNIFICANCEYAP1/TAZ have been shown to be aberrantly activated oncogenes in several human solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis and provision of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, making YAP1/TAZ targets for novel cancer therapies. Yet, the development of effective inhibitors of these potent oncogenes has been challenging. In this work, we break new ground in this direction through the identification of novel inhibitors of YAP1/TAZ activity.

        <p class="abstract">Recently developed covalent inhibitors for RasG12C provide the first pharmacological tools to target mutant Ras-driven cancers. However, the rapid development of resistance to current clinical Ras G12C inhibitors is common. Presumably, a subpopulation of RasG12C-expressing cells adapt their signaling to evade these inhibitors and the mechanisms for this phenomenon are unclear due to the lack of tools that can measure signaling with single-cell resolution. Here, we utilized recently developed Ras sensors to profile the environment of active Ras and to measure the activity of endogenous Ras in order to pair structure (Ras signalosome) to function (Ras activity), respectively, at a single-cell level. With this approach, we identified a subpopulation of KRasG12C cells treated with RasG12C-GDP inhibitors underwent oncogenic signaling and metabolic changes driven by WT Ras at the golgi and mutant Ras at the mitochondria, respectively. Our Ras sensors identified Major Vault Protein (MVP) as a mediator of Ras activation at both compartments by scaffolding Ras signaling pathway components and metabolite channels. We found that recently developed RasG12C-GTP inhibitors also led to MVP-mediated WT Ras signaling at the golgi, demonstrating that this a general mechanism RasG12C inhibitor resistance. Overall, single-cell analysis of structure-function relationships enabled the discovery of a RasG12C inhibitor-resistant subpopulation driven by MVP, providing insight into the complex and heterogenous rewiring occurring during drug resistance in cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We previously reported that acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are uniquely reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for survival. Moreover, maintenance of OXPHOS is dependent on BCL2, creating a therapeutic opportunity to target LSCs using the BCL2 inhibitor drug venetoclax. While venetoclax-based regimens have indeed shown promising clinical activity, the emergence of drug resistance is prevalent. Thus, in the present study, we investigated how mitochondrial properties may influence mechanisms that dictate venetoclax responsiveness. Our data show that utilization of mitochondrial calcium is fundamentally different between drug responsive and non-responsive LSCs. By comparison, venetoclax-resistant LSCs demonstrate a more active metabolic (i.e., OXPHOS) status with relatively high steady-state levels of calcium. Consequently, we tested genetic and pharmacological approaches to target the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. We demonstrate that inhibition of calcium uptake sharply reduces OXPHOS and leads to eradication of venetoclax-resistant LSCs. These findings demonstrate a central role for calcium signaling in the biology of LSCs and provide a therapeutic avenue for clinical management of venetoclax resistance.

SignificanceWe identify increased utilization of mitochondrial calcium as distinct metabolic requirement of venetoclax-resistant LSCs and demonstrate the potential of targeting mitochondrial calcium uptake as a therapeutic strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Immunotherapy has shown promising results in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and relevant model systems are greatly needed to inform treatment paradigms. Transplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hematopoietic cells allows for the development of humanized patient derived xenografts (HIS PDXs); however, these models have limited development of myeloid lineages. We aimed to determine the impact of human GM-CSF and IL-3 expression on tumor immune cell infiltration and tumor growth in a HIS PDX model of HCC. Materials and Methods: HIS HCC PDXs were generated using NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R{gamma}null) and NOG-EXL (huGM-CSF/huIL-3 NOG) mice conditioned with 30mg/kg Busulfan and, 24 hours later, injected with 400,000 CD34&#43; cells isolated from human fetal livers. HCC tumor tissue from an established PDX line in Matrigel was then implanted subcutaneously (SQ). Immune engraftment was monitored by flow cytometry. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2cm and tumor, blood, liver, and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice demonstrated earlier and persistently increased huCD45&#43; peripheral blood immune cells compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with 12.1% vs 1.7% at tumor implantation (p&lt;0.0001) and 82.1% vs 43.8% at steady state (p&lt;0.0001). All major immune cell types were represented in both groups. There was no difference in tumor growth between HIS NOG HCC, HIS NOG-EXL HCC, and control NOG HCC tumors by latency (48.4, 45.5, and 50.5 days, respectively, p=0.63) or Gompertzian growth rates (0.32, 0.31, 0.40, respectively, p=0.68). At necropsy, HIS NOG-EXL HCC mice had increased huCD45&#43; immune cells in tumor (27.2% vs 8.6%, p=0.03) compared to HIS NOG HCC mice with increased CD4&#43; regulatory T cells (21.0% vs 11.1%, p=0.04), CD4&#43; T cell PD-1 expression (77.9% vs 49.4%, p=0.03), and M2 macrophage phenotype (36.1% vs 17.6%, p=0.04). Conclusions: HIS HCC PDX models demonstrate robust immune infiltration in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and SQ HCC tumor, especially in mice expressing human GM-CSF and IL-3. Expression of these human cytokines lead to increased tumor infiltrating immune cells with a higher proportion of regulatory immune cells, suggesting NOG-EXL mice may be a more appropriate model for preclinical trials with immunotherapy.</p>
