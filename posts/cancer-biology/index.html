J.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555396\nOncogenic KRAS mutations are well-described functionally and are known to drive tumorigenesis. Recent reports describe a significant prevalence of KRAS allelic imbalances or gene dosage changes in human cancers, including loss of the wild-type allele in KRAS mutant cancers. However, there is still much debate over the function of wild-type KRAS in tumour initiation, progression and therapeutic response. We have developed a genetically engineered mouse model which allows deletion of the wild-type copy of Kras in the context of an intact oncogenic Kras in colorectal cancer. We observe that in the presence of oncogenic Kras, wild-type Kras acts to restrain tumour growth. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras exacerbates oncogenic KRAS signalling through MAPK and thus drives tumour initiation. Absence of wild-type Kras potentiates the oncogenic effect of KRASG12D, while presence of wild-type Kras is associated with resistance to inhibition of MEK1/2 in KRASG12D driven tumours. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras in oncogenic KRAS-driven aggressive tumours significantly alters tumour progression, metastasis while impacting tumour immune cell infiltration. This study demonstrates a suppressive role for wild-type Kras during colon tumour initiation and highlights the critical impact of wild-type Kras upon therapeutic response to MAPK and tumour progression in Kras mutant cancers.\nIntegration of Multiple Spatial-Omics Modalities Reveals Unique Insights into Molecular Heterogeneity of Prostate Cancer\nAuthors: Zhang, W.; Spotbeen, X.; Vanuytven, S.; Kint, S.; Sarretto, T.; Socciarelli, F.; Vandereyken, K.; Dehairs, J.; Idkowiak, J.; Wouters, D.; Alvira Larizgoitia, J.

V.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555056\nRecent advances in spatial omics methods are revolutionising biomedical research by enabling detailed molecular analyses of cells and their interactions in their native state. As most technologies capture only a specific type of molecules, there is an unmet need to enable integration of multiple spatial-omics datasets. This, however, presents several challenges as these analyses typically operate on separate tissue sections at disparate spatial resolutions. Here, we established a spatial multi-omics integration pipeline enabling co-registration and granularity matching, and applied it to integrate spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, single nucleus RNA-seq and histomorphological information from human prostate cancer patient samples. This approach revealed unique correlations between lipids and gene expression profiles that are linked to distinct cell populations and histopathological disease states and uncovered molecularly different subregions not discernible by morphology alone. By its ability to correlate datasets that span across the biomolecular and spatial scale, the application of this novel spatial multi-omics integration pipeline provides unprecedented insight into the intricate interplay between different classes of molecules in a tissue context. In addition, it has unique hypothesis-generating potential, and holds promise for applications in molecular pathology, biomarker and target discovery and other tissue-based research fields.\nKras loss of heterozygosity promotes MAPK dependent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and induces therapeutic sensitivity\nAuthors: Fey, S. K.; Najumudeen, A. K.; Ford, C. A.; Gilroy, K.; Upstill-Goddard, R.; Clark, W.; Nixon, C.; Chang, D. K.; Barry, S. T.; Morton, J. P.; Campbell, A. D.; Sansom, O. J.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.552598\nPancreatic cancer is characterised by the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in KRAS. Previous studies have reported that altered Kras gene dosage drives progression and metastatic incidence in pancreatic cancer. While the role of oncogenic KRAS mutation is well characterised, the relevance of the partnering wild-type KRAS allele in pancreatic cancer is less well understood and controversial. Using in vivo mouse modelling of pancreatic cancer, we demonstrate that wild-type Kras restrains the oncogenic impact of mutant Kras, and drastically impacts both Kras-mediated tumourigenesis and therapeutic response. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras increases oncogenic Kras signalling through the downstream MAPK effector pathway, driving pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) initiation. In addition, in the KPC mouse model, a more aggressive model of pancreatic cancer, loss of wild-type KRAS leads to accelerated initiation but delayed tumour progression. These tumours had altered stroma, downregulated Myc levels and an enrichment for immunogenic gene signatures. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras sensitises Kras mutant tumours to MEK1/2 inhibition though tumours eventually become resistant and then rapidly progress. This study demonstrates the repressive role of wild-type Kras during pancreatic tumourigenesis and highlights the critical impact of the presence of wild-type KRAS on tumourigenesis and therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer.\nAn autochthonous model of lung cancer in the Naked Mole-Rat (Heterocephalus glaber)\nAuthors: Kissil, J.; Shepard, A.; Troutman, S.; Hoxha, S.; Lester, D.; Khaled, W.; Smith, E.

Here, we provide evidence that the NMR presents as a novel model of tumor initiation. We developed an endogenous lung cancer model in NMRs, driven by an oncogenic Eml4-Alk fusion protein introduced through CRISPR- mediated genome editing. While this is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in mice, the development of progressive disease in NMRs required the additional loss of key tumor suppressors. Our results show that tumor initiation in NMRs more closely recapitulates that of human tumors. This suggests that the proposed \"resistance\" of NMRs to cancer development may stem from tumor initiation events that are likely to be comparable to the mechanisms in human cells. One-Sentence SummaryTumor development in the cancer-resistant naked mole-rat more accurately represents the tumor initiation process in humans.\nEvolvability of cancer-associated genes under APOBEC3A/B selection\nAuthors: Song, J.-H.; Davalos, L.; MacCarthy, T.; Damaghi, M.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.554991\nEvolvability is an emergent hallmark of cancer that depends on intra-tumor heterogeneity and, ultimately, genetic variation. Mutations generated by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases can contribute to genetic variation and the consequences of APOBEC activation differ depending on the stage of cancer, with the most significant impact observed during the early stages. However, how APOBEC activity shapes evolutionary patterns of genes in the host genome and differential impacts on cancer-associated and non-cancer genes remain unclear. Analyzing over 40,000 human protein-coding transcripts, we identified distinct distribution patterns of APOBEC3A/B TC motifs between cancer-related genes and controls, suggesting unique associations with cancer. Studying a bat species with many more APOBEC3 genes, we found diverse motif patterns in orthologs of cancer genes compared to controls, similar to humans and suggesting APOBEC evolution to reduce impacts on the genome rather than the converse. Simulations confirmed that APOBEC-induced heterogeneity enhances cancer evolution, shaping clonal dynamics through bimodal introduction of mutations in certain classes of genes. Our results suggest that a major consequence of the bimodal distribution of APOBEC affects greater cancer heterogeneity. HighlightsO_LIUsing a measure of the extent which genes are affected by APOBEC activity, we found that many genes are maximally robust in the human genome. Interestingly, the distribution in the genome of a bat that has many APOBEC genes was similar. C_LIO_LIIn contrast, when analyzing the subset of cancer-associated genes the distribution is bimodal with many genes appearing to susceptible to APOBEC activity. C_LIO_LIAnalysis of orthologs of human genes and other species showed a wide range in the extent to which APOBEC affects genes having the same function. C_LIO_LIThe bimodal distribution of susceptibility to APOBEC drives greater heterogeneity in simulated clonal evolution of cancer.

L.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555214\nResistance of cancers to treatments, such as chemotherapy, largely arise due to cell mutations. These mutations allow cells to resist apoptosis and inevitably lead to recurrence and often progression to more aggressive cancer forms. Sustained-low dose therapies are being considered as an alternative over maximum tolerated dose treatments, whereby a smaller drug dosage is given over a longer period of time. However, understanding the impact that the presence of treatment-resistant clones may have on these new treatment modalities is crucial to validating them as a therapeutic avenue. In this study, a Moran process is used to capture stochastic mutations arising in cancer cells, inferring treatment resistance. The model is used to predict the probability of cancer recurrence given varying treatment modalities. The simulations predict that sustained-low dose therapies would be virtually ineffective for a cancer with a non-negligible probability of developing a sub-clone with resistance tendencies. Furthermore, calibrating the model to in vivo measurements for breast cancer treatment with Herceptin, the model suggests that standard treatment regimens are ineffective in this mouse model. Using a simple Moran model, it is possible to explore the likelihood of treatment success given a non-negligible probability of treatment resistant mutations and suggest more robust therapeutic schedules.\nMutational order and epistasis determine the consequences of FBXW7 mutations during colorectal cancer evolution\nAuthors: Chan, D. K. H.; Mandal, A.; Collins, S. D.; Zhou, Y.; Owen, R.; Bundred, J.; Househam, J.; Graham, T. A.; Lu, X.; Buczacki, S. J. A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554836\nSomatic driver mutations, in genes such as FBXW7, have been discovered in phenotypically normal colonic tissue, however their role in cancer initiation remains elusive. Here, using patient-derived human colon organoids as models of early tumour evolution we investigate the consequences of FBXW7 mutations in normal and gene-edited organoids. We observed that FBXW7 mutations exert an epistatic effect where the transcriptional consequences of the mutation are dependent on the background mutational makeup of the cell. Specifically, we found the timing of acquiring an FBXW7 mutation relative to APC mutation, led to profound differences. When FBXW7 was mutated before APC, repression of the APC transcriptional response and maintenance of near-normal cell state was seen. However, when APC was mutated before FBXW7, cells acquired classic cancer-stem cell features. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that FBXW7 mutations in normal tissue also function by subtly reordering stem cell hierarchies and priming a fetal/regenerative phenotype through upregulation of YAP/TAZ signaling. Further analysis using transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing found this cellular plasticity was driven by changes in the chromatin accessibility of 36 transcriptional start site regions associated with TEAD1/TEAD2 motifs, which in turn upregulated YAP. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of FBXW7 mutations in preventing the initiation of colorectal cancer, and provide exemplar evidence for the importance of epistasis and mutational order in cancer biology.\nThe translation of a short open reading frame product within the human TUBA1B gene regulates cancer cell proliferation by importin-β\nAuthors: Tao, Y.; Bai, X.; Zhou, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Yang, L.; Zhang, S.; Yan, S.; Huang, X.; Schneider, E.; Zampetaki, A.; Margariti, A.; Giacca, M.; Arnold, J. N.; Zeng, L.; Cai, T.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554759\nUnderstanding cancer biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progress are crucial for improving cancer treatment strategies. This study revealed a short open reading frame product (sORF1) alternatively translated from the human -tubulin gene (TUBA1B), which has the completely different amino acids sequence from its main ORF product, -tubulin 1B chain. sORF1 is highly expressed in cancer cell lines and positive sORF1 cells are found in gastric carcinoma. sORF1 interacts with more than one hundred proteins including importin {beta}. It also acts as a modifier like small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) by covalent binding. Knockdown of sORF1 in cancer cells decreases cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Further study reveals that the loss of sORF1-importin {beta} connections inhibits importin {beta} guided {beta}-catenin nucleus translocation, thus downregulates Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that gene TUBA1B is a polycistronic gene, able to translate two distinct proteins and the TUBA1B-sORF1 functions as a key tumorigenesis regulator. TUBA1B-sORF1 possesses great potential to be developed as therapeutic target and diagnosis biomarker for cancer.\nIntegration of Mass Cytometry and Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Spatially Resolved Single Cell Metabolic Profiling\nAuthors: Nunes, J.

We combined mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics and imaging mass cytometry-based immunophenotyping on the same single tissue section to reveal metabolic heterogeneity within tissues and its association with specific cell populations like cancer cells or immune cells. This approach has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of tissue-level interplay between metabolic processes and their cellular components.\nNovel YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors identified through phenotypic screening with potent anti-tumor activity via blockade of GGTase-I / Rho-GTPase signaling\nAuthors: Graham, K.; Lienau, P.; Bader, B.; Prechtl, S.; Naujoks, J.; Lesche, R.; Kuehnlenz, J.; Brzezinka, K.; Potze, L.; Zanconato, F.; Nicke, B.; Montebaur, A.; Bone, W.; Golfier, S.; Kaulfuss, S.; Kopitz, C.; Pilari, S.; Steuber, H.; Hayat, S.; Kamburov, A.; Steffen, A.; Schlicker, A.; Buchgraber, P.; Braeuer, N.; Font, N.

A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) complex, as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The novel small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Oncogenic KRAS mutations are well-described functionally and are known to drive tumorigenesis. Recent reports describe a significant prevalence of KRAS allelic imbalances or gene dosage changes in human cancers, including loss of the wild-type allele in KRAS mutant cancers. However, there is still much debate over the function of wild-type KRAS in tumour initiation, progression and therapeutic response. We have developed a genetically engineered mouse model which allows deletion of the wild-type copy of Kras in the context of an intact oncogenic Kras in colorectal cancer. We observe that in the presence of oncogenic Kras, wild-type Kras acts to restrain tumour growth. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras exacerbates oncogenic KRAS signalling through MAPK and thus drives tumour initiation. Absence of wild-type Kras potentiates the oncogenic effect of KRASG12D, while presence of wild-type Kras is associated with resistance to inhibition of MEK1/2 in KRASG12D driven tumours. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras in oncogenic KRAS-driven aggressive tumours significantly alters tumour progression, metastasis while impacting tumour immune cell infiltration. This study demonstrates a suppressive role for wild-type Kras during colon tumour initiation and highlights the critical impact of wild-type Kras upon therapeutic response to MAPK and tumour progression in Kras mutant cancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in spatial omics methods are revolutionising biomedical research by enabling detailed molecular analyses of cells and their interactions in their native state. As most technologies capture only a specific type of molecules, there is an unmet need to enable integration of multiple spatial-omics datasets. This, however, presents several challenges as these analyses typically operate on separate tissue sections at disparate spatial resolutions. Here, we established a spatial multi-omics integration pipeline enabling co-registration and granularity matching, and applied it to integrate spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, single nucleus RNA-seq and histomorphological information from human prostate cancer patient samples. This approach revealed unique correlations between lipids and gene expression profiles that are linked to distinct cell populations and histopathological disease states and uncovered molecularly different subregions not discernible by morphology alone. By its ability to correlate datasets that span across the biomolecular and spatial scale, the application of this novel spatial multi-omics integration pipeline provides unprecedented insight into the intricate interplay between different classes of molecules in a tissue context. In addition, it has unique hypothesis-generating potential, and holds promise for applications in molecular pathology, biomarker and target discovery and other tissue-based research fields.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic cancer is characterised by the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in KRAS. Previous studies have reported that altered Kras gene dosage drives progression and metastatic incidence in pancreatic cancer. While the role of oncogenic KRAS mutation is well characterised, the relevance of the partnering wild-type KRAS allele in pancreatic cancer is less well understood and controversial. Using in vivo mouse modelling of pancreatic cancer, we demonstrate that wild-type Kras restrains the oncogenic impact of mutant Kras, and drastically impacts both Kras-mediated tumourigenesis and therapeutic response. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras increases oncogenic Kras signalling through the downstream MAPK effector pathway, driving pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) initiation. In addition, in the KPC mouse model, a more aggressive model of pancreatic cancer, loss of wild-type KRAS leads to accelerated initiation but delayed tumour progression. These tumours had altered stroma, downregulated Myc levels and an enrichment for immunogenic gene signatures. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras sensitises Kras mutant tumours to MEK1/2 inhibition though tumours eventually become resistant and then rapidly progress. This study demonstrates the repressive role of wild-type Kras during pancreatic tumourigenesis and highlights the critical impact of the presence of wild-type KRAS on tumourigenesis and therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies on cancer resistance in the naked mole-rat (NMR) have generally failed to interrogate possible resistance mechanisms in a physiological context. Here, we provide evidence that the NMR presents as a novel model of tumor initiation. We developed an endogenous lung cancer model in NMRs, driven by an oncogenic Eml4-Alk fusion protein introduced through CRISPR- mediated genome editing. While this is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in mice, the development of progressive disease in NMRs required the additional loss of key tumor suppressors. Our results show that tumor initiation in NMRs more closely recapitulates that of human tumors. This suggests that the proposed &#34;resistance&#34; of NMRs to cancer development may stem from tumor initiation events that are likely to be comparable to the mechanisms in human cells.

        <p class="abstract">Evolvability is an emergent hallmark of cancer that depends on intra-tumor heterogeneity and, ultimately, genetic variation. Mutations generated by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases can contribute to genetic variation and the consequences of APOBEC activation differ depending on the stage of cancer, with the most significant impact observed during the early stages. However, how APOBEC activity shapes evolutionary patterns of genes in the host genome and differential impacts on cancer-associated and non-cancer genes remain unclear. Analyzing over 40,000 human protein-coding transcripts, we identified distinct distribution patterns of APOBEC3A/B TC motifs between cancer-related genes and controls, suggesting unique associations with cancer. Studying a bat species with many more APOBEC3 genes, we found diverse motif patterns in orthologs of cancer genes compared to controls, similar to humans and suggesting APOBEC evolution to reduce impacts on the genome rather than the converse. Simulations confirmed that APOBEC-induced heterogeneity enhances cancer evolution, shaping clonal dynamics through bimodal introduction of mutations in certain classes of genes. Our results suggest that a major consequence of the bimodal distribution of APOBEC affects greater cancer heterogeneity.

HighlightsO_LIUsing a measure of the extent which genes are affected by APOBEC activity, we found that many genes are maximally robust in the human genome. Interestingly, the distribution in the genome of a bat that has many APOBEC genes was similar.
C_LIO_LIIn contrast, when analyzing the subset of cancer-associated genes the distribution is bimodal with many genes appearing to susceptible to APOBEC activity.
C_LIO_LIAnalysis of orthologs of human genes and other species showed a wide range in the extent to which APOBEC affects genes having the same function.
C_LIO_LIThe bimodal distribution of susceptibility to APOBEC drives greater heterogeneity in simulated clonal evolution of cancer.

        <p class="abstract">Resistance of cancers to treatments, such as chemotherapy, largely arise due to cell mutations. These mutations allow cells to resist apoptosis and inevitably lead to recurrence and often progression to more aggressive cancer forms. Sustained-low dose therapies are being considered as an alternative over maximum tolerated dose treatments, whereby a smaller drug dosage is given over a longer period of time. However, understanding the impact that the presence of treatment-resistant clones may have on these new treatment modalities is crucial to validating them as a therapeutic avenue. In this study, a Moran process is used to capture stochastic mutations arising in cancer cells, inferring treatment resistance. The model is used to predict the probability of cancer recurrence given varying treatment modalities. The simulations predict that sustained-low dose therapies would be virtually ineffective for a cancer with a non-negligible probability of developing a sub-clone with resistance tendencies. Furthermore, calibrating the model to in vivo measurements for breast cancer treatment with Herceptin, the model suggests that standard treatment regimens are ineffective in this mouse model. Using a simple Moran model, it is possible to explore the likelihood of treatment success given a non-negligible probability of treatment resistant mutations and suggest more robust therapeutic schedules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Somatic driver mutations, in genes such as FBXW7, have been discovered in phenotypically normal colonic tissue, however their role in cancer initiation remains elusive. Here, using patient-derived human colon organoids as models of early tumour evolution we investigate the consequences of FBXW7 mutations in normal and gene-edited organoids. We observed that FBXW7 mutations exert an epistatic effect where the transcriptional consequences of the mutation are dependent on the background mutational makeup of the cell. Specifically, we found the timing of acquiring an FBXW7 mutation relative to APC mutation, led to profound differences. When FBXW7 was mutated before APC, repression of the APC transcriptional response and maintenance of near-normal cell state was seen. However, when APC was mutated before FBXW7, cells acquired classic cancer-stem cell features. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that FBXW7 mutations in normal tissue also function by subtly reordering stem cell hierarchies and priming a fetal/regenerative phenotype through upregulation of YAP/TAZ signaling. Further analysis using transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing found this cellular plasticity was driven by changes in the chromatin accessibility of 36 transcriptional start site regions associated with TEAD1/TEAD2 motifs, which in turn upregulated YAP. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of FBXW7 mutations in preventing the initiation of colorectal cancer, and provide exemplar evidence for the importance of epistasis and mutational order in cancer biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding cancer biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progress are crucial for improving cancer treatment strategies. This study revealed a short open reading frame product (sORF1) alternatively translated from the human -tubulin gene (TUBA1B), which has the completely different amino acids sequence from its main ORF product, -tubulin 1B chain. sORF1 is highly expressed in cancer cell lines and positive sORF1 cells are found in gastric carcinoma. sORF1 interacts with more than one hundred proteins including importin {beta}. It also acts as a modifier like small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) by covalent binding. Knockdown of sORF1 in cancer cells decreases cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Further study reveals that the loss of sORF1-importin {beta} connections inhibits importin {beta} guided {beta}-catenin nucleus translocation, thus downregulates Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that gene TUBA1B is a polycistronic gene, able to translate two distinct proteins and the TUBA1B-sORF1 functions as a key tumorigenesis regulator. TUBA1B-sORF1 possesses great potential to be developed as therapeutic target and diagnosis biomarker for cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Integration of spatial omics technologies can provide important insights into the biology of tissues. We combined mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics and imaging mass cytometry-based immunophenotyping on the same single tissue section to reveal metabolic heterogeneity within tissues and its association with specific cell populations like cancer cells or immune cells. This approach has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of tissue-level interplay between metabolic processes and their cellular components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study describes the identification and target deconvolution of novel small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic YAP1/TAZ activity with potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) complex, as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The novel small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo.</p>
