However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.\nSelective advantage of mutant stem cells in clonal hematopoiesis occurs by attenuating the deleterious effects of inflammation and aging\nAuthors: Jakobsen, N. A.; Turkalj, S.; Zeng, A. G. X.; Stoilova, B.; Metzner, M.; Nagree, M. S.; Shah, S.; Moore, R.; Usukhbayar, B.; Salazar, M. A.; Gafencu, G.-A.; Kennedy, A.; Newman, S.; Kendrick, B. J. L.; Taylor, A. H.; Afinowi-Luitz, R.; Gundle, R.; Watkins, B.; Wheway, K.; Beazley, D.; Murison, A.; Aguilar-Navarro, A. G.; Flores-Figueroa, E.; Dakin, S. G.; Carr, A. J.; Nerlov, C.; Dick, J. E.; Xie, S. Z.; Vyas, P.\nScore: 26.5, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557322\nClonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises when hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) acquire mutations in genes, including DNMT3A and TET2, conferring a competitive advantage through a mechanism that remains unclear. To gain insight into how CH mutations enable gradual clonal expansion, we used single-cell multi-omics with high-fidelity genotyping on CH bone marrow samples. Most of the selective advantage of mutant cells occurs within HSCs. DNMT3A and TET2-mutant clones expand further in early progenitors, while TET2 mutations accelerate myeloid maturation in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, both mutant and non-mutant HSCs from CH samples are enriched for inflammatory and aging transcriptomic signatures, compared to HSC from non-CH samples, revealing a non-cell autonomous mechanism. However, DNMT3A and TET2-mutant HSCs have an attenuated inflammatory response relative to wild-type HSCs within the same sample. Our data support a model whereby CH clones are gradually selected because they are more resistant to the deleterious impact of inflammation and aging.\nMTOR as a selectable genomic harbor for CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cell therapy\nAuthors: Levesque, S.; Carleton, G.; Duque, V.; Goupil, C.; Fiset, J.-P.; Villeneuve, S.; Normandeau, E.; Morin, G.; Dumont, N.; Laganiere, J.; Boyle, B.; Lum, J. J.; Doyon, Y.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557485\nChimeric antigen receptors (CARs) reprogram T cells to recognize and target cancer cells. Despite remarkable responses observed with CAR-T cell therapy in patients with hematological malignancies, CAR-T cell engineering still relies mostly on randomly integrating vectors, limiting the possibilities of fine-tuning T cell function. Here, we designed a CRISPR-based marker-free selection strategy to simultaneously target a therapeutic transgene and a gain-of-function mutation to the MTOR locus to enrich cells resistant to rapamycin, a clinically used immunosuppressant. We readily engineered rapamycin-resistant (RapaR) CAR-T cells by targeting CAR expression cassettes to the MTOR locus. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and a humanized mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that RapaR-CAR-T cells can efficiently target CD19+ leukemia cells in presence of rapamycin. Furthermore, our strategy allows multiplexed targeting of rapamycin-regulated immunoreceptors complexes (DARICs) to the MTOR and TRAC loci to pharmacologically control CAR-T cells activity. We foresee that our approach could both facilitate the enrichment of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells ex vivo and in vivo while improving tumor eradication.\nCircadian regulation of MGMT expression and promoter methylation underlies daily rhythms in TMZ sensitivity in glioblastoma\nAuthors: Gonzalez-Aponte, M. F.; Damato, A. R.; Trebucq, L. L.; Simon, T.; Cardenas-Garcia, S. P.; Cho, K.; Patti, G. J.; Golombek, D. A.; Chiesa, J. J.; Herzog, E. D.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557630\nBackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite extensive research and clinical trials, median survival post-treatment remains at 15 months. Thus, all opportunities to optimize current treatments and improve patient outcomes should be considered. A recent retrospective clinical study found that taking TMZ in the morning compared to the evening was associated with a 6-month increase in median survival in patients with MGMT-methylated GBM. Here, we hypothesized that TMZ efficacy depends on time-of-day and O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in murine and human models of GBM. Methods and ResultsIn vitro recordings using real-time bioluminescence reporters revealed that GBM cells have intrinsic circadian rhythms in the expression of the core circadian clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, as well as in the DNA repair enzyme, MGMT. Independent measures of MGMT transcript levels and promoter methylation also showed daily rhythms intrinsic to GBM cells. These cells were more susceptible to TMZ when delivered at the daily peak of Bmal1 transcription. We found that in vivo morning administration of TMZ also decreased tumor size and increased body weight compared to evening drug delivery in mice bearing GBM xenografts. Finally, inhibition of MGMT activity with O6-Benzylguanine abrogated the daily rhythm in sensitivity to TMZ in vitro by increasing sensitivity at both the peak and trough of Bmal1 expression. ConclusionWe conclude that chemotherapy with TMZ can be dramatically enhanced by delivering at the daily maximum of tumor Bmal1 expression and minimum of MGMT activity.

We interrogated the effects of hypoxia on transcriptomes, epigenomes and translatomes of T47D breast cancer cells and H9 human embryonic stem cells. This revealed hypoxia-induced alterations in H3K4me3 associating with pervasive changes in transcription start site (TSS) selection, leading to 5UTR remodeling and a concomitant reshaping of translational landscapes. Importantly, this epigenetically driven reprogramming of translation is distinct from HIF1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms, and TSS switching appears to occur independently of alterations in transcript abundance. While TSS switching is coordinated with the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTOR-guided translational reprogramming, it also acts independently to regulate translation in hypoxia. Moreover, comparable TSS switching was observed following H3K4me3 accumulation in the absence of hypoxia, pinpointing H3K4me3 as underlying TSS selection. These results demonstrate a previously unappreciated mechanism of translational regulation driven by epigenetic reprogramming of the 5UTRome, which is orchestrated with other hypoxia-triggered adaptive mechanisms.\nA resource-based mechanistic framework for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)\nAuthors: Vibishan, B.; BV, H.; Dey, S.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558379\nCancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the system's description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.\nDe novo purine metabolism is a metabolic vulnerability of cancers with low p16 expression\nAuthors: Tangudu, N.

R.; Aird, K. M.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549149\np16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16/CDKN2A-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic human and mouse melanoma cell lines, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. In-deed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A ex-pression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16 knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16/Cdkn2a expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, includ-ing anti-folates. Tumors with p16 knockdown were more sensitive to the anti-folate methotrex-ate in vivo than control tumors. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16/CDKN2A-low tumors as loss of p16/CDKN2A may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.\nFGF19 and its analog Aldafermin cooperate with MYC to induce aggressive hepatocarcinogenesis\nAuthors: Ursic-Bedoya, J.; Desandre, G.; Chavey, C.; Marie, P.; Polizzi, A.; Riviere, B.; Guillou, H.; Assenat, E.; Hibner, U.; Gregoire, D.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557921\nFGF19 hormone has pleiotropic metabolic functions, notably the modulation of insulin sensitivity, glucose/lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. On top of its physiological metabolic role, FGF19 has been identified as a potentially targetable oncogenic driver, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, FGF19 remained an attractive candidate for treatment of metabolic disease, prompting the development of analogs uncoupling its metabolic and tumor-promoting activities. Using pre-clinical mice models of somatic mutation driven HCC, we assessed the oncogenicity of FGF19 in combination with frequent HCC tumorigenic alterations: p53 inactivation, CTNNB1 mutation, CCND1 or MYC overexpression. Our data revealed a strong oncogenic cooperation between FGF19 and MYC. Most importantly, we show that this oncogenic synergy is conserved with a FGF19-analog Aldafermin (NGM282), designed to solely mimic the hormones metabolic functions. In particular, even a short systemic treatment with recombinant proteins triggered rapid appearance of proliferative foci of MYC-expressing hepatocytes. The fact that FGF19 analog Aldafermin is not fully devoid of the hormones oncogenic properties raises concerns in the context of its potential use for patients with damaged, mutation-prone liver.\nPhase-separating fusion proteins drive cancer by dysregulating transcription through ectopic condensates\nAuthors: Farahi, N.; Lazar, T.; Tompa, P.; Meszaros, B.; Pancsa, R.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558425\nNumerous cellular processes rely on biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), thus, perturbations of LLPS underlie various diseases. We found that proteins initiating LLPS are frequently implicated in somatic cancers, even surpassing their involvement in neurodegeneration, where several such LLPS scaffolds are linked to disease emergence. Cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds are connected to all cancer hallmarks and tend to be oncogenes with dominant genetic effects currently lacking therapeutic options. Since most cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds exert their oncogenic effects as oncogenic fusion proteins (OFPs), we undertook a systematic analysis of known OFPs by assessing their module-level molecular functions. We identified both known and novel combinations of molecular functions that are specific to OFPs and thus have a high potential for driving tumorigenesis. Protein regions driving condensate formation show an increased association with DNA- or chromatin-binding domains of transcription regulators within OFPs, indicating a common molecular mechanism underlying several soft tissue sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies where phase-separation-prone OFPs form abnormal, ectopic condensates along the DNA, and thereby dysregulate gene expression programs.\nAcod1 Expression in Cancer Cells Promotes Immune Evasion through the Generation of Inhibitory Peptides\nAuthors: Schofield, J. H.; Longo, J.; Sheldon, R.; Albano, E.; Hawk, M. A.; Murphy, S.; Duong, L.; Rahmy, S.; Lu, X.; Jones, R. G.; Schafer, Z. T.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557799\nTargeting PD-1 is an important component of many immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapeutic approaches. However, ICB is not an efficacious strategy in a variety of cancer types, in part due to immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we find that PD-1-resistant cancer cells produce abundant itaconate (ITA) due to enhanced levels of aconitate decarboxylase (Acod1). Acod1 has an important role in the resistance to PD-1, as decreasing Acod1 levels in PD-1 resistant cancer cells can sensitize tumors to PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, cancer cells with high Acod1 inhibit the proliferation of naive CD8+ T cells through the secretion of inhibitory factors. Surprisingly, inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation is not dependent on secretion of ITA, but is instead a consequence of the release of small inhibitory peptides. Our study suggests that strategies to counter the activity of Acod1 in cancer cells may sensitize tumors to ICB therapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cancer research has predominantly targeted genetic mutations, while only recently has attention shifted to understanding tumor cell-stages. However, the key organizational principles guiding tumor dynamics towards sustainable growth remained unexplored. By analyzing tumor cell ensembles from individuals with glioblastoma through the lens of the healthy adult stem cell lineage, we identified astrocytes as central to glioblastoma progression. We found dormant tumor cells resembling astrocytes progressing to active and differentiated stages, building tumor pseudolineages that ultimately influence patient survival. These tumor stages align with specific methylomes, offering potential for patient classification. Our study identifies the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 as a missing factor in glioblastoma that plays a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to activation in the healthy lineage. Excitingly, re-introduction of SFRP1 in glioblastoma halts tumor dynamics, enhancing survival in a PDX model. This fresh view on glioblastomas underscores the importance of understanding tumor dynamics and unveils novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises when hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) acquire mutations in genes, including DNMT3A and TET2, conferring a competitive advantage through a mechanism that remains unclear. To gain insight into how CH mutations enable gradual clonal expansion, we used single-cell multi-omics with high-fidelity genotyping on CH bone marrow samples. Most of the selective advantage of mutant cells occurs within HSCs. DNMT3A and TET2-mutant clones expand further in early progenitors, while TET2 mutations accelerate myeloid maturation in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, both mutant and non-mutant HSCs from CH samples are enriched for inflammatory and aging transcriptomic signatures, compared to HSC from non-CH samples, revealing a non-cell autonomous mechanism. However, DNMT3A and TET2-mutant HSCs have an attenuated inflammatory response relative to wild-type HSCs within the same sample. Our data support a model whereby CH clones are gradually selected because they are more resistant to the deleterious impact of inflammation and aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) reprogram T cells to recognize and target cancer cells. Despite remarkable responses observed with CAR-T cell therapy in patients with hematological malignancies, CAR-T cell engineering still relies mostly on randomly integrating vectors, limiting the possibilities of fine-tuning T cell function. Here, we designed a CRISPR-based marker-free selection strategy to simultaneously target a therapeutic transgene and a gain-of-function mutation to the MTOR locus to enrich cells resistant to rapamycin, a clinically used immunosuppressant. We readily engineered rapamycin-resistant (RapaR) CAR-T cells by targeting CAR expression cassettes to the MTOR locus. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and a humanized mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that RapaR-CAR-T cells can efficiently target CD19&#43; leukemia cells in presence of rapamycin. Furthermore, our strategy allows multiplexed targeting of rapamycin-regulated immunoreceptors complexes (DARICs) to the MTOR and TRAC loci to pharmacologically control CAR-T cells activity. We foresee that our approach could both facilitate the enrichment of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells ex vivo and in vivo while improving tumor eradication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite extensive research and clinical trials, median survival post-treatment remains at 15 months. Thus, all opportunities to optimize current treatments and improve patient outcomes should be considered. A recent retrospective clinical study found that taking TMZ in the morning compared to the evening was associated with a 6-month increase in median survival in patients with MGMT-methylated GBM. Here, we hypothesized that TMZ efficacy depends on time-of-day and O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in murine and human models of GBM.

Methods and ResultsIn vitro recordings using real-time bioluminescence reporters revealed that GBM cells have intrinsic circadian rhythms in the expression of the core circadian clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, as well as in the DNA repair enzyme, MGMT. Independent measures of MGMT transcript levels and promoter methylation also showed daily rhythms intrinsic to GBM cells. These cells were more susceptible to TMZ when delivered at the daily peak of Bmal1 transcription. We found that in vivo morning administration of TMZ also decreased tumor size and increased body weight compared to evening drug delivery in mice bearing GBM xenografts. Finally, inhibition of MGMT activity with O6-Benzylguanine abrogated the daily rhythm in sensitivity to TMZ in vitro by increasing sensitivity at both the peak and trough of Bmal1 expression.

ConclusionWe conclude that chemotherapy with TMZ can be dramatically enhanced by delivering at the daily maximum of tumor Bmal1 expression and minimum of MGMT activity.

        <p class="abstract">Adaptation to stresses entails coordination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. We interrogated the effects of hypoxia on transcriptomes, epigenomes and translatomes of T47D breast cancer cells and H9 human embryonic stem cells. This revealed hypoxia-induced alterations in H3K4me3 associating with pervasive changes in transcription start site (TSS) selection, leading to 5UTR remodeling and a concomitant reshaping of translational landscapes. Importantly, this epigenetically driven reprogramming of translation is distinct from HIF1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms, and TSS switching appears to occur independently of alterations in transcript abundance. While TSS switching is coordinated with the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTOR-guided translational reprogramming, it also acts independently to regulate translation in hypoxia. Moreover, comparable TSS switching was observed following H3K4me3 accumulation in the absence of hypoxia, pinpointing H3K4me3 as underlying TSS selection. These results demonstrate a previously unappreciated mechanism of translational regulation driven by epigenetic reprogramming of the 5UTRome, which is orchestrated with other hypoxia-triggered adaptive mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the system&#39;s description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">p16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16/CDKN2A-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic human and mouse melanoma cell lines, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. In-deed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A ex-pression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16 knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16/Cdkn2a expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, includ-ing anti-folates. Tumors with p16 knockdown were more sensitive to the anti-folate methotrex-ate in vivo than control tumors. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16/CDKN2A-low tumors as loss of p16/CDKN2A may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">FGF19 hormone has pleiotropic metabolic functions, notably the modulation of insulin sensitivity, glucose/lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. On top of its physiological metabolic role, FGF19 has been identified as a potentially targetable oncogenic driver, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, FGF19 remained an attractive candidate for treatment of metabolic disease, prompting the development of analogs uncoupling its metabolic and tumor-promoting activities.

Using pre-clinical mice models of somatic mutation driven HCC, we assessed the oncogenicity of FGF19 in combination with frequent HCC tumorigenic alterations: p53 inactivation, CTNNB1 mutation, CCND1 or MYC overexpression. Our data revealed a strong oncogenic cooperation between FGF19 and MYC. Most importantly, we show that this oncogenic synergy is conserved with a FGF19-analog Aldafermin (NGM282), designed to solely mimic the hormones metabolic functions. In particular, even a short systemic treatment with recombinant proteins triggered rapid appearance of proliferative foci of MYC-expressing hepatocytes.

The fact that FGF19 analog Aldafermin is not fully devoid of the hormones oncogenic properties raises concerns in the context of its potential use for patients with damaged, mutation-prone liver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Numerous cellular processes rely on biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), thus, perturbations of LLPS underlie various diseases. We found that proteins initiating LLPS are frequently implicated in somatic cancers, even surpassing their involvement in neurodegeneration, where several such LLPS scaffolds are linked to disease emergence. Cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds are connected to all cancer hallmarks and tend to be oncogenes with dominant genetic effects currently lacking therapeutic options. Since most cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds exert their oncogenic effects as oncogenic fusion proteins (OFPs), we undertook a systematic analysis of known OFPs by assessing their module-level molecular functions. We identified both known and novel combinations of molecular functions that are specific to OFPs and thus have a high potential for driving tumorigenesis. Protein regions driving condensate formation show an increased association with DNA- or chromatin-binding domains of transcription regulators within OFPs, indicating a common molecular mechanism underlying several soft tissue sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies where phase-separation-prone OFPs form abnormal, ectopic condensates along the DNA, and thereby dysregulate gene expression programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting PD-1 is an important component of many immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapeutic approaches. However, ICB is not an efficacious strategy in a variety of cancer types, in part due to immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we find that PD-1-resistant cancer cells produce abundant itaconate (ITA) due to enhanced levels of aconitate decarboxylase (Acod1). Acod1 has an important role in the resistance to PD-1, as decreasing Acod1 levels in PD-1 resistant cancer cells can sensitize tumors to PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, cancer cells with high Acod1 inhibit the proliferation of naive CD8&#43; T cells through the secretion of inhibitory factors. Surprisingly, inhibition of CD8&#43; T cell proliferation is not dependent on secretion of ITA, but is instead a consequence of the release of small inhibitory peptides. Our study suggests that strategies to counter the activity of Acod1 in cancer cells may sensitize tumors to ICB therapy.</p>
