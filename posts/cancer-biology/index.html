The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors were recently approved in LUAD, but clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples we found inhibition of KRAS promotes transition to a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. Similarly, suppressing Kras induced AT1 differentiation of wild-type AT2 cells upon lung injury. The AT1-like LUAD cells exhibited high growth and differentiation potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells robustly improved treatment response to KRAS inhibitors. Our results uncover an unexpected role for KRAS in promoting intra-tumoral heterogeneity and suggest targeting alveolar differentiation may augment KRAS-targeted therapies in LUAD. SignificanceTreatment resistance limits response to KRAS inhibitors in LUAD patients. We find LUAD residual disease following KRAS targeting is composed of AT1-like cancer cells with the capacity to reignite tumorigenesis. Targeting the AT1-like cells augments responses to KRAS inhibition, elucidating a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS-targeted therapy.\nSelective Mitochondrial Respiratory Complex I Subunit Deficiency Causes Tumor Immunogenicity\nAuthors: Liang, J.; Vitale, T.; Zhang, X.; Jackson, T. D.; Yu, D.; Jedrychowsk, M.; Gygi, S. P.; Widlund, H. R.; Wucherpfennig, K.; Puigserver, P.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560316\nTargeting of specific metabolic pathways in tumor cells has the potential to sensitize them to immune-mediated attack. Here we provide evidence for a specific means of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) inhibition that improves tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Targeted genetic deletion of the CI subunits Ndufs4 and Ndufs6, but not other subunits, induces an immune-dependent tumor growth attenuation in mouse melanoma models. We show that deletion of Ndufs4 induces expression of the transcription factor Nlrc5 and genes in the MHC class I antigen presentation and processing pathway. This induction of MHC-related genes is driven by an accumulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent mitochondrial acetyl-CoA downstream of CI subunit deletion. This work provides a novel functional modality by which selective CI inhibition restricts tumor growth, suggesting that specific targeting of Ndufs4, or related CI subunits, increases T-cell mediated immunity and sensitivity to ICB.\nMapping the tumor stress network reveals dynamic shifts in the stromal oxidative stress response\nAuthors: Lior, C.; Barki, D.; Kelsen, D.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, C.; Scherz-Shouval, R.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560126\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) is a challenging environment where cells must cope with stressful conditions such as fluctuating pH levels, hypoxia, and free radicals. In response, stress pathways are activated, which can both promote and inhibit tumorigenesis. In this study, we set out to characterize the stress response landscape across four carcinomas: breast, pancreas, ovary, and prostate tumors, focusing on five pathways: Heat shock response, oxidative stress response, unfolded protein response, hypoxia stress response, and DNA damage response. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we create an atlas of the stress response landscape across various types of carcinomas. We find that stress responses are heterogeneously activated in the TME, and highly activated near cancer cells. Focusing on the non-immune stroma we find, across tumor types, that NRF2 and the oxidative stress response are distinctly activated in immune-regulatory cancer-associated fibroblasts and in a unique subset of cancer associated pericytes. Our study thus provides an interactome of stress responses in cancer, offering new ways to intersect survival pathways within the tumor, and advance cancer therapy.\nTargeting Acute Myeloid Leukemia Stem Cells Through Perturbation of Mitochondrial Calcium\nAuthors: Sheth, A. I.; Engel, K.; Tolison, H.; Althoff, M. J.; Amaya, M. L.; Krug, A.; Young, T.; Pei, S.; Patel, S. B.; Minhajuddin, M.; Winters, A.; Miller, R.; Shelton, I.; St-Germain, J.; Ling, T.; Jones, C.; Raught, B.; Gillen, A. E.; Ransom, M. R.; Staggs, S.; Smith, C.; Pollyea, D. A.; Stevens, B. M.; Jordan, C. T.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560330\nWe previously reported that acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are uniquely reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for survival. Moreover, maintenance of OXPHOS is dependent on BCL2, creating a therapeutic opportunity to target LSCs using the BCL2 inhibitor drug venetoclax. While venetoclax-based regimens have indeed shown promising clinical activity, the emergence of drug resistance is prevalent. Thus, in the present study, we investigated how mitochondrial properties may influence mechanisms that dictate venetoclax responsiveness. Our data show that utilization of mitochondrial calcium is fundamentally different between drug responsive and non-responsive LSCs. By comparison, venetoclax-resistant LSCs demonstrate a more active metabolic (i.e., OXPHOS) status with relatively high steady-state levels of calcium. Consequently, we tested genetic and pharmacological approaches to target the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. We demonstrate that inhibition of calcium uptake sharply reduces OXPHOS and leads to eradication of venetoclax-resistant LSCs. These findings demonstrate a central role for calcium signaling in the biology of LSCs and provide a therapeutic avenue for clinical management of venetoclax resistance. SignificanceWe identify increased utilization of mitochondrial calcium as distinct metabolic requirement of venetoclax-resistant LSCs and demonstrate the potential of targeting mitochondrial calcium uptake as a therapeutic strategy.\nNuclear speckles regulate HIF-2α programs and correlate with patient survival in kidney cancer\nAuthors: Alexander, K. A.; Yu, R.; Skuli, N.; Coffey, N. J.; Nguyen, S.; Faunce, C.; Huang, H.; Dardani, I.; Good, A. L.; Lim, J.; Li, C.; Biddle, N.; Joyce, E. F.; Raj, A.; Lee, D.; Keith, B.; Simon, M. C.; Berger, S. L.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557228\nNuclear speckles are membrane-less bodies within the cell nucleus enriched in RNA biogenesis, processing, and export factors. In this study we investigated speckle phenotype variation in human cancer, finding a reproducible speckle signature, based on RNA expression of speckle-resident proteins, across \u003e20 cancer types. Of these, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibited a clear correlation between the presence of this speckle expression signature, imaging-based speckle phenotype, and clinical outcomes. ccRCC is typified by hyperactivation of the HIF-2 transcription factor, and we demonstrate here that HIF-2 drives physical association of a select subset of its target genes with nuclear speckles. Disruption of HIF-2-driven speckle association via deletion of its speckle targeting motifs (STMs)--defined in this study--led to defective induction of speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes without impacting non-speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes. We further identify the RNA export complex, TREX, as being specifically altered in speckle signature, and knockdown of key TREX component, ALYREF, also compromises speckle-associated gene expression. By integrating tissue culture functional studies with tumor genomic and imaging analysis, we show that HIF-2 gene regulatory programs are impacted by specific manipulation of speckle phenotype and by abrogation of speckle targeting abilities of HIF-2. These findings suggest that, in ccRCC, a key biological function of nuclear speckles is to modulate expression of a specific subset of HIF-2-regulated target genes that, in turn, influence patient outcomes. We also identify STMs in other transcription factors, suggesting that DNA-speckle targeting may be a general mechanism of gene regulation. HIGHLIGHTS- Nuclear speckles shown to reproducibly vary in cancer, predicting patient survival in ccRCC - HIF-2 drives DNA/gene-speckle contacts dependent on identified speckle targeting motifs within HIF-2 - Putative speckle targeting motifs are highly enriched among regulators of gene expression - Partitioning of transcription factor functional programs may be a major biological function of nuclear speckles\nExpression of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein mimics human CIC-rearranged sarcoma in genetically engineered mouse models\nAuthors: Hendrickson, P. G.; Oristian, K. M.; Browne, M. R.; Lou, L.; Ma, Y.; Cardona, D. M.; Linardic, C. M.; Kirsch, D. G.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559519\nCIC-DUX4 sarcoma (CDS) is a rare but highly aggressive undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma driven by a fusion between the tumor suppressor Capicua (CIC) and DUX4. Currently, there are no effective treatments and efforts to identify and translate better therapies are limited by the scarcity of tissues and patients. To address this limitation, we generated three genetically engineered mouse models of CDS (Ch7CDS, Ai9CDS, and TOPCDS). Remarkably, chimeric mice from all three conditional models developed spontaneous tumors and widespread metastasis in the absence of Cre-recombinase. The penetrance of spontaneous (Cre-independent) tumor formation was complete irrespective of bi-allelic CIC function and loxP site proximity. Characterization of primary and metastatic mouse tumors showed that they consistently expressed the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein as well as other downstream markers of the disease credentialing these models as CDS. In addition, tumor-derived cell lines were generated and ChIP-seq was preformed to map fusion-gene specific binding using an N-terminal HA epitope tag. These datasets, along with paired H3K27ac ChIP-seq maps, validate CIC-DUX4 as a neomorphic transcriptional activator. Moreover, they are consistent with a model where ETS family transcription factors are cooperative and redundant drivers of the core regulatory circuitry in CDS.\nClonal fitness decline in somatic differentiation hierarchies\nAuthors: Ahmed, I.; Dingli, D.; Huang, W.; Werner, B.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559763\nThe concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.\nA resource-based mechanistic framework for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)\nAuthors: Vibishan, B.; BV, H.; Dey, S.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558379\nCancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC. HighlightsO_LICancer growth and progression can be driven by intra-tumour interactions. C_LIO_LIProstate cancer cells compete among each other for resources like testosterone and oxygen. C_LIO_LIWe model these interactions using a modified logistic model with resource dynamics. C_LIO_LIEquilibrium behaviour can be understood through resource supply and use efficiency. C_LIO_LIExplicitly ecological models could enable better strategies for cancer control.

S.; Shibata, D.; Gatenby, R.; Cisneros, L.; Troan, B.; Anderson, A. R. A.; Maley, C. C.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558136\nHighly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER+ breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P \u003c 0.01) and combined drugs (P \u003c 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.\nLoss of STIM2 in colorectal cancer drives growth and metastasis through metabolic reprogramming and PERK-ATF4 endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway\nAuthors: Pathak, T.; Benson, J. C.; Johnson, M. T.; Xin, P.; Abdelnaby, A. E.; Walter, V.; Kultun, W. A.; Yochum, G. S.; Hempel, N.; Trebak, M.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560521\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores large amounts of calcium (Ca2+), and the controlled release of ER Ca2+ regulates a myriad of cellular functions. Although altered ER Ca2+ homeostasis is known to induce ER stress, the mechanisms by which ER Ca2+ imbalance activate ER stress pathways are poorly understood. Stromal-interacting molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are two structurally homologous ER-resident Ca2+ sensors that synergistically regulate Ca2+ influx into the cytosol through Orai Ca2+ channels for subsequent signaling to transcription and ER Ca2+ refilling. Here, we demonstrate that reduced STIM2, but not STIM1, in colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor patient prognosis. Loss of STIM2 causes SERCA2-dependent increase in ER Ca2+, increased protein translation and transcriptional and metabolic rewiring supporting increased tumor size, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, STIM2 loss activates cMyc and the PERK/ATF4 branch of ER stress in an Orai-independent manner. Therefore, STIM2 and PERK/ATF4 could be exploited for prognosis or in targeted therapies to inhibit CRC tumor growth and metastasis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), commonly driven by KRAS mutations, is responsible for 7% of all cancer mortality. The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors were recently approved in LUAD, but clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples we found inhibition of KRAS promotes transition to a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. Similarly, suppressing Kras induced AT1 differentiation of wild-type AT2 cells upon lung injury. The AT1-like LUAD cells exhibited high growth and differentiation potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells robustly improved treatment response to KRAS inhibitors. Our results uncover an unexpected role for KRAS in promoting intra-tumoral heterogeneity and suggest targeting alveolar differentiation may augment KRAS-targeted therapies in LUAD.

SignificanceTreatment resistance limits response to KRAS inhibitors in LUAD patients. We find LUAD residual disease following KRAS targeting is composed of AT1-like cancer cells with the capacity to reignite tumorigenesis. Targeting the AT1-like cells augments responses to KRAS inhibition, elucidating a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS-targeted therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting of specific metabolic pathways in tumor cells has the potential to sensitize them to immune-mediated attack. Here we provide evidence for a specific means of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) inhibition that improves tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Targeted genetic deletion of the CI subunits Ndufs4 and Ndufs6, but not other subunits, induces an immune-dependent tumor growth attenuation in mouse melanoma models. We show that deletion of Ndufs4 induces expression of the transcription factor Nlrc5 and genes in the MHC class I antigen presentation and processing pathway. This induction of MHC-related genes is driven by an accumulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent mitochondrial acetyl-CoA downstream of CI subunit deletion. This work provides a novel functional modality by which selective CI inhibition restricts tumor growth, suggesting that specific targeting of Ndufs4, or related CI subunits, increases T-cell mediated immunity and sensitivity to ICB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a challenging environment where cells must cope with stressful conditions such as fluctuating pH levels, hypoxia, and free radicals. In response, stress pathways are activated, which can both promote and inhibit tumorigenesis. In this study, we set out to characterize the stress response landscape across four carcinomas: breast, pancreas, ovary, and prostate tumors, focusing on five pathways: Heat shock response, oxidative stress response, unfolded protein response, hypoxia stress response, and DNA damage response. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we create an atlas of the stress response landscape across various types of carcinomas. We find that stress responses are heterogeneously activated in the TME, and highly activated near cancer cells. Focusing on the non-immune stroma we find, across tumor types, that NRF2 and the oxidative stress response are distinctly activated in immune-regulatory cancer-associated fibroblasts and in a unique subset of cancer associated pericytes. Our study thus provides an interactome of stress responses in cancer, offering new ways to intersect survival pathways within the tumor, and advance cancer therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We previously reported that acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are uniquely reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for survival. Moreover, maintenance of OXPHOS is dependent on BCL2, creating a therapeutic opportunity to target LSCs using the BCL2 inhibitor drug venetoclax. While venetoclax-based regimens have indeed shown promising clinical activity, the emergence of drug resistance is prevalent. Thus, in the present study, we investigated how mitochondrial properties may influence mechanisms that dictate venetoclax responsiveness. Our data show that utilization of mitochondrial calcium is fundamentally different between drug responsive and non-responsive LSCs. By comparison, venetoclax-resistant LSCs demonstrate a more active metabolic (i.e., OXPHOS) status with relatively high steady-state levels of calcium. Consequently, we tested genetic and pharmacological approaches to target the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. We demonstrate that inhibition of calcium uptake sharply reduces OXPHOS and leads to eradication of venetoclax-resistant LSCs. These findings demonstrate a central role for calcium signaling in the biology of LSCs and provide a therapeutic avenue for clinical management of venetoclax resistance.

SignificanceWe identify increased utilization of mitochondrial calcium as distinct metabolic requirement of venetoclax-resistant LSCs and demonstrate the potential of targeting mitochondrial calcium uptake as a therapeutic strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear speckles are membrane-less bodies within the cell nucleus enriched in RNA biogenesis, processing, and export factors. In this study we investigated speckle phenotype variation in human cancer, finding a reproducible speckle signature, based on RNA expression of speckle-resident proteins, across &gt;20 cancer types. Of these, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibited a clear correlation between the presence of this speckle expression signature, imaging-based speckle phenotype, and clinical outcomes. ccRCC is typified by hyperactivation of the HIF-2 transcription factor, and we demonstrate here that HIF-2 drives physical association of a select subset of its target genes with nuclear speckles. Disruption of HIF-2-driven speckle association via deletion of its speckle targeting motifs (STMs)--defined in this study--led to defective induction of speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes without impacting non-speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes. We further identify the RNA export complex, TREX, as being specifically altered in speckle signature, and knockdown of key TREX component, ALYREF, also compromises speckle-associated gene expression. By integrating tissue culture functional studies with tumor genomic and imaging analysis, we show that HIF-2 gene regulatory programs are impacted by specific manipulation of speckle phenotype and by abrogation of speckle targeting abilities of HIF-2. These findings suggest that, in ccRCC, a key biological function of nuclear speckles is to modulate expression of a specific subset of HIF-2-regulated target genes that, in turn, influence patient outcomes. We also identify STMs in other transcription factors, suggesting that DNA-speckle targeting may be a general mechanism of gene regulation.

HIGHLIGHTS- Nuclear speckles shown to reproducibly vary in cancer, predicting patient survival in ccRCC
- HIF-2 drives DNA/gene-speckle contacts dependent on identified speckle targeting motifs within HIF-2
- Putative speckle targeting motifs are highly enriched among regulators of gene expression
- Partitioning of transcription factor functional programs may be a major biological function of nuclear speckles</p>

        <p class="abstract">CIC-DUX4 sarcoma (CDS) is a rare but highly aggressive undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma driven by a fusion between the tumor suppressor Capicua (CIC) and DUX4. Currently, there are no effective treatments and efforts to identify and translate better therapies are limited by the scarcity of tissues and patients. To address this limitation, we generated three genetically engineered mouse models of CDS (Ch7CDS, Ai9CDS, and TOPCDS). Remarkably, chimeric mice from all three conditional models developed spontaneous tumors and widespread metastasis in the absence of Cre-recombinase. The penetrance of spontaneous (Cre-independent) tumor formation was complete irrespective of bi-allelic CIC function and loxP site proximity. Characterization of primary and metastatic mouse tumors showed that they consistently expressed the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein as well as other downstream markers of the disease credentialing these models as CDS. In addition, tumor-derived cell lines were generated and ChIP-seq was preformed to map fusion-gene specific binding using an N-terminal HA epitope tag. These datasets, along with paired H3K27ac ChIP-seq maps, validate CIC-DUX4 as a neomorphic transcriptional activator. Moreover, they are consistent with a model where ETS family transcription factors are cooperative and redundant drivers of the core regulatory circuitry in CDS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The concept of clonal fitness is fundamental to describe the evolutionary dynamics in somatic tissues. It is now well established that otherwise healthy somatic tissues become increasingly populated by expanding clones with age. However, the dynamic properties and respective fitnesses of these clones are less well understood. Here we show, that in somatic tissues organised as a differentiation hierarchy, theory predicts a natural decline of effective clonal fitness over time in the absence of additional driver events. This decline is intrinsic to the tissue organisation and can be captured quantitatively by a simple heuristic equation that is proportional to 1/time. We also show that the expected fitness decline is directly observable in human haematopoiesis. The predicted short and long term dynamics agree with in vivo observations using data of Neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplants and naturally progressing Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (CLL). We further show that theory predicts the existence of a long term equilibrium fitness. All CLL patients transition into a stable equilibrium fitness eventually. We find significant inter-patient variation of long term fitness and a strong correlation with disease aggressiveness. Interestingly, CLL long term fitness can be forecast based on the early stages of disease progression, suggesting a Big Bang like model for CLL evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.

        <p class="abstract">Highly effective cancer therapies often face limitations due to acquired resistance and toxicity. Adaptive therapy, an ecologically inspired approach, seeks to control therapeutic resistance and minimize toxicity by leveraging competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones, prioritizing patient survival and quality of life over maximum cell kill. In preparation for a clinical trial in breast cancer, we used large populations of MCF7 cells to rapidly generate endocrine-resistance breast cancer cell line. We then mimicked second line therapy in ER&#43; breast cancers by treating the endocrine-resistant MCF7 cells in a mouse xenograft model to test adaptive therapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or the combination of those two drugs. Dose-modulation adaptive therapy with capecitabine alone increased survival time relative to MTD, but not statistically significant (HR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.043-1.1 P = 0.065). However, when we alternated the drugs in both dose modulation (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.024 - 0.55, P = 0.007) and intermittent adaptive therapies significantly increased survival time compared to high dose combination therapy (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.42; P = 0.003). Overall, survival time increased with reduced dose for both single drugs (P &lt; 0.01) and combined drugs (P &lt; 0.001). Adaptive therapy protocols resulted in tumors with lower proportions of proliferating cells (P = 0.0026) and more apoptotic cells (P = 0.045). The results show that Adaptive therapy outperforms high-dose therapy in controlling endocrine-resistant breast cancer, favoring slower-growing tumors, and showing promise in two-drug alternating regimens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores large amounts of calcium (Ca2&#43;), and the controlled release of ER Ca2&#43; regulates a myriad of cellular functions. Although altered ER Ca2&#43; homeostasis is known to induce ER stress, the mechanisms by which ER Ca2&#43; imbalance activate ER stress pathways are poorly understood. Stromal-interacting molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are two structurally homologous ER-resident Ca2&#43; sensors that synergistically regulate Ca2&#43; influx into the cytosol through Orai Ca2&#43; channels for subsequent signaling to transcription and ER Ca2&#43; refilling. Here, we demonstrate that reduced STIM2, but not STIM1, in colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor patient prognosis. Loss of STIM2 causes SERCA2-dependent increase in ER Ca2&#43;, increased protein translation and transcriptional and metabolic rewiring supporting increased tumor size, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, STIM2 loss activates cMyc and the PERK/ATF4 branch of ER stress in an Orai-independent manner. Therefore, STIM2 and PERK/ATF4 could be exploited for prognosis or in targeted therapies to inhibit CRC tumor growth and metastasis.</p>
