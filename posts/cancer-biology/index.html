However, it remains unclear which of the cellular processes are most perturbed upon PP2A inhibition and how these perturbations could be exploited therapeutically. We report an unanticipated sensitivity of the splicing machinery to phosphorylation changes in response to PP2A inhibition by LB-100 in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observe enrichment for differentially phosphorylated sites within cancer-critical splicing nodes of U2 snRNP, SRSF and hnRNP proteins. Altered phosphorylation endows LB-100-treated colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with differential splicing patterns. In PP2A-inhibited cells, over 1000 events of exon skipping and intron retention affect regulators of genomic integrity. Finally, LB-100-evoked alternative splicing is predicted to be a source of neoantigens that can improve cancer treatment responses to immune modulators. Our findings provide a potential explanation for the pre-clinical and clinical observations that PP2A inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade and genotoxic agents.\nOncogene EVI1 Drives Acute Myeloid Leukemia Via a Targetable Interaction with CTBP2\nAuthors: Pastoors, D.; Havermans, M.; Mulet-Lazaro, R.; Brian, D.; Noort, W.; Grasel, J.; Hoogenboezem, R.; Smeenk, L.; Demmers, J. A.; Enver, T.; Groen, R. W.; Bindels, E.; Delwel, R.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548358\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by the activation of EVI1 due to chromosome 3q26/MECOM rearrangements is incurable. Since transcription factors like EVI1 are notoriously hard to target, insight into the mechanism by which EVI1 drives myeloid transformation could provide alternative avenues for therapy. Applying protein folding predictions combined with proteomics technologies we demonstrate interaction with CTBP1 and CTBP2 via a single PLDLS motif in EVI1 is indispensable for leukemic transformation. A 4x PLDLS repeat construct outcompetes binding of EVI1 to CTBP1 and CTBP2 and inhibits proliferation of 3q26/MECOM rearranged AML in vitro and in xenotransplant models. This proof-of-concept study opens the possibility to target one of the most incurable forms of AML with specific EVI1-CTBP inhibitors. Our findings may also have important implications for other tumour types with aberrant expression of EVI1 or for cancers transformed by other CTBP1/2 dependent oncogenic transcription factors.\nIn Vivo Monitoring of Cellular Senescence by Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Imaging Utilizing a Nanostructured Organic Probe\nAuthors: Baker, A. G.; Ou, H.-L.; Hartono, M.; Popov, A. B.; Brown, E. L.; Joseph, J.; Golinska, M.; Sanghera, C.; Gonzalez-Gualda, E.; Macias, D.; Else, T. R.; Greer, H. F.; Vernet, A.; Bohndiek, S.

Despite the impact of senescence in diseases, the development of tools to monitor the senescent burden in vivo remains a challenge due to their suboptimal specificity, translatability, and tissue penetrance. Here, we have designed a nanostructured organic probe (NanoJaggs) based on biocompatible indocyanine green dye (ICG) building blocks forming J-aggregates, which possess distinct spectral properties allowing both fluorescence and photoacoustic tomography (PAT) detection. We show that NanoJaggs are taken up by an active process of endocytosis and exhibit selective accumulation at the lysosomal compartment in several in vitro models for senescence. Finally, NanoJagg probe is validated in two in vivo studies including live PAT imaging and shows remarkable specificity to tumours with chemotherapy-induced senescence compared to untreated proliferative tumors. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable tool for detection of senescence and their robust PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescent burden in solid tumors after chemo or radiotherapy.\nIn vivo single-cell CRISPR uncovers distinct TNF-alphaprograms in clonal expansion and tumorigenesis\nAuthors: Renz, P. F.; Ghoshdastider, U.; Baghai Sain, S.; Valdivia-Francia, F.; Khandekar, A.; Ormiston, M.; Bernasconi, M.; Kretz, J. A.; Lee, M.; Hyams, K.; Forny, M.; Pohly, M.; Ficht, X.; Ellis, S. J.; Moor, A. E.; Sendoel, A.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548697\nThe tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions occur frequently in human epithelia and can remodel almost entire tissues, the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing, guide capture and spatial transcriptomics to longitudinally monitor cell type-specific clonal expansions, document their underlying gene programs and contrast clonal expansions from tumor initiation. We uncover a TNF- signaling module that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF- signaling module is downregulated, and instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF- gene program. By analyzing clonally expanded perturbations and their frequency in tumors, we demonstrate that the autocrine TNF- gene program is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is preexistent in a subpopulation of expanded epidermal stem cells, contributing to the predisposition for tumor initiation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the epithelial TNF- gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties of epidermal stem cells and show that the TNF- signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues and unveils distinct TNF- programs in tumor evolution. Understanding the biology of clonal expansions in phenotypically normal epithelia and the mechanisms governing their transformation will guide the development of novel strategies for early cancer detection and therapy.\nIntegrative spatial analysis reveals a multi-layered organization of glioblastoma\nAuthors: Greenwald, A.

L.; Tirosh, I.\nScore: 81.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547924\nGlioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Hypoxic regions are associated with a unique histology of pseudopalisading cells, while other regions appear to have limited histological organization, reflecting the diffuse nature of glioma cells. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics with spatial proteomics and novel computational approaches to define glioma cellular states at high granularity and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of cellular organization. First, cells in any given state tend to be spatially clustered, such that tumors are composed of small local environments that are each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. Despite the unique composition of each tumor, this pairing of states remains largely consistent across tumors. Third, the pairwise interactions that we detect collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive this 5-layered organization, as it is both associated with unique states of surrounding cells and with a long-range organization that extends from the hypoxic core to the infiltrative edge of the tumor. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of gliomas at the resolution of cellular states and highlight the role of hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.\nHATCHet2: clone- and haplotype-specific copy number inference from bulk tumor sequencing data\nAuthors: Myers, M. A.; Arnold, B. J.; Bansal, V.; Mullen, K. M.; Zaccaria, S.; Raphael, B. J.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548855\nMulti-region DNA sequencing of primary tumors and metastases from individual patients helps identify somatic aberrations driving cancer development. However, most methods to infer copy-number aberrations (CNAs) analyze individual samples. We introduce HATCHet2 to identify haplotype- and clone-specific CNAs simultaneously from multiple bulk samples. HATCHet2 introduces a novel statistic, the mirrored haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), to identify mirrored-subclonal CNAs having different numbers of copies of parental haplotypes in different tumor clones. HATCHet2 also has high accuracy in identifying focal CNAs and extends the earlier HATCHet method in several directions. We demonstrate HATCHet2s improved accuracy using simulations and a single-cell sequencing dataset. HATCHet2 analysis of 50 prostate cancer samples from 10 patients reveals previously-unreported mirrored-subclonal CNAs affecting cancer genes.\nIntegrative analyses uncover mechanisms by which aging drives B cell lymphoma\nAuthors: Castro, J. P.; Shindyapina, A. V.; Barbieri, A.; Ying, K.; Strelkova, O. S.; Paulo, J. A.; Tyshkovskiy, A.; Meinl, R.; Kerepesi, C.; Petrashen, A. P.; Mariotti, M.; Meer, M.; Hu, Y.; Karamyshev, A.; Losyev, G.; Indzhykulian, A. A.; Gygi, S. P.; Sedivy, J. M.; Manis, J. P.; Gladyshev, V. N.\nScore: 28.3, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2021.02.23.432500\nWhile cancer is an age-related disease, many cancer studies utilize younger animal models. Here, we uncover how a cancer, B-cell lymphoma, develops as a consequence of a naturally aged system. We show that this malignancy is associated with increased cell size, splenomegaly, and a newly discovered age-associated clonal B-cell (ACBC) population. Driven by exogenous c-Myc activation, hypermethylated promoters and somatic mutations, ACBC cells clonally expand independent of germinal centers (IgM+) and show increased biological age and hypomethylation in partially methylated domains related to mitotic solo-CpGs. Epigenetic changes in transformed mouse B cells are enriched for changes observed in human B-cell lymphomas. Mechanistically, the data suggest that cancerous ACBC cells originate from age-associated B cells, in part involving CD22 protein signaling fostered by the aging microenvironment. Transplantation assays demonstrate that ACBC evolve to become self-sufficient and support malignancy when transferred into young recipients. Inhibition of mTOR or c-Myc in old mice attenuates premalignant changes in B cells during aging and emerges as a therapeutic strategy to delay the onset of age-related lymphoma. Together, we show how aging contributes to B-cell lymphoma through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving cell-intrinsic changes and the aged microenvironment, characterize a model that captures the origin and progression of spontaneous cancer during aging and identify candidate interventions against age-associated lymphoma.\nIntestinal LKB1 loss drives a pre-malignant program along the serrated cancer pathway\nAuthors: Plugge, S. F.; Ma, H.; van der Vaart, J. Y.; Sprangers, J.; Morsink, F. H. M.; Xanthakis, D.; Jamieson, C.; Keijzer, A. R.; Margaritis, T.; Candelli, T.; Straver, R.; de Ridder, J.; Holstege, F. C. P.; de Leng, W. W. J.; Offerhaus, G. J. A.; Merenda, A.; Maurice, M. M.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.548873\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a familial disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) mutations that promote gastrointestinal polyposis and enhance cancer susceptibility. How LKB1-deficiency alters the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues to mediate increased cancer risk remains poorly understood. Here, we employ small intestinal organoids to investigate these issues for heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1 epithelial loss. We show that Lkb1 loss causes an allele dosage-dependent activation of a transcriptional program for tissue repair that is already induced in stem cell populations and mediates alterations in secretory cell type morphology and positioning. Furthermore, this shift towards a regenerative state omits the need for EGF supplementation, thus inducing niche-independent properties. Strikingly, we uncover that heterozygous loss of Lkb1 is sufficient to push the epithelium into a premalignant program for colorectal carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or Kras mutations. We conclude that persistent upregulation of a regenerative program due to LKB1 loss alters cellular hierarchy and induces niche independency, which predisposes PJS epithelium to uncontrolled growth along the serrated pathway.\nDe novo purine metabolism is a metabolic vulnerability of cancers with low p16 expression\nAuthors: Tangudu, N. K.; Buj, R.; Wang, J.; Cole, A. R.; Uboveja, A.; Fang, R.; Amalric, A.; Lyons, M. A.; Chandran, U. R.; Aird, K. M.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549149\np16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic melanoma cell lines with wildtype p16/CDKN2A and p16/CDKN2A knockdown, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. Indeed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A expression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16/CDKN2A knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16 expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis in vitro by inducing apoptosis. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16-low tumors as loss of p16 may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.\nCytokine storm mitigation for exogenous immune agonists\nAuthors: Kareva, I.; Gevertz, J. L.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548130\nCytokine storm is a life-threatening inflammatory response characterized by hyperactivation of the immune system. It can be caused by various therapies, auto-immune conditions, or pathogens, such as respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. Here we propose a conceptual mathematical model describing the phenomenology of cytokine-immune interactions when a tumor is treated by an exogenous immune cell agonist which has the potential to cause a cytokine storm, such as CAR T cell therapy. Numerical simulations reveal that as a function of just two model parameters, the same drug dose and regimen could result in one of four outcomes: treatment success without a storm, treatment success with a storm, treatment failure without a storm, and treatment failure with a storm. We then explore a scenario in which tumor control is accompanied by a storm and ask if it is possible to modulate the duration and frequency of drug administration (without changing the cumulative dose) in order to preserve efficacy while preventing the storm. Simulations reveal existence of a \"sweet spot\" in protocol space (number versus spacing of doses) for which tumor control is achieved without inducing a cytokine storm. This theoretical model, which contains a number of parameters that can be estimated experimentally, contributes to our understanding of what triggers a cytokine storm, and how the likelihood of its occurrence can be mitigated.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a versatile enzyme affecting many aspects of cellular physiology. However, it remains unclear which of the cellular processes are most perturbed upon PP2A inhibition and how these perturbations could be exploited therapeutically. We report an unanticipated sensitivity of the splicing machinery to phosphorylation changes in response to PP2A inhibition by LB-100 in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observe enrichment for differentially phosphorylated sites within cancer-critical splicing nodes of U2 snRNP, SRSF and hnRNP proteins. Altered phosphorylation endows LB-100-treated colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with differential splicing patterns. In PP2A-inhibited cells, over 1000 events of exon skipping and intron retention affect regulators of genomic integrity. Finally, LB-100-evoked alternative splicing is predicted to be a source of neoantigens that can improve cancer treatment responses to immune modulators. Our findings provide a potential explanation for the pre-clinical and clinical observations that PP2A inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade and genotoxic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by the activation of EVI1 due to chromosome 3q26/MECOM rearrangements is incurable. Since transcription factors like EVI1 are notoriously hard to target, insight into the mechanism by which EVI1 drives myeloid transformation could provide alternative avenues for therapy. Applying protein folding predictions combined with proteomics technologies we demonstrate interaction with CTBP1 and CTBP2 via a single PLDLS motif in EVI1 is indispensable for leukemic transformation. A 4x PLDLS repeat construct outcompetes binding of EVI1 to CTBP1 and CTBP2 and inhibits proliferation of 3q26/MECOM rearranged AML in vitro and in xenotransplant models. This proof-of-concept study opens the possibility to target one of the most incurable forms of AML with specific EVI1-CTBP inhibitors. Our findings may also have important implications for other tumour types with aberrant expression of EVI1 or for cancers transformed by other CTBP1/2 dependent oncogenic transcription factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Senescent cells accumulate in multiple age-related disorders, including cancer, exacerbating the pathological manifestations, and the eradication of these cells has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Despite the impact of senescence in diseases, the development of tools to monitor the senescent burden in vivo remains a challenge due to their suboptimal specificity, translatability, and tissue penetrance. Here, we have designed a nanostructured organic probe (NanoJaggs) based on biocompatible indocyanine green dye (ICG) building blocks forming J-aggregates, which possess distinct spectral properties allowing both fluorescence and photoacoustic tomography (PAT) detection. We show that NanoJaggs are taken up by an active process of endocytosis and exhibit selective accumulation at the lysosomal compartment in several in vitro models for senescence. Finally, NanoJagg probe is validated in two in vivo studies including live PAT imaging and shows remarkable specificity to tumours with chemotherapy-induced senescence compared to untreated proliferative tumors. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable tool for detection of senescence and their robust PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescent burden in solid tumors after chemo or radiotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions occur frequently in human epithelia and can remodel almost entire tissues, the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing, guide capture and spatial transcriptomics to longitudinally monitor cell type-specific clonal expansions, document their underlying gene programs and contrast clonal expansions from tumor initiation. We uncover a TNF- signaling module that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF- signaling module is downregulated, and instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF- gene program. By analyzing clonally expanded perturbations and their frequency in tumors, we demonstrate that the autocrine TNF- gene program is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is preexistent in a subpopulation of expanded epidermal stem cells, contributing to the predisposition for tumor initiation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the epithelial TNF- gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties of epidermal stem cells and show that the TNF- signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues and unveils distinct TNF- programs in tumor evolution. Understanding the biology of clonal expansions in phenotypically normal epithelia and the mechanisms governing their transformation will guide the development of novel strategies for early cancer detection and therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Hypoxic regions are associated with a unique histology of pseudopalisading cells, while other regions appear to have limited histological organization, reflecting the diffuse nature of glioma cells. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics with spatial proteomics and novel computational approaches to define glioma cellular states at high granularity and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of cellular organization. First, cells in any given state tend to be spatially clustered, such that tumors are composed of small local environments that are each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. Despite the unique composition of each tumor, this pairing of states remains largely consistent across tumors. Third, the pairwise interactions that we detect collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive this 5-layered organization, as it is both associated with unique states of surrounding cells and with a long-range organization that extends from the hypoxic core to the infiltrative edge of the tumor. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of gliomas at the resolution of cellular states and highlight the role of hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multi-region DNA sequencing of primary tumors and metastases from individual patients helps identify somatic aberrations driving cancer development. However, most methods to infer copy-number aberrations (CNAs) analyze individual samples. We introduce HATCHet2 to identify haplotype- and clone-specific CNAs simultaneously from multiple bulk samples. HATCHet2 introduces a novel statistic, the mirrored haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), to identify mirrored-subclonal CNAs having different numbers of copies of parental haplotypes in different tumor clones. HATCHet2 also has high accuracy in identifying focal CNAs and extends the earlier HATCHet method in several directions. We demonstrate HATCHet2s improved accuracy using simulations and a single-cell sequencing dataset. HATCHet2 analysis of 50 prostate cancer samples from 10 patients reveals previously-unreported mirrored-subclonal CNAs affecting cancer genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While cancer is an age-related disease, many cancer studies utilize younger animal models. Here, we uncover how a cancer, B-cell lymphoma, develops as a consequence of a naturally aged system. We show that this malignancy is associated with increased cell size, splenomegaly, and a newly discovered age-associated clonal B-cell (ACBC) population. Driven by exogenous c-Myc activation, hypermethylated promoters and somatic mutations, ACBC cells clonally expand independent of germinal centers (IgM&#43;) and show increased biological age and hypomethylation in partially methylated domains related to mitotic solo-CpGs. Epigenetic changes in transformed mouse B cells are enriched for changes observed in human B-cell lymphomas. Mechanistically, the data suggest that cancerous ACBC cells originate from age-associated B cells, in part involving CD22 protein signaling fostered by the aging microenvironment. Transplantation assays demonstrate that ACBC evolve to become self-sufficient and support malignancy when transferred into young recipients. Inhibition of mTOR or c-Myc in old mice attenuates premalignant changes in B cells during aging and emerges as a therapeutic strategy to delay the onset of age-related lymphoma. Together, we show how aging contributes to B-cell lymphoma through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving cell-intrinsic changes and the aged microenvironment, characterize a model that captures the origin and progression of spontaneous cancer during aging and identify candidate interventions against age-associated lymphoma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a familial disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) mutations that promote gastrointestinal polyposis and enhance cancer susceptibility. How LKB1-deficiency alters the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues to mediate increased cancer risk remains poorly understood. Here, we employ small intestinal organoids to investigate these issues for heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1 epithelial loss. We show that Lkb1 loss causes an allele dosage-dependent activation of a transcriptional program for tissue repair that is already induced in stem cell populations and mediates alterations in secretory cell type morphology and positioning. Furthermore, this shift towards a regenerative state omits the need for EGF supplementation, thus inducing niche-independent properties. Strikingly, we uncover that heterozygous loss of Lkb1 is sufficient to push the epithelium into a premalignant program for colorectal carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or Kras mutations. We conclude that persistent upregulation of a regenerative program due to LKB1 loss alters cellular hierarchy and induces niche independency, which predisposes PJS epithelium to uncontrolled growth along the serrated pathway.</p>

        <p class="abstract">p16 is a tumor suppressor encoded by the CDKN2A gene whose expression is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. In its canonical role, p16 inhibits the G1-S phase cell cycle progression through suppression of cyclin dependent kinases. Interestingly, p16 also has roles in metabol-ic reprogramming, and we previously published that loss of p16 promotes nucleotide synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Whether other nucleotide metabolic genes and pathways are affected by p16/CDKN2A loss and if these can be specifically targeted in p16-low tumors has not been previously explored. Using CRISPR KO libraries in multiple isogenic melanoma cell lines with wildtype p16/CDKN2A and p16/CDKN2A knockdown, we determined that many nucleotide metabolism genes are negatively enriched in p16/CDKN2A knockdown cells compared to controls. Indeed, many of the genes that are required for survival in the context of low p16/CDKN2A expression based on our CRISPR screens are upregulated in p16/CDKN2A knockdown melanoma cells and those with endogenously low CDKN2A expression. We determined that cells with low p16 expression are sensitive to multiple inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis in vitro by inducing apoptosis. Together, our data provide evidence to reevaluate the utility of these drugs in patients with p16-low tumors as loss of p16 may provide a therapeutic window for these agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytokine storm is a life-threatening inflammatory response characterized by hyperactivation of the immune system. It can be caused by various therapies, auto-immune conditions, or pathogens, such as respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. Here we propose a conceptual mathematical model describing the phenomenology of cytokine-immune interactions when a tumor is treated by an exogenous immune cell agonist which has the potential to cause a cytokine storm, such as CAR T cell therapy. Numerical simulations reveal that as a function of just two model parameters, the same drug dose and regimen could result in one of four outcomes: treatment success without a storm, treatment success with a storm, treatment failure without a storm, and treatment failure with a storm. We then explore a scenario in which tumor control is accompanied by a storm and ask if it is possible to modulate the duration and frequency of drug administration (without changing the cumulative dose) in order to preserve efficacy while preventing the storm. Simulations reveal existence of a &#34;sweet spot&#34; in protocol space (number versus spacing of doses) for which tumor control is achieved without inducing a cytokine storm. This theoretical model, which contains a number of parameters that can be estimated experimentally, contributes to our understanding of what triggers a cytokine storm, and how the likelihood of its occurrence can be mitigated.</p>
