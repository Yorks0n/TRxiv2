R.; Jenkins, R.; Colliver, E.; Zhang, H.; Novo, D.; Moore, D.; Ramsden, Z.; Rullan, A.; Fu, X.; Yuan, Y.; Harrington, H. A.; Swanton, C.; Byrne, H. M.; Sahai, E.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574362\nExtracellular matrix (ECM) organization influences cancer development and progression. It modulates the invasion of cancer cells and can hinder the access of immune cells to cancer cells. Effective quantification of ECM architecture and its relationship to the position of different cell types is, therefore, important when investigating the role of ECM in cancer development. Using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly persistent homology and Dowker persistent homology, we develop a novel analysis pipeline for quantifying ECM architecture, spatial patterns of cell positions, and the spatial relationships between distinct constituents of the tumour microenvironment. We apply the pipeline to 44 surgical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from the lung TRACERx study stained with picrosirius red and haematoxylin. We show that persistent homology effectively encodes the architectural features of the tumour microenvironment. Inference using pseudo-time analysis and spatial mapping to centimetre scale tissues suggests a gradual and progressive route of change in ECM architecture, with two different end states. Dowker persistent homology enables the analysis of spatial relationship between any pair of constituents of the tumour microenvironment, such as ECM, cancer cells, and leukocytes. We use Dowker persistent homology to quantify the spatial segregation of cancer and immune cells over different length scales. A combined analysis of both topological and non-topological features of the tumour microenvironment indicates that progressive changes in the ECM are linked to increased immune exclusion and reduced oxidative metabolism.\nDirect excitatory synapses between neurons and tumor cells drive brain metastatic seeding of breast cancer and melanoma\nAuthors: Venkataramani, V.; Karreman, M. A.; Nguyen, L. C.; Tehranian, C.; Hebach, N.; Mayer, C.; Meyer, L.; Mughal, S.; Reifenberger, G.; Felsberg, J.; Koehrer, K.; Schubert, M. C.; Westphal, D.; Breckwolt, M.; Brors, B.; Wick, W.; Kuner, T.; Winkler, F.\nScore: 149.1, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574608\nInteractions between neurons and cancer cells are found in many malignancies, but their relevance for metastatic organ colonization remain largely unknown. It is also unclear whether any direct synaptic communication between neurons and cancer cells of non-neural tumor types exists, and if so, whether this can support metastasis and thus cancer progression. Here we show that excitatory synapses are formed between neurons and brain-metastatic melanoma and breast cancer cells. This starts at an early microscopic stage after extravasation into the brain parenchyma, during residence of cancer cells in the perivascular niche, a critical step for their survival. These neuron-cancer synapses showed a bona fide synaptic ultrastructure, and generated excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype in cancer cells. In accordance, AMPA receptor signatures were consistently detected in preclinical and patient samples of melanoma and breast cancer brain metastases. Genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of AMPA receptors with the approved antiepileptic drug perampanel in models of breast and melanoma cancer reduced the number of brain metastases and overall brain metastatic burden. These findings demonstrate for the first time that neurons can form biologically relevant direct synapses with non-neural cancer cells. In brain metastasis, a particularly challenging complication of many common malignancies, this non-canonical stimulatory synaptic interaction offers novel therapeutic opportunities.\nCombining RASG12C(ON) inhibitor with SHP2 inhibition sensitises immune excluded lung tumours to immune checkpoint blockade: a strategy for turning cold tumours hot\nAuthors: Anastasiou, P.; Moore, C.; Rana, S.; de Castro, A.; Tomaschko, M.; Boumelha, J.; Mugarza, E.; Blaj, C.; de Carne Trecesson, S.; Goldstone, R.; Smith, J.; Quintana, E.; Molina-Arcas, M.; Downward, J.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575765\nMutant selective drugs targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form of KRASG12C have been approved for use in lung cancer, but responses are short-lived due to rapid development of resistance. In this study we use a novel covalent tri-complex inhibitor, RMC-4998, that targets RASG12C in its active, GTP-bound form to investigate treatment of KRAS mutant lung cancer in various immune competent mouse models. While this RASG12C(ON) inhibitor was more potent than the KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitor adagrasib, rapid pathway reactivation was still observed. This could be delayed using combined treatment with a SHP2 inhibitor, RMC-4550, which not only impacted RAS pathway signalling within the tumour cells but also remodelled the tumour microenvironment (TME) to be less immunosuppressive and promoted interferon responses. In an inflamed, \"hot\", mouse model of lung cancer, RASG12C(ON) and SHP2 inhibitors in combination drive durable responses by suppressing tumour relapse and inducing development of immune memory, which can also be induced by combination of RASG12C(ON) and PD-1 inhibitors. In contrast, in an immune excluded, \"cold\", mouse model of lung cancer, combined RASG12C(ON) and SHP2 inhibition does not cause durable responses, but does sensitise tumours to immune checkpoint blockade, enabling efficient tumour rejection, accompanied by significant TME reorganization, including depletion of immunosuppressive innate immune cells and recruitment and activation of T and NK cells. These preclinical results demonstrate the potential of the combination of RASG12C(ON) inhibitors with SHP2 inhibitors to sensitize anti-PD-1 refractory tumours to immune checkpoint blockade by stimulating anti-tumour immunity as well as by targeting KRAS-driven proliferation in tumour cells.\nDivergent trajectories to structural diversity impact patient survival in high grade serous ovarian cancer\nAuthors: Ewing, A.; Meynert, A.; Silk, R.; Aitken, S.; Bendixsen, D.

C.; McNeish, I. A.; Biankin, A. V.; Roxburgh, P.; Gourley, C.; Semple, C. A.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575376\nDeciphering the structural variation across tumour genomes is crucial to determine the events driving tumour progression and better understand tumour adaptation and evolution. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an exemplar tumour type showing extreme, but poorly characterised structural diversity. We comprehensively describe the mutational landscape driving HGSOC, exploiting a large (N=324), deeply whole genome sequenced dataset. We reveal two divergent evolutionary trajectories, affecting patient survival and involving differing genomic environments. One involves homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) while the other is dominated by whole genome duplication (WGD) with frequent chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridges and extra-chromosomal DNA. These trajectories contribute to structural variation hotspots, containing novel candidate driver genes with significantly altered expression. While structural variation predominantly drives tumorigenesis, we also find high mtDNA mutation loads associated with shorter patient survival, and acting in combination with alterations in the nuclear genome to impact prognosis and suggesting new strategies for patient stratification.\nPCTA, A PAN-CANCER CELL LINE TRANSCRIPTOME ATLAS\nAuthors: Cheng, S.; Li, L.; Yu, X.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575087\nBackgroundA substantial volume of RNA sequencing data were generated from cancer cell lines. However, it requires specific bioinformatics skills to compare gene expression levels across cell lines. This has hindered non-bioinformaticians from fully utilizing these valuable datasets in their research. To bridge this gap, we established a curated Pan-cancer Cell Line Transcriptome Atlas (PCTA) dataset. This resource aims to provide a user-friendly platform, allowing researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise to access and leverage the wealth of information within the dataset for their studies. Importantly, PCTA stands out by offering sufficient sample numbers per cell line in comparison to other pan-cancer datasets. MethodsCell lines meta data and RNA sequencing data were retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), SRA and ARCHS4 databases. Utilizing the programming language R, we conducted data retrieval, normalization, and visualization. Only expression data for protein-coding genes and long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were considered in this study, streamlining the focus to enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis. ResultsThe resulting PCTA dataset encompasses the expression matrix of 24,965 genes, featuring data from 84,385 samples derived from 5,677 studies. This comprehensive compilation spans 535 cell lines, representing a spectrum of 114 cancer types originating from 30 diverse tissue types. On UMAP plots, cell lines originating from the same type of tissue tend to cluster together, illustrating the datasets ability to capture biological relationships. To unravel molecular signatures, marker genes were identified for each cancer type. Additionally, an interactive and user-friendly web application (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/PCTA_app/) was developed for researchers to explore the PCTA dataset. This platform allows users to examine the expression pattern of their genes of interest across a diverse array of samples. Data are visualized as violin-, box-, and point-plots, enhancing the interpretability of the findings. ConclusionThe PCTA stands as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into gene expression patterns across diverse cancer cell lines and providing a valuable tool to explore molecular signatures and potential therapeutic targets in cancer research.\nInternalisation of integrin-bound extracellular matrix modulates invasive carcinoma cell migration\nAuthors: Llanses Martinez, M.; Nan, K.; Bao, Z.; Bacchetti, R.; Yuan, S.; Tyler, J.; Le Guezennec, X.; Bard, F. A.; Rainero, E.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575153\nThe interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. Here we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38{beta}), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound 2{beta}1 integrin. Furthermore, 2{beta}1 integrin was necessary for macropinocytosis of soluble dextran, identifying it as a novel and targetable regulator of macropinocytosis in cancer. Moreover, disruption of 2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11 and PP2R1A-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Finally, 2{beta}1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly upregulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A and 2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the 2{beta}1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression.\nPulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) reduces the tumor-promoting responses induced by conventional chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts\nAuthors: Franco-Barraza, J.; Luong, T.; Wong, J. K.; Raghavan, K.; Handroff, E.; Vendramini-Costa, D. B.; Francescone, R.; Gardiner, J. C.; Meyer, J. E.; Cukierman, E.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575510\nPancreatic cancer is becoming increasingly deadly, with treatment options limited due to, among others, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This short communications study investigates pulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) as a potential alternative to conventional radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer neoadjuvant treatment. Our ex vivo research demonstrates that PLDR, in combination with chemotherapy, promotes a shift from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing properties in a key component of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment we called CAFu (cancer-associated fibroblasts and selfgenerated extracellular matrix functional units). This beneficial effect translates to reduced desmoplasia (fibrous tumor expansion) and suggests PLDRs potential to improve total neoadjuvant therapy effectiveness. To comprehensively assess this functional shift, we developed the HOST-Factor, a single score integrating multiple biomarkers. This tool provides a more accurate picture of CAFu function compared to individual biomarkers and could be valuable for guiding and monitoring future therapeutic strategies. Our findings support the ongoing NCT04452357 clinical trial testing PLDR safety and TME normalization potential in pancreatic cancer patients. The HOST-Factor will be used in samples collected from this trial to validate its potential as a key tool for personalized medicine in this aggressive disease.\nUtilizing a dual endogenous reporter system to identify functional regulators of aberrant stem cell and differentiation activity in colorectal cancer\nAuthors: Spisak, S.; Chen, D.; Likasitwatanakul, P.; Doan, P.; Li, Z.; Bala, P.; Vizkeleti, L.; De Silva, P.; Giannakis, M.; Wolpin, B.; Qi, J.; Sethi, N.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545895\nAberrant stem cell-like activity and impaired differentiation are central to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). To identify functional mediators that regulate these key cellular programs in CRC, we developed an endogenous reporter system by genome-editing human CRC cell lines with knock-in fluorescent reporters at the SOX9 and KRT20 locus to report aberrant stem cell-like activity and differentiation, respectively, and then performed pooled genetic perturbation screens. Constructing a dual reporter system that simultaneously monitored aberrant stem cell-like and differentiation activity in the same CRC cell line improved our signal to noise discrimination. Using a focused-library CRISPR screen targeting 78 epigenetic regulators with 542 sgRNAs, we identified factors that contribute to stem cell-like activity and differentiation in CRC. Perturbation single cell RNA sequencing (Perturb-seq) of validated hits nominated SMARCB1 of the BAF complex (also known as SWI/SNF) as a negative regulator of differentiation across an array of neoplastic colon models. SMARCB1 is a dependency in CRC and required for in vivo growth of human CRC models. These studies highlight the utility of a biologically designed endogenous reporter system to uncover novel therapeutic targets for drug development.\nCharacterization of a novel humanized heavy chain antibody targeting endogenous retroviruses with anti-lymphoma activity\nAuthors: Spriano, F.; Cascione, L.; Sgrignani, J.; Bendik, N.; Napoli, S.; Sartori, G.; Cannas, E.; Gong, T.; Arribas, A. J.; Pizzi, M.; Rossi, D.; Robbiani, D. F.; Cavalli, A.; Bertoni, F.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576027\nLymphomas continue to pose therapeutic challenges, with a considerable portion of patients facing refractory disease. This study focuses on Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent lymphoma type. Within the human genome, transposable elements (TEs), particularly Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), constitute a significant yet understudied portion. Among HERVs, the HERV-K family, specifically HERV-K113 and HERV-K115, has intact open reading frames. Epigenetic regulation tightly controls HERV expression, and aberrant expression has been observed in various cancers, including lymphomas. This research investigates the potential of HERV-K as a therapeutic target in DLBCL. The study encompasses comprehensive methods, including RNA extraction, PCR detection, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, peptide prediction, phage display, surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, internalization assays, and bioinformatic analysis. Results reveal the presence and expression of HERVs in lymphoma patients and cell lines, with the HERV-K envelope protein identified as a crucial contributor to lymphoma cell growth. Moreover, the study identifies immunogenic regions of HERV-K, leading to the development of a humanized camelid nanobody (FF-01) with potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis differentiates DLBCL subgroups based on TE expression, providing insights into prognostic variations. Patients with high HERV-K113 expression show activation of pathways related to antiviral responses, suggesting a viral mimicry state. In conclusion, the study highlights the clinical relevance of HERVs in lymphomas, proposing them as novel therapeutic targets. The newly developed nanobody FF-01 demonstrates anti-lymphoma activity through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and internalization. This research opens avenues for exploring endogenous retroviruses as targets for immunotherapy in lymphomas, showcasing the potential of FF-01 as a promising candidate for further investigation.\nCell polarity proteins promote macropinocytosis in response to metabolic stress\nAuthors: Lambies, G.; Lee, S.-W.; Duong-Polk, K.; Aza-Blanc, P.; Maganti, S.; Dawson, D. W.; Commisso, C.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575943\nMacropinocytosis has emerged as a nutrient-scavenging pathway that cancer cells exploit to survive the nutrient-deprived conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells are especially reliant on glutamine for their survival, and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, glutamine deficiency can enhance the stimulation of macropinocytosis, allowing the cells to escape metabolic stress through the production of extracellular-protein-derived amino acids. Here, we identify the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) enzymes, PKC{zeta} and PKC{iota} as novel regulators of macropinocytosis. In normal epithelial cells, aPKCs are known to regulate cell polarity in association with the scaffold proteins Par3 and Par6, controlling the function of several targets, including the Par1 kinases. In PDAC cells, we identify that each of these cell polarity proteins are required for glutamine stress-induced macropinocytosis. Mechanistically, we find that the aPKCs are regulated by EGFR signaling or by the transcription factor CREM to promote the relocation of Par3 to microtubules, facilitating macropinocytosis in a dynein-dependent manner. Importantly, we determine that cell fitness impairment caused by aPKC depletion is rescued by the restoration of macropinocytosis and that aPKCs support PDAC growth in vivo. These results identify a previously unappreciated role for cell polarity proteins in the regulation of macropinocytosis and provide a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings that control macropinocytic uptake in the context of metabolic stress.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Extracellular matrix (ECM) organization influences cancer development and progression. It modulates the invasion of cancer cells and can hinder the access of immune cells to cancer cells. Effective quantification of ECM architecture and its relationship to the position of different cell types is, therefore, important when investigating the role of ECM in cancer development. Using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly persistent homology and Dowker persistent homology, we develop a novel analysis pipeline for quantifying ECM architecture, spatial patterns of cell positions, and the spatial relationships between distinct constituents of the tumour microenvironment. We apply the pipeline to 44 surgical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from the lung TRACERx study stained with picrosirius red and haematoxylin. We show that persistent homology effectively encodes the architectural features of the tumour microenvironment. Inference using pseudo-time analysis and spatial mapping to centimetre scale tissues suggests a gradual and progressive route of change in ECM architecture, with two different end states. Dowker persistent homology enables the analysis of spatial relationship between any pair of constituents of the tumour microenvironment, such as ECM, cancer cells, and leukocytes. We use Dowker persistent homology to quantify the spatial segregation of cancer and immune cells over different length scales. A combined analysis of both topological and non-topological features of the tumour microenvironment indicates that progressive changes in the ECM are linked to increased immune exclusion and reduced oxidative metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interactions between neurons and cancer cells are found in many malignancies, but their relevance for metastatic organ colonization remain largely unknown. It is also unclear whether any direct synaptic communication between neurons and cancer cells of non-neural tumor types exists, and if so, whether this can support metastasis and thus cancer progression. Here we show that excitatory synapses are formed between neurons and brain-metastatic melanoma and breast cancer cells. This starts at an early microscopic stage after extravasation into the brain parenchyma, during residence of cancer cells in the perivascular niche, a critical step for their survival. These neuron-cancer synapses showed a bona fide synaptic ultrastructure, and generated excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype in cancer cells. In accordance, AMPA receptor signatures were consistently detected in preclinical and patient samples of melanoma and breast cancer brain metastases. Genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of AMPA receptors with the approved antiepileptic drug perampanel in models of breast and melanoma cancer reduced the number of brain metastases and overall brain metastatic burden. These findings demonstrate for the first time that neurons can form biologically relevant direct synapses with non-neural cancer cells. In brain metastasis, a particularly challenging complication of many common malignancies, this non-canonical stimulatory synaptic interaction offers novel therapeutic opportunities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutant selective drugs targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form of KRASG12C have been approved for use in lung cancer, but responses are short-lived due to rapid development of resistance. In this study we use a novel covalent tri-complex inhibitor, RMC-4998, that targets RASG12C in its active, GTP-bound form to investigate treatment of KRAS mutant lung cancer in various immune competent mouse models. While this RASG12C(ON) inhibitor was more potent than the KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitor adagrasib, rapid pathway reactivation was still observed. This could be delayed using combined treatment with a SHP2 inhibitor, RMC-4550, which not only impacted RAS pathway signalling within the tumour cells but also remodelled the tumour microenvironment (TME) to be less immunosuppressive and promoted interferon responses. In an inflamed, &#34;hot&#34;, mouse model of lung cancer, RASG12C(ON) and SHP2 inhibitors in combination drive durable responses by suppressing tumour relapse and inducing development of immune memory, which can also be induced by combination of RASG12C(ON) and PD-1 inhibitors. In contrast, in an immune excluded, &#34;cold&#34;, mouse model of lung cancer, combined RASG12C(ON) and SHP2 inhibition does not cause durable responses, but does sensitise tumours to immune checkpoint blockade, enabling efficient tumour rejection, accompanied by significant TME reorganization, including depletion of immunosuppressive innate immune cells and recruitment and activation of T and NK cells. These preclinical results demonstrate the potential of the combination of RASG12C(ON) inhibitors with SHP2 inhibitors to sensitize anti-PD-1 refractory tumours to immune checkpoint blockade by stimulating anti-tumour immunity as well as by targeting KRAS-driven proliferation in tumour cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deciphering the structural variation across tumour genomes is crucial to determine the events driving tumour progression and better understand tumour adaptation and evolution. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an exemplar tumour type showing extreme, but poorly characterised structural diversity. We comprehensively describe the mutational landscape driving HGSOC, exploiting a large (N=324), deeply whole genome sequenced dataset. We reveal two divergent evolutionary trajectories, affecting patient survival and involving differing genomic environments. One involves homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) while the other is dominated by whole genome duplication (WGD) with frequent chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridges and extra-chromosomal DNA. These trajectories contribute to structural variation hotspots, containing novel candidate driver genes with significantly altered expression. While structural variation predominantly drives tumorigenesis, we also find high mtDNA mutation loads associated with shorter patient survival, and acting in combination with alterations in the nuclear genome to impact prognosis and suggesting new strategies for patient stratification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA substantial volume of RNA sequencing data were generated from cancer cell lines. However, it requires specific bioinformatics skills to compare gene expression levels across cell lines. This has hindered non-bioinformaticians from fully utilizing these valuable datasets in their research. To bridge this gap, we established a curated Pan-cancer Cell Line Transcriptome Atlas (PCTA) dataset. This resource aims to provide a user-friendly platform, allowing researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise to access and leverage the wealth of information within the dataset for their studies. Importantly, PCTA stands out by offering sufficient sample numbers per cell line in comparison to other pan-cancer datasets.

MethodsCell lines meta data and RNA sequencing data were retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), SRA and ARCHS4 databases. Utilizing the programming language R, we conducted data retrieval, normalization, and visualization. Only expression data for protein-coding genes and long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were considered in this study, streamlining the focus to enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis.

ResultsThe resulting PCTA dataset encompasses the expression matrix of 24,965 genes, featuring data from 84,385 samples derived from 5,677 studies. This comprehensive compilation spans 535 cell lines, representing a spectrum of 114 cancer types originating from 30 diverse tissue types. On UMAP plots, cell lines originating from the same type of tissue tend to cluster together, illustrating the datasets ability to capture biological relationships. To unravel molecular signatures, marker genes were identified for each cancer type. Additionally, an interactive and user-friendly web application (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/PCTA_app/) was developed for researchers to explore the PCTA dataset. This platform allows users to examine the expression pattern of their genes of interest across a diverse array of samples. Data are visualized as violin-, box-, and point-plots, enhancing the interpretability of the findings.

ConclusionThe PCTA stands as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into gene expression patterns across diverse cancer cell lines and providing a valuable tool to explore molecular signatures and potential therapeutic targets in cancer research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. Here we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38{beta}), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound 2{beta}1 integrin. Furthermore, 2{beta}1 integrin was necessary for macropinocytosis of soluble dextran, identifying it as a novel and targetable regulator of macropinocytosis in cancer. Moreover, disruption of 2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11 and PP2R1A-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Finally, 2{beta}1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly upregulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A and 2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the 2{beta}1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic cancer is becoming increasingly deadly, with treatment options limited due to, among others, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This short communications study investigates pulsed low-dose-rate radiation (PLDR) as a potential alternative to conventional radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer neoadjuvant treatment.

Our ex vivo research demonstrates that PLDR, in combination with chemotherapy, promotes a shift from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing properties in a key component of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment we called CAFu (cancer-associated fibroblasts and selfgenerated extracellular matrix functional units). This beneficial effect translates to reduced desmoplasia (fibrous tumor expansion) and suggests PLDRs potential to improve total neoadjuvant therapy effectiveness.

To comprehensively assess this functional shift, we developed the HOST-Factor, a single score integrating multiple biomarkers. This tool provides a more accurate picture of CAFu function compared to individual biomarkers and could be valuable for guiding and monitoring future therapeutic strategies.

Our findings support the ongoing NCT04452357 clinical trial testing PLDR safety and TME normalization potential in pancreatic cancer patients. The HOST-Factor will be used in samples collected from this trial to validate its potential as a key tool for personalized medicine in this aggressive disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant stem cell-like activity and impaired differentiation are central to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). To identify functional mediators that regulate these key cellular programs in CRC, we developed an endogenous reporter system by genome-editing human CRC cell lines with knock-in fluorescent reporters at the SOX9 and KRT20 locus to report aberrant stem cell-like activity and differentiation, respectively, and then performed pooled genetic perturbation screens. Constructing a dual reporter system that simultaneously monitored aberrant stem cell-like and differentiation activity in the same CRC cell line improved our signal to noise discrimination. Using a focused-library CRISPR screen targeting 78 epigenetic regulators with 542 sgRNAs, we identified factors that contribute to stem cell-like activity and differentiation in CRC. Perturbation single cell RNA sequencing (Perturb-seq) of validated hits nominated SMARCB1 of the BAF complex (also known as SWI/SNF) as a negative regulator of differentiation across an array of neoplastic colon models. SMARCB1 is a dependency in CRC and required for in vivo growth of human CRC models. These studies highlight the utility of a biologically designed endogenous reporter system to uncover novel therapeutic targets for drug development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lymphomas continue to pose therapeutic challenges, with a considerable portion of patients facing refractory disease. This study focuses on Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent lymphoma type. Within the human genome, transposable elements (TEs), particularly Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), constitute a significant yet understudied portion. Among HERVs, the HERV-K family, specifically HERV-K113 and HERV-K115, has intact open reading frames. Epigenetic regulation tightly controls HERV expression, and aberrant expression has been observed in various cancers, including lymphomas. This research investigates the potential of HERV-K as a therapeutic target in DLBCL. The study encompasses comprehensive methods, including RNA extraction, PCR detection, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, peptide prediction, phage display, surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, internalization assays, and bioinformatic analysis. Results reveal the presence and expression of HERVs in lymphoma patients and cell lines, with the HERV-K envelope protein identified as a crucial contributor to lymphoma cell growth. Moreover, the study identifies immunogenic regions of HERV-K, leading to the development of a humanized camelid nanobody (FF-01) with potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis differentiates DLBCL subgroups based on TE expression, providing insights into prognostic variations. Patients with high HERV-K113 expression show activation of pathways related to antiviral responses, suggesting a viral mimicry state. In conclusion, the study highlights the clinical relevance of HERVs in lymphomas, proposing them as novel therapeutic targets. The newly developed nanobody FF-01 demonstrates anti-lymphoma activity through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and internalization. This research opens avenues for exploring endogenous retroviruses as targets for immunotherapy in lymphomas, showcasing the potential of FF-01 as a promising candidate for further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Macropinocytosis has emerged as a nutrient-scavenging pathway that cancer cells exploit to survive the nutrient-deprived conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells are especially reliant on glutamine for their survival, and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, glutamine deficiency can enhance the stimulation of macropinocytosis, allowing the cells to escape metabolic stress through the production of extracellular-protein-derived amino acids. Here, we identify the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) enzymes, PKC{zeta} and PKC{iota} as novel regulators of macropinocytosis. In normal epithelial cells, aPKCs are known to regulate cell polarity in association with the scaffold proteins Par3 and Par6, controlling the function of several targets, including the Par1 kinases. In PDAC cells, we identify that each of these cell polarity proteins are required for glutamine stress-induced macropinocytosis. Mechanistically, we find that the aPKCs are regulated by EGFR signaling or by the transcription factor CREM to promote the relocation of Par3 to microtubules, facilitating macropinocytosis in a dynein-dependent manner. Importantly, we determine that cell fitness impairment caused by aPKC depletion is rescued by the restoration of macropinocytosis and that aPKCs support PDAC growth in vivo. These results identify a previously unappreciated role for cell polarity proteins in the regulation of macropinocytosis and provide a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings that control macropinocytic uptake in the context of metabolic stress.</p>
