W.; House, T.; Walker, A. S.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296866\nBackgroundSyndromic surveillance often relies on patients presenting to healthcare. Community cohorts, although more challenging to recruit, could provide additional population-wide insights, particularly with SARS-CoV-2 co-circulating with other respiratory viruses. MethodsWe estimated positivity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and RSV, and trends in self-reported symptoms including influenza-like illness (ILI), over the 2022/23 winter season in a broadly representative UK community cohort (COVID-19 Infection Survey), using negative-binomial generalised additive models. We estimated associations between test positivity and each of symptoms and influenza vaccination, using adjusted logistic and multinomial models. FindingsSwabs taken at 32,937/1,352,979 (2.4%) assessments tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 181/14,939 (1.2%) for RSV and 130/14,939 (0.9%) for influenza A/B, varying by age over time. Positivity and incidence peaks were earliest for RSV, then influenza A/B, then SARS-CoV-2, and were highest for RSV in the youngest and for SARS-CoV-2 in the oldest age-groups. Many test-positives did not report key symptoms: middle-aged participants were generally more symptomatic than older or younger participants, but still only [~]25% reported ILI-WHO and [~]60% ILI-ECDC. Most symptomatic participants did not test positive for any of the three viruses. Influenza A/B-positivity was lower in participants reporting influenza vaccination in the current and previous seasons (odds ratio=0.55 (95% CI 0.32,0.95)) versus neither season. InterpretationSymptom profiles varied little by aetiology, making distinguishing SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV using symptoms challenging. Most symptoms were not explained by these viruses, indicating the importance of other pathogens in syndromic surveillance. Influenza vaccination was associated with lower rates of community influenza test positivity.

T.; Baird, T.; Goddard, J.; Olagoke, O. S.; Burke, A.; Subedi, S.; Davey, T. R.; Anderson, J.; Sarovich, D. S.; Price, E. P.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.23297281\nPleural space infections (PSIs) are common and associated with substantial healthcare cost, morbidity, and mortality. Accurate PSI diagnosis remains challenging due to low culture positivity rates, frequent polymicrobial involvement, and non-specific diagnostic biomarkers. To better understand the comparative diagnostic yield of culture-independent technologies for PSI diagnosis, we prospectively characterised 26 clinically suspected PSIs and 10 control patients with non-infective pleural effusions using shotgun metagenomics, bacterial metataxonomics, quantitative PCR, and conventional culture. We demonstrate that culture-independent molecular techniques have superior sensitivity and negative predictive values for PSI diagnosis compared with conventional culture. Bacterial metataxonomics and metagenomics were both sensitive to the detection of polymicrobial infections, and unveiled microbial heterogeneity. Metagenomics also detected fungi and DNA viruses within pleural fluid. Dominant pathogens in the PSI cohort according to the highest resolution method, metagenomics, included streptococci (S. intermedius, S. pyogenes, S. mitis), Prevotella spp. (P. oris, P. pleuritidis), staphylococci (S. aureus, S. saprophyticus), and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential utility of molecular methods in the accurate diagnosis of PSI, which represents an important step towards improving personalised treatment decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship in suspected PSI.\nRethinking Blood Eosinophils for Assessing ICS Response in COPD: A Post-Hoc Analysis from FLAME.\nAuthors: Mathioudakis, A. G.; Bate, S.; Sivapalan, P.; Jensen, J.-U.; Singh, D.; Vestbo, J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296651\nBackgroundThe varied treatment response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD, and the increased risk of pneumonia necessitate a personalised ICS approach. This is informed by blood eosinophil count (BEC), which predicts ICS treatment response. This post-hoc analysis evaluates the ability of different BEC measurements to predict ICS treatment response. BEC measured either on or off ICS treatment, and BEC change during ICS treatment were investigated. MethodsFLAME, a 52-week, double-blind RCT compared LABA/LAMA versus LABA/ICS. Corticosteroids were prohibited during a 4-week run-in period. We chose patients previously on ICS, thereby allowing pre and post run-in period BEC to represent BEC on and off ICS, respectively. In this post-hoc analysis, we revisited outcome data, exploring how the three BEC biomarkers interacted with treatment response to the ICS containing regimen. ResultsOur study confirms that LABA/LAMA combination is superior, or at least non-inferior, to LABA/ICS in curbing exacerbations for most FLAME participants. Lower BEC off and BEC on ICS and lack of significant BEC suppression during ICS treatment corresponded to superior response to LABA/LAMA in terms of exacerbation rate, time-to-first exacerbation, and time-to-first pneumonia. In a subgroup, including 9% of participants, BEC changed significantly during ICS treatment, and higher BEC on ICS did not predict ICS treatment response. For these patients BEC off ICS and BEC change proved more predictive. ConclusionThis exploratory analysis advocates preferentially using BEC off ICS or BEC change during ICS treatment for guiding ICS treatment decisions. BEC measured on ICS is less predictive of treatment response. What is already known on this topicBlood eosinophil count (BEC) is used to guide the administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for COPD, but they may be suppressed in response to systemic or inhaled corticosteroids. What this study addsThis post-hoc analysis suggests that BEC change during treatment with ICS and this change is associated with treatment response to ICS containing regimens. More specifically, BEC suppression is associated with favourable response to ICS, while unchanged or increased BEC is associated with inferior ICS treatment effect and increased risk of pneumonia. In 9% of participants, BEC changes significantly ([\u0026ge;]200 cells/L) during ICS treatment, and in these patients, BEC on ICS is not reliable in predicting treatment response to ICS, as it appears that some ICS responders may actually have low BEC on ICS and vice versa. How this study might affect research, practice or policyThese findings highlight the potential utility of BEC change during ICS treatment as a predictive biomarker of treatment response to ICS and question the use of BEC on ICS to guide withdrawal of ICS, but need prospective validation.\n",

Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential utility of molecular methods in the accurate diagnosis of PSI, which represents an important step towards improving personalised treatment decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship in suspected PSI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe varied treatment response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD, and the increased risk of pneumonia necessitate a personalised ICS approach. This is informed by blood eosinophil count (BEC), which predicts ICS treatment response. This post-hoc analysis evaluates the ability of different BEC measurements to predict ICS treatment response. BEC measured either on or off ICS treatment, and BEC change during ICS treatment were investigated.

MethodsFLAME, a 52-week, double-blind RCT compared LABA/LAMA versus LABA/ICS. Corticosteroids were prohibited during a 4-week run-in period. We chose patients previously on ICS, thereby allowing pre and post run-in period BEC to represent BEC on and off ICS, respectively. In this post-hoc analysis, we revisited outcome data, exploring how the three BEC biomarkers interacted with treatment response to the ICS containing regimen.

ResultsOur study confirms that LABA/LAMA combination is superior, or at least non-inferior, to LABA/ICS in curbing exacerbations for most FLAME participants. Lower BEC off and BEC on ICS and lack of significant BEC suppression during ICS treatment corresponded to superior response to LABA/LAMA in terms of exacerbation rate, time-to-first exacerbation, and time-to-first pneumonia. In a subgroup, including 9% of participants, BEC changed significantly during ICS treatment, and higher BEC on ICS did not predict ICS treatment response. For these patients BEC off ICS and BEC change proved more predictive.

ConclusionThis exploratory analysis advocates preferentially using BEC off ICS or BEC change during ICS treatment for guiding ICS treatment decisions. BEC measured on ICS is less predictive of treatment response.

What is already known on this topicBlood eosinophil count (BEC) is used to guide the administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for COPD, but they may be suppressed in response to systemic or inhaled corticosteroids.

What this study addsThis post-hoc analysis suggests that BEC change during treatment with ICS and this change is associated with treatment response to ICS containing regimens. More specifically, BEC suppression is associated with favourable response to ICS, while unchanged or increased BEC is associated with inferior ICS treatment effect and increased risk of pneumonia. In 9% of participants, BEC changes significantly ([&amp;ge;]200 cells/L) during ICS treatment, and in these patients, BEC on ICS is not reliable in predicting treatment response to ICS, as it appears that some ICS responders may actually have low BEC on ICS and vice versa.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThese findings highlight the potential utility of BEC change during ICS treatment as a predictive biomarker of treatment response to ICS and question the use of BEC on ICS to guide withdrawal of ICS, but need prospective validation.</p>
