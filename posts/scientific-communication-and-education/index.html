We identified 3,191 EP authors across science excluding Physics and 12,624 EP authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of EP authors in the past, in 2022 the number of EP authors was almost similar in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of EP authors, followed by the USA. However, the largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 were seen in Thailand (19-fold), Saudi Arabia (11.5-fold), Spain (11.5-fold), India (10.2-fold), Italy (6.9-fold), Russia (6.5-fold), Pakistan (5.7-fold), and South Korea (5.2-fold).

EP authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most EP Physics authors had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of EP authors in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with \u003e=5 full papers.

One of the main hurdles in cell visualization is to render the millions of molecules in real time computationally. Here, using a video game engine, we demonstrate the capability of rendering massive biological macromolecules at the atomic level within their native environment. To facilitate the visualization, we also provide tools that help the interactive navigation inside the cells, as well as software that converts protein structures identified using CryoET to a scene that can be explored with the game engine.
