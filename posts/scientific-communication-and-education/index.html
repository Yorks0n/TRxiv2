M.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553701\nPrimarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to \"recipe-driven\" lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure \"micropublications\" has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and master's students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.\nChatGPT applications in Academic Research: A Review of Benefits, Concerns, and Recommendations\nAuthors: AlZaabi, A.; ALamri, A.; Albalushi, H.; Aljabri, R.; AalAbdulsallam, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553688\nBackground ChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers' workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences. Method The search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendations regarding ChatGPT's use in scientific research. Results The majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPT's performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as \"hallucinations.\" Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries. Conclusion ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.\nA framework for decolonising and diversifying biomedical sciences curricula: rediscovery, representation and readiness\nAuthors: Lu, T.; Bashir, Z. I.; Dalceggio, A.; McKinnon, C.; Miles, L.; Mosley, A.; Burton, B. R.; Robson, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553224\nTo date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p\u003c0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this 3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p&lt;0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this  3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.</p>
