Guides and how-to articles help life scientists in preparing informative visualizations in poster format. However, those posters shown at conferences are at present often overloaded with data and text and are poorly designed, which in sum hinder, rather than spark communication. Here, we surveyed life scientists themselves to understand why posters are such a struggle and to shed light on poster preparation from their subjective perspectives. We find that biologist spend on average two entire days preparing one poster, with half of the time devoted to visual design aspects. Most respond that they receive no design or software training and also receive little to no feedback when preparing their visualizations. In conclusion, our data suggests that some training, beyond providing literature, of life scientists in visualization principles and tools would likely improve conference poster quality. In addition, this would also improve other common visuals such as figures and slides, and thus overall benefit the science communication of researchers.\nImproving modelling for epidemic responses: reflections from members of the UK infectious disease modelling community on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Sherratt, K.; Carnegie, A.

The sustained high pressure of a pandemic on responders, such as healthcare workers, can lead to lasting psychological impacts including acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and moral injury, which can impact individual wellbeing and productivity. As members of the infectious disease modelling community, we convened a reflective workshop to understand the professional and personal impacts of response work on our community and to propose recommendations for future epidemic responses. The attendees represented a range of career stages, institutions, and disciplines. This piece was collectively produced by those present at the session based on our collective experiences. Key issues we identified at the workshop were lack of institutional support, insecure contracts, unequal credit and recognition, and mental health impacts. Our recommendations include rewarding impactful work, fostering academia-public health collaboration, decreasing dependence on key individuals by developing teams, increasing transparency in decision-making, and implementing sustainable work practices. Despite limitations in representation, this workshop provided valuable insights into the UK COVID-19 modelling experience and guidance for future public health crises. Recognising and addressing the issues highlighted is crucial, in our view, for ensuring the effectiveness of epidemic response work in the future.\n",
