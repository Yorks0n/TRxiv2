Prestigious journals are thought to pursue a reputation of exclusivity by rejecting large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists' articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of the work that warrants recognition.\nA Quantitative Study of Inappropriate Image Duplication in the Journal Toxicology Reports\nAuthors: David, S.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556099\nInappropriate image duplication is a type of scientific error that can be detected by examining published literature. Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.\nHow prior and p-value heuristics are used when interpreting data\nAuthors: Hermer, E.; Irwin, A. A.; Roche, D. G.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556128\nScientific conclusions are based on the ways that researchers interpret data, a process that is shaped by psychological and cultural factors. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics to interpret data, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test the use of heuristics, we surveyed 623 researchers in biology and asked them to interpret scatterplots that showed ambiguous relationships, altering only the labels on the graphs. Our manipulations tested the use of two heuristics based on major statistical frameworks: (1) the strong prior heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is expected a priori, following Bayesian statistics, and (2) the p-value heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is associated with a small p-value, following null hypothesis statistical testing. Our results show that both the strong prior and p-value heuristics are common. Surprisingly, the strong prior heuristic was more prevalent among inexperienced researchers, whereas its effect was diminished among the most experienced biologists in our survey. By contrast, we find that p-values cause researchers at all levels to report that an ambiguous graph shows a strong result. Together, these results suggest that experience in the sciences may diminish a researchers Bayesian intuitions, while reinforcing the use of p-values as a shortcut for effect size. Reform to data science training in STEM could help reduce researchers reliance on error-prone heuristics. Significance StatementScientific researchers must interpret data and statistical tests to draw conclusions. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test how this occurs, we asked biologists to interpret graphs that showed an ambiguous relationship between two variables, and report whether the relationship was strong, weak, or absent. We altered features of the graph to test whether prior expectations or a statistic called the p-value could influence their interpretations. Our results indicate that both prior expectations and p-values can increase the probability that researchers will report that ambiguous data shows a strong result. These findings suggest that current training and research practices promote the use of error-prone shortcuts in decision-making.\n\"Important enough to show the world\": Using Authentic Research Opportunities and Micropublications to Build Students Science Identities\nAuthors: Rubenstein, L. D.; Woodruff, K. A.; Taylor, A. M.; Olesen, J. B.; Smaldino, P. J.; Rubenstein, E. M.\nScore: 62.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553701\nPrimarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to \"recipe-driven\" lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure \"micropublications\" has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.\nIs N-Hacking Ever OK? A Simulation-based study\nAuthors: Reinagel, P.\nScore: 96.7, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2019.12.12.868489\nAfter an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is \"not quite significant\". Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such \"N-hacking\" is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context.\nGender differences in submission behavior exacerbate publication disparities in elite journals\nAuthors: Basson, I.; Ni, C.; Badia, G.; Tufenkji, N.; Sugimoto, C. R.; Lariviere, V.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554192\nWomen are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior. SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\"\nGraduate student mentorship as a target for diversifying the biological sciences\nAuthors: Debray, R.; Dewald-Wang, E. A.; Ennis, K.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553806\nDespite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers. SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.\nChatGPT applications in Academic Research: A Review of Benefits, Concerns, and Recommendations\nAuthors: AlZaabi, A.; ALamri, A.; Albalushi, H.; Aljabri, R.; AalAbdulsallam, A.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553688\nBackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences. MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research. ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as \"hallucinations.\" Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries. ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.\nA framework for decolonising and diversifying biomedical sciences curricula: rediscovery, representation and readiness\nAuthors: Lu, T.; Bashir, Z. I.; Dalceggio, A.; McKinnon, C.; Miles, L.; Mosley, A.; Burton, B. R.; Robson, A.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553224\nTo date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p\u003c0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this 3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.\nChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review\nAuthors: Verharen, J. P. H.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549552\nThe peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals are thought to pursue a reputation of exclusivity by rejecting large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists&#39; articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of the work that warrants recognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inappropriate image duplication is a type of scientific error that can be detected by examining published literature. Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Scientific conclusions are based on the ways that researchers interpret data, a process that is shaped by psychological and cultural factors. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics to interpret data, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test the use of heuristics, we surveyed 623 researchers in biology and asked them to interpret scatterplots that showed ambiguous relationships, altering only the labels on the graphs. Our manipulations tested the use of two heuristics based on major statistical frameworks: (1) the strong prior heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is expected a priori, following Bayesian statistics, and (2) the p-value heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is associated with a small p-value, following null hypothesis statistical testing. Our results show that both the strong prior and p-value heuristics are common. Surprisingly, the strong prior heuristic was more prevalent among inexperienced researchers, whereas its effect was diminished among the most experienced biologists in our survey. By contrast, we find that p-values cause researchers at all levels to report that an ambiguous graph shows a strong result. Together, these results suggest that experience in the sciences may diminish a researchers Bayesian intuitions, while reinforcing the use of p-values as a shortcut for effect size. Reform to data science training in STEM could help reduce researchers reliance on error-prone heuristics.

Significance StatementScientific researchers must interpret data and statistical tests to draw conclusions. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test how this occurs, we asked biologists to interpret graphs that showed an ambiguous relationship between two variables, and report whether the relationship was strong, weak, or absent. We altered features of the graph to test whether prior expectations or a statistic called the p-value could influence their interpretations. Our results indicate that both prior expectations and p-values can increase the probability that researchers will report that ambiguous data shows a strong result. These findings suggest that current training and research practices promote the use of error-prone shortcuts in decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to &#34;recipe-driven&#34; lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure &#34;micropublications&#34; has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is &#34;not quite significant&#34;. Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such &#34;N-hacking&#34; is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Women are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34; We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior.

SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34;</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers.

SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences.

MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research.

ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as &#34;hallucinations.&#34; Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries.

ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p&lt;0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this  3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.</p>
