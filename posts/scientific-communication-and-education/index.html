While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior. SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\"\nHow do conservationists choose where to publish?\nAuthors: Yoh, N.; Holle, M. J. M.; Willis, J.; Rudd, L. F.; Fraser, I. M.; Verissimo, D.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554591\nPublishing in academic journals helps disseminate scientific research and contributes to a researchers academic career. Conservation is interdisciplinary and, as such, there are a diversity of practitioners, scientists, and others who contribute to the conservation literature. Currently, little is known about how different journal attributes impact an authors choice of where to publish or how they may act as barriers to publishing in conservation-related journals. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine the interplay between seven attributes and assess journal choice between three demographic groups. Across 1038 respondents, we found that each group exhibited different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science.\nAnalytical code sharing practices in biomedical research\nAuthors: Sharma, N. K.; Ayyala, R.; Deshpande, D.; Patel, Y. M.; Munteanu, V.; Ciorba, D.; Fiscutean, A.; Vahed, M.; Sarkar, A.; Guo, R.; Moore, A.; Darci-Maher, N.; Nogoy, N. A.; Abedalthagafi, M. S.; Mangul, S.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551384\nData-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.\nA framework for decolonising and diversifying biomedical sciences curricula: rediscovery, representation and readiness\nAuthors: Lu, T.; Bashir, Z. I.; Dalceggio, A.; McKinnon, C.; Miles, L.; Mosley, A.; Burton, B. R.; Robson, A.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553224\nTo date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p\u003c0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this 3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.\nGraduate student mentorship as a target for diversifying the biological sciences\nAuthors: Debray, R.; Dewald-Wang, E. A.; Ennis, K.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553806\nDespite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers. SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Data-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p&lt;0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this  3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers.

SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.</p>
