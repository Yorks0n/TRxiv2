Extremely productive (EP) authors were defined as those with \u003e60 full papers (articles, reviews, conference papers) published in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 EP authors across science excluding Physics and 12,624 EP authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of EP authors in the past, in 2022 the number of EP authors was almost similar in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of EP authors, followed by the USA. However, the largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 were seen in Thailand (19-fold), Saudi Arabia (11.5-fold), Spain (11.5-fold), India (10.2-fold), Italy (6.9-fold), Russia (6.5-fold), Pakistan (5.7-fold), and South Korea (5.2-fold). Excluding Physics, most EP authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries \u0026 Forestry (14.6-fold), Biology (13-fold), and Mathematics and Statistics (6.1-fold). EP authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most EP Physics authors had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of EP authors in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with \u003e=5 full papers. Extreme productivity has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings.\nHigh Impact: Wikipedia sources and edit history document two decades of the climate change field\nAuthors: Benjakob, O.; Jouveshomme, L.; Collet, M.; Augustoni, A.; Aviram, R.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569362\nSince being founded in 2001, Wikipedia has grown into a trusted source of knowledge online, feeding Google search results and serving as training data for ChatGPT. Understanding the accuracy of its information, the sources behind its articles and their role in the transference of knowledge to the public are becoming increasingly important questions. Meanwhile, climate change has moved to the forefront of scientific and public discourse after years of warnings from the scientific community. Therefore, to understand how it was represented on English Wikipedia, we deployed a mixed-method approach on the article for \"Effects of climate change\" (ECC), its edit history and references, as well as hundreds of associated articles dealing with climate change in different ways. Using automated tools to scrape data from Wikipedia, we saw new articles were created as climatology-related knowledge grew and permeated into other fields, reflecting a growing body of climate research and growing public interest. Our qualitative textual analysis shows how specific descriptions of climatic phenomena became less hypothetical, reflecting the real-world public debate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had a big impact on content and structure, we found using a bibliometric analysis, and what made this possible, we also discovered through a historical analysis, was the impactful work of just a few editors. This research suggests Wikipedias articles documented the real-world events around climate change and its wider acceptance - initially a hypothesis that soon became a regretful reality. Overall, our findings highlight the unique role IPCC reports play in making scientific knowledge about climate change actionable to the public, and underscore Wikipedias ability to facilitate access to research. This work demonstrates Wikipedia can be researched using both computational and qualitative methods to better understand transference of scientific information to the public and the history of contemporary science.\nDevelopment and Outcomes of an International Certificate Program in Science Policy and Advocacy for STEM PhD Students and Postdocs\nAuthors: Bankston, A.; Ralston, A.; Ly, J.; Singh, H.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568726\nScientists must play a significant role in enacting societal change by educating and advising policymakers on relevant policy topics. To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy \u0026 Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020. Over three cohorts, the program was focused on practical skills and concepts, networking, and career development opportunities, and providing pathways for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to learn about and in many cases fully transition into science policy and advocacy roles and careers. Program participants were exposed to many important aspects of what it means to be involved in science policy and advocacy, and many chose to enter the field through subsequent opportunities facilitated by the program training. We sought to reduce a number of barriers to program participation, and additionally provided resources for others to develop similar programs at their university. We believe this training model is innovative and can be recapitulated, and sincerely hope to see more universities create similar programs in the US and internationally in order to serve trainees interested in science policy and advocacy and facilitate their building impactful careers in the field for years to come.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Scientists must play a significant role in enacting societal change by educating and advising policymakers on relevant policy topics. To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy &amp; Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020. Over three cohorts, the program was focused on practical skills and concepts, networking, and career development opportunities, and providing pathways for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to learn about and in many cases fully transition into science policy and advocacy roles and careers. Program participants were exposed to many important aspects of what it means to be involved in science policy and advocacy, and many chose to enter the field through subsequent opportunities facilitated by the program training. We sought to reduce a number of barriers to program participation, and additionally provided resources for others to develop similar programs at their university. We believe this training model is innovative and can be recapitulated, and sincerely hope to see more universities create similar programs in the US and internationally in order to serve trainees interested in science policy and advocacy and facilitate their building impactful careers in the field for years to come.</p>
