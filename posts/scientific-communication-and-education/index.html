Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroe-conomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assesments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO2e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO2e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 {+/-} 0.07 kg CO2e/{euro} and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to -20 % in total emissions (-40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes. Significance statementResearch activities are recently interrogating their contribution to global warming, mainly through the impact of air travel but neglecting the emissions embodied in scientific purchases. However, goods and services used in a research laboratory emit greenhouse gases when they are produced. Here we construct a public and robust database of emission factors to quantify purchases emissions in a laboratory and we use it to assess emissions from a hundred of laboratories in France, from all disciplines. We find that purchases emissions represent half of the of the 6.3 t CO2e/pers per year emitted on average per laboratory. Emissions, however, vary greatly between laboratories and disciplines and an analysis of mitigation strategies shows that decreasing demand may significantly reduce purchases emissions.\nAnalytical code sharing practices in biomedical research\nAuthors: Sharma, N.

S.; Mangul, S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551384\nData-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.\nChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review\nAuthors: Verharen, J. P. H.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549552\nThe peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.\nA Hypothesis-Based Hop Microbiology Laboratory Module Testing the Plausibility of the Mythical Origin of the India Pale Ale (IPA)\nAuthors: Pineda, J. M.; Scholes, A. N.; Lewis, J. A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550083\nAs one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.</p>
