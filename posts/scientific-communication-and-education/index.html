Prestigious journals are thought to pursue a reputation of exclusivity by rejecting large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of the work that warrants recognition.\nA Quantitative Study of Inappropriate Image Duplication in the Journal Toxicology Reports\nAuthors: David, S.\nScore: 34.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556099\nInappropriate image duplication is a type of scientific error that can be detected by examining published literature. Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.\nHow prior and p-value heuristics are used when interpreting data\nAuthors: Hermer, E.; Irwin, A. A.; Roche, D. G.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556128\nScientific conclusions are based on the ways that researchers interpret data, a process that is shaped by psychological and cultural factors. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics to interpret data, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test the use of heuristics, we surveyed 623 researchers in biology and asked them to interpret scatterplots that showed ambiguous relationships, altering only the labels on the graphs. Our manipulations tested the use of two heuristics based on major statistical frameworks: (1) the strong prior heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is expected a priori, following Bayesian statistics, and (2) the p-value heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is associated with a small p-value, following null hypothesis statistical testing. Our results show that both the strong prior and p-value heuristics are common. Surprisingly, the strong prior heuristic was more prevalent among inexperienced researchers, whereas its effect was diminished among the most experienced biologists in our survey. By contrast, we find that p-values cause researchers at all levels to report that an ambiguous graph shows a strong result. Together, these results suggest that experience in the sciences may diminish a researchers Bayesian intuitions, while reinforcing the use of p-values as a shortcut for effect size. Reform to data science training in STEM could help reduce researchers reliance on error-prone heuristics. Significance StatementScientific researchers must interpret data and statistical tests to draw conclusions. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test how this occurs, we asked biologists to interpret graphs that showed an ambiguous relationship between two variables, and report whether the relationship was strong, weak, or absent. We altered features of the graph to test whether prior expectations or a statistic called the p-value could influence their interpretations. Our results indicate that both prior expectations and p-values can increase the probability that researchers will report that ambiguous data shows a strong result. These findings suggest that current training and research practices promote the use of error-prone shortcuts in decision-making.\nAn effective C. elegans CRISPR training module for high school and undergraduate summer research experiences in molecular biology\nAuthors: Herrera-Sandoval, C.; Borchers, C.; Aoki, S. T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557573\nEngaging in research experiences as a high school or undergraduate student interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is pivotal for their academic and professional development. A structured teaching framework can help cultivate student curiosity and passion for learning and research. In this study, an effective eight-week training program has been created that encompasses fundamental molecular biology principles and hands-on laboratory activities. This curriculum focuses on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism. Through pre- and post-program assessments, substantial enhancements in student molecular biology proficiency and enthusiasm for scientific exploration was observed. Overall, this diligently crafted training module that employs C. elegans as an educational tool to instruct inexperienced students has demonstrated its accessibility and ability to engage students in molecular biology and gene editing methodologies.\n",

Our manipulations tested the use of two heuristics based on major statistical frameworks: (1) the strong prior heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is expected a priori, following Bayesian statistics, and (2) the p-value heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is associated with a small p-value, following null hypothesis statistical testing. Our results show that both the strong prior and p-value heuristics are common. Surprisingly, the strong prior heuristic was more prevalent among inexperienced researchers, whereas its effect was diminished among the most experienced biologists in our survey. By contrast, we find that p-values cause researchers at all levels to report that an ambiguous graph shows a strong result. Together, these results suggest that experience in the sciences may diminish a researchers Bayesian intuitions, while reinforcing the use of p-values as a shortcut for effect size. Reform to data science training in STEM could help reduce researchers reliance on error-prone heuristics.

Significance StatementScientific researchers must interpret data and statistical tests to draw conclusions. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test how this occurs, we asked biologists to interpret graphs that showed an ambiguous relationship between two variables, and report whether the relationship was strong, weak, or absent. We altered features of the graph to test whether prior expectations or a statistic called the p-value could influence their interpretations. Our results indicate that both prior expectations and p-values can increase the probability that researchers will report that ambiguous data shows a strong result. These findings suggest that current training and research practices promote the use of error-prone shortcuts in decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Engaging in research experiences as a high school or undergraduate student interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is pivotal for their academic and professional development. A structured teaching framework can help cultivate student curiosity and passion for learning and research. In this study, an effective eight-week training program has been created that encompasses fundamental molecular biology principles and hands-on laboratory activities. This curriculum focuses on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism. Through pre- and post-program assessments, substantial enhancements in student molecular biology proficiency and enthusiasm for scientific exploration was observed. Overall, this diligently crafted training module that employs C. elegans as an educational tool to instruct inexperienced students has demonstrated its accessibility and ability to engage students in molecular biology and gene editing methodologies.</p>
