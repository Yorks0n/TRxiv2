R.; Lariviere, V.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554192\nWomen are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior. SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\"\nAnalytical code sharing practices in biomedical research\nAuthors: Sharma, N. K.; Ayyala, R.; Deshpande, D.; Patel, Y. M.; Munteanu, V.; Ciorba, D.; Fiscutean, A.; Vahed, M.; Sarkar, A.; Guo, R.; Moore, A.; Darci-Maher, N.; Nogoy, N. A.; Abedalthagafi, M. S.; Mangul, S.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551384\nData-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.\nA framework for decolonising and diversifying biomedical sciences curricula: rediscovery, representation and readiness\nAuthors: Lu, T.; Bashir, Z. I.; Dalceggio, A.; McKinnon, C.; Miles, L.; Mosley, A.; Burton, B. R.; Robson, A.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553224\nTo date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p\u003c0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this 3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.\nHow do conservationists choose where to publish?\nAuthors: Yoh, N.; Holle, M. J. M.; Willis, J.; Rudd, L. F.; Fraser, I. M.; Verissimo, D.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554591\nPublishing in academic journals helps disseminate scientific research and contributes to a researchers academic career. Conservation is interdisciplinary and, as such, there are a diversity of practitioners, scientists, and others who contribute to the conservation literature. Currently, little is known about how different journal attributes impact an authors choice of where to publish or how they may act as barriers to publishing in conservation-related journals. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine the interplay between seven attributes and assess journal choice between three demographic groups. Across 1038 respondents, we found that each group exhibited different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science.\nGraduate student mentorship as a target for diversifying the biological sciences\nAuthors: Debray, R.; Dewald-Wang, E. A.; Ennis, K.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553806\nDespite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers. SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.\nIs N-Hacking Ever OK? A Simulation-based study\nAuthors: Reinagel, P.\nScore: 96.5, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2019.12.12.868489\nAfter an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is \"not quite significant\". Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such \"N-hacking\" is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context.\nChatGPT applications in Academic Research: A Review of Benefits, Concerns, and Recommendations\nAuthors: AlZaabi, A.; ALamri, A.; Albalushi, H.; Aljabri, R.; AalAbdulsallam, A.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553688\nBackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences. MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research. ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as \"hallucinations.\" Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries. ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.\n\"Important enough to show the world\": Using Authentic Research Opportunities and Micropublications to Build Students Science Identities\nAuthors: Rubenstein, L. D.; Woodruff, K. A.; Taylor, A. M.; Olesen, J. B.; Smaldino, P. J.; Rubenstein, E. M.\nScore: 60.4, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553701\nPrimarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to \"recipe-driven\" lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure \"micropublications\" has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.\nChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review\nAuthors: Verharen, J. P. H.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549552\nThe peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.\nThe faculty-to-faculty mentorship experience: a survey on challenges and recommendations for improvements\nAuthors: Sarabipour, S.; Burgess, S. J.; Niemi, N. M.; Smith, C. T.; Bisson Filho, A. W.; Ibrahim, A.; Clark, K.\nScore: 73.1, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.17.512624\nFaculty at research institutions play a central role in advancing knowledge and careers, as well as promoting the well-being of students and colleagues in research environments. Faculty members must balance a host of activities - such as performing research, teaching, sourcing funds, administrative and service duties - with their roles as educators and mentors. Mentorship from experienced peers has been touted as critical for enabling these myriad roles to allow faculty development, career progression, and satisfaction. However, there is little information available on who supports faculty and best ways to structure a faculty mentorship program for early- and mid-career academics. Furthermore, the extent to which mentorship and mentoring programs have been offered to faculty members has not been widely characterized. It is also unclear what challenges faculty receiving mentorship may face and which aspects could be further improved. In the interest of advocating for increased and enhanced faculty mentoring and mentoring programs, we surveyed faculty (i.e., group leaders) around the world to gather data on whether and how they receive mentoring from peers, senior researchers, informal mentoring programs, or formal mentoring programs at their institutions. We received responses from 457 early- and mid-career faculty and found that a substantial portion of respondents either reported having no mentor or a lack of a formal mentoring scheme. Qualitative responses on the quality of mentorship revealed that the most common complaints regarding mentorship included lack of mentor availability, unsatisfactory commitment to mentorship, and non-specific or non-actionable advice. Our findings further identified key mentorship elements desired by faculty mentees. Based on these suggestions, we identify a need for training for faculty mentors as well as strategies for individual mentors, departments, and institutions for funding and design of more intentional and supportive mentorship programs for early- and mid-career faculty.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Women are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34; We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior.

SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34;</p>

        <p class="abstract">Data-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p&lt;0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this  3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Publishing in academic journals helps disseminate scientific research and contributes to a researchers academic career. Conservation is interdisciplinary and, as such, there are a diversity of practitioners, scientists, and others who contribute to the conservation literature. Currently, little is known about how different journal attributes impact an authors choice of where to publish or how they may act as barriers to publishing in conservation-related journals. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine the interplay between seven attributes and assess journal choice between three demographic groups. Across 1038 respondents, we found that each group exhibited different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers.

SignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is &#34;not quite significant&#34;. Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such &#34;N-hacking&#34; is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences.

MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research.

ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as &#34;hallucinations.&#34; Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries.

ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to &#34;recipe-driven&#34; lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure &#34;micropublications&#34; has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Faculty at research institutions play a central role in advancing knowledge and careers, as well as promoting the well-being of students and colleagues in research environments. Faculty members must balance a host of activities - such as performing research, teaching, sourcing funds, administrative and service duties - with their roles as educators and mentors. Mentorship from experienced peers has been touted as critical for enabling these myriad roles to allow faculty development, career progression, and satisfaction. However, there is little information available on who supports faculty and best ways to structure a faculty mentorship program for early- and mid-career academics. Furthermore, the extent to which mentorship and mentoring programs have been offered to faculty members has not been widely characterized. It is also unclear what challenges faculty receiving mentorship may face and which aspects could be further improved. In the interest of advocating for increased and enhanced faculty mentoring and mentoring programs, we surveyed faculty (i.e., group leaders) around the world to gather data on whether and how they receive mentoring from peers, senior researchers, informal mentoring programs, or formal mentoring programs at their institutions. We received responses from 457 early- and mid-career faculty and found that a substantial portion of respondents either reported having no mentor or a lack of a formal mentoring scheme. Qualitative responses on the quality of mentorship revealed that the most common complaints regarding mentorship included lack of mentor availability, unsatisfactory commitment to mentorship, and non-specific or non-actionable advice. Our findings further identified key mentorship elements desired by faculty mentees. Based on these suggestions, we identify a need for training for faculty mentors as well as strategies for individual mentors, departments, and institutions for funding and design of more intentional and supportive mentorship programs for early- and mid-career faculty.</p>
