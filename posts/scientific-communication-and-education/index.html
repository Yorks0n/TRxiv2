Yet the mechanisms by which CUREs contribute to student integration and persistence are poorly understood. Utilizing the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI), this longitudinal study examines how Tiny Earth, an antibiotic-discovery CURE, impacts students scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, endorsement of scientific community values, and intentions to persist in science. The study also explores how gains in TIMSI factors vary as a function of student demographics and course characteristics. Results of pre-and post-course measurements show that scientific self-efficacy and identity increased among students in Tiny Earth, and some student demographics and course characteristics moderated these gains. Gains in scientific self-efficacy, identity, and values correlated with gains in persistence intentions, whereas student demographics and course characteristics did not. Results of this study show that the Tiny Earth CURE enhanced students integration into the scientific community, which was linked to intentions of students of both historically underrepresented and majority groups to persist in STEM. We discuss how courses that provide opportunity to learn science skills in the context of a CURE can contribute toward enlarging and diversifying the STEM workforce.\nImproving modelling for epidemic responses: reflections from members of the UK infectious disease modelling community on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Sherratt, K.; Carnegie, A.

The sustained high pressure of a pandemic on responders, such as healthcare workers, can lead to lasting psychological impacts including acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and moral injury, which can impact individual wellbeing and productivity. As members of the infectious disease modelling community, we convened a reflective workshop to understand the professional and personal impacts of response work on our community and to propose recommendations for future epidemic responses. The attendees represented a range of career stages, institutions, and disciplines. This piece was collectively produced by those present at the session based on our collective experiences. Key issues we identified at the workshop were lack of institutional support, insecure contracts, unequal credit and recognition, and mental health impacts. Our recommendations include rewarding impactful work, fostering academia-public health collaboration, decreasing dependence on key individuals by developing teams, increasing transparency in decision-making, and implementing sustainable work practices. Despite limitations in representation, this workshop provided valuable insights into the UK COVID-19 modelling experience and guidance for future public health crises. Recognising and addressing the issues highlighted is crucial, in our view, for ensuring the effectiveness of epidemic response work in the future.\n",
