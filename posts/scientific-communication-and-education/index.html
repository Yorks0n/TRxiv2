Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.\nBiomedical researchers perspectives on the reproducibility of research: a cross-sectional international survey\nAuthors: Cobey, K. D.; Ebrahimzadeh, S.; Page, M.; Thibault, R.; Nguyen, P.-Y.; Abu-Dalfa, F.; Moher, D.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558287\nWe conducted an international cross-sectional survey of biomedical researchers perspectives on the reproducibility of research. This study builds on a widely cited 2016 survey on reproducibility, and provides a biomedical-specific and contemporary perspective on reproducibility. To sample the community, we randomly selected 400 journals indexed in MEDLINE, from which we extracted the author names and e-mails from all articles published between October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2021. We invited participants to complete an anonymous online survey which collected basic demographic information, perceptions about a reproducibility crisis, perceived causes of irreproducibility of research results, experience conducting replication studies, and knowledge of funding and training for research on reproducibility. A total of 1924 participants accessed our survey, of which 1630 provided useable responses (response rate 7% of 23,234). Key findings include that 72% of participants agreed there was a reproducibility crisis in biomedicine, with 27% of participants indicating the crisis was significant. The leading perceived cause of irreproducibility was a pressure to publish with 62% of participants indicating it always or very often contributes. About half of the participants (54%) had run a replication of their own previously published study while slightly more (57%) had run a replication of another researchers study. Just 16% of participants indicated their institution had established procedures to enhance the reproducibility of biomedical research; and 67% felt their institution valued new research over replication studies. Participants also reported few opportunities to obtain funding to attempt to reproduce a study and 83% perceived it would be harder to do so than to get funding to do a novel study. Our results may be used to guide training and interventions to improve research reproducibility and to monitor rates of reproducibility over time. The findings are also relevant to policy makers and academic leadership looking to create incentives and research cultures that support reproducibility and value research quality.\nControlled experiment finds no detectable citation bump from Twitter promotion\nAuthors: Branch, T.; C?te, I. M.; David, S. R.; Drew, J. A.; LaRue, M.; Marquez, M. C.; Parsons, E. C. M.; Rabaiotti, D.; Shiffman, D.; Steen, D. A.; Wild, A. L.\nScore: 233.1, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558161\nMultiple studies across a variety of scientific disciplines have shown that the number of times that a paper is shared on Twitter (now called X) is correlated with the number of citations that paper receives. However, these studies were not designed to answer whether tweeting about scientific papers causes an increase in citations, or whether they were simply highlighting that some papers have higher relevance, importance or quality and are therefore both tweeted about more and cited more. The authors of this study are leading science communicators on Twitter from several life science disciplines, with substantially higher follower counts than the average scientist, making us uniquely placed to address this question. We conducted a three-year-long controlled experiment, randomly selecting five articles published in the same month and journal, and randomly tweeting one while retaining the others as controls. This process was repeated for 10 articles from each of 11 journals, recording Altmetric scores, number of tweets, and citation counts before and after tweeting. Randomization tests revealed that tweeted articles were downloaded 2.6-3.9 times more often than controls immediately after tweeting, and retained significantly higher Altmetric scores (+81%) and number of tweets (+105%) three years after tweeting. However, while some tweeted papers were cited more than their respective control papers published in the same journal and month, the overall increase in citation counts after three years (+7% for Web of Science and +12% for Google Scholar) was not statistically significant (p \u003e 0.15). Therefore while discussing science on social media has many professional and societal benefits (and has been a lot of fun), increasing the citation rate of a scientists papers is likely not among them.\nDevelopment of an undergraduate cell biology laboratory to assess pigmentation and cell size in a zebrafish model of uveal melanoma\nAuthors: Henle, A. M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558009\nThis study outlines a two-week laboratory module for an authentic cell biology undergraduate research experience that uses zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular model organism for research. Previous research has indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences such as this one increase student confidence, active learning, and retention. During this research experience, students investigate variations in pigmentation in the caudal fins of wild type and transgenic fish (Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L)). The transgenic fish express a hyperactive G protein, GNAQQ209L, under the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter, offering insights into uveal melanoma, a common eye cancer. Students specifically analyze the black pigmented cells, melanophores, within the caudal fin. We determined that the transgenic zebrafish have increased pigmentation in their caudal fins but smaller melanophores. These results suggest there are more melanophores in the Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L) fish compared to the wild type. Future undergraduate research could investigate these cellular differences. This research experience imparts microscopy and image analysis skills and instills the ability to grapple with large datasets, statistical tests, and data interpretation in alignment with biology education principles. Post-lab surveys reveal students attain confidence in the above skills and in handling animals, along with a deeper appreciation for model organism research and its relevance to cancer cell biology.\nAn effective C. elegans CRISPR training module for high school and undergraduate summer research experiences in molecular biology\nAuthors: Herrera-Sandoval, C.; Borchers, C.; Aoki, S. T.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557573\nEngaging in research experiences as a high school or undergraduate student interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is pivotal for their academic and professional development. A structured teaching framework can help cultivate a students curiosity and passion for learning and research. In this study, an effective eight-week training program has been created that encompasses fundamental molecular biology principles and hands-on laboratory activities. This curriculum focuses on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism. Through pre- and post-program assessments, substantial enhancements in students molecular biology proficiency and enthusiasm for scientific exploration was observed. Overall, this diligently crafted training module that employs C. elegans as an educational tool to instruct inexperienced students has demonstrated its accessibility and ability to engage students in molecular biology and gene editing methodologies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multiple studies across a variety of scientific disciplines have shown that the number of times that a paper is shared on Twitter (now called X) is correlated with the number of citations that paper receives. However, these studies were not designed to answer whether tweeting about scientific papers causes an increase in citations, or whether they were simply highlighting that some papers have higher relevance, importance or quality and are therefore both tweeted about more and cited more. The authors of this study are leading science communicators on Twitter from several life science disciplines, with substantially higher follower counts than the average scientist, making us uniquely placed to address this question. We conducted a three-year-long controlled experiment, randomly selecting five articles published in the same month and journal, and randomly tweeting one while retaining the others as controls. This process was repeated for 10 articles from each of 11 journals, recording Altmetric scores, number of tweets, and citation counts before and after tweeting. Randomization tests revealed that tweeted articles were downloaded 2.6-3.9 times more often than controls immediately after tweeting, and retained significantly higher Altmetric scores (&#43;81%) and number of tweets (&#43;105%) three years after tweeting. However, while some tweeted papers were cited more than their respective control papers published in the same journal and month, the overall increase in citation counts after three years (&#43;7% for Web of Science and &#43;12% for Google Scholar) was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.15). Therefore while discussing science on social media has many professional and societal benefits (and has been a lot of fun), increasing the citation rate of a scientists papers is likely not among them.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study outlines a two-week laboratory module for an authentic cell biology undergraduate research experience that uses zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular model organism for research. Previous research has indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences such as this one increase student confidence, active learning, and retention. During this research experience, students investigate variations in pigmentation in the caudal fins of wild type and transgenic fish (Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L)). The transgenic fish express a hyperactive G protein, GNAQQ209L, under the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter, offering insights into uveal melanoma, a common eye cancer. Students specifically analyze the black pigmented cells, melanophores, within the caudal fin. We determined that the transgenic zebrafish have increased pigmentation in their caudal fins but smaller melanophores. These results suggest there are more melanophores in the Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L) fish compared to the wild type. Future undergraduate research could investigate these cellular differences. This research experience imparts microscopy and image analysis skills and instills the ability to grapple with large datasets, statistical tests, and data interpretation in alignment with biology education principles. Post-lab surveys reveal students attain confidence in the above skills and in handling animals, along with a deeper appreciation for model organism research and its relevance to cancer cell biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Engaging in research experiences as a high school or undergraduate student interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is pivotal for their academic and professional development. A structured teaching framework can help cultivate a students curiosity and passion for learning and research. In this study, an effective eight-week training program has been created that encompasses fundamental molecular biology principles and hands-on laboratory activities. This curriculum focuses on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism. Through pre- and post-program assessments, substantial enhancements in students molecular biology proficiency and enthusiasm for scientific exploration was observed. Overall, this diligently crafted training module that employs C. elegans as an educational tool to instruct inexperienced students has demonstrated its accessibility and ability to engage students in molecular biology and gene editing methodologies.</p>
