To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy \u0026 Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020. Over three cohorts, the program was focused on practical skills and concepts, networking, and career development opportunities, and providing pathways for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to learn about and in many cases fully transition into science policy and advocacy roles and careers. Program participants were exposed to many important aspects of what it means to be involved in science policy and advocacy, and many chose to enter the field through subsequent opportunities facilitated by the program training. We sought to reduce a number of barriers to program participation, and additionally provided resources for others to develop similar programs at their university.

Theory and Methods: LLR methods with random matrix theory-based thresholds are successfully used in the denoising of MR image series in a number of applications. The performance of these methods depend on how well the LLR assumption is satisfied, which deteriorates with few numbers of images, as is commonly encountered in quantitative MRI applications. We propose a transform-domain approach for denoising of MR image series to represent the underlying signal with higher fidelity when using a locally low rank approximation. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated for fully-sampled k-space, undersampled k-space, DICOM images, and complex-valued SENSE-1 images in quantitative MRI applications with as few as 4 images. Results: For both MSK and brain applications, the transform domain denoising preserves local subtle variability, whereas the quantitative maps based on image domain LLR methods tend to be locally more homogeneous. Conclusion: A transform domain extension to LLR denoising produces high quality images and is compatible with both raw k-space data and vendor reconstructed data. This allows for improved imaging and more accurate quantitative analyses and parameters obtained therefrom.\n",
