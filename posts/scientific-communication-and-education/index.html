Reviewers rarely comment on the same aspects of a manuscript, making it difficult to properly assess manuscripts' quality and the quality of the peer review process. It was the goal of this pilot study to evaluate structured peer review implementation by: 1) exploring if and how reviewers answered structured peer review questions, 2) analysing reviewer agreement, 3) comparing that agreement to agreement before implementation of structured peer review, and 4) further enhancing the piloted set of structured peer review questions. Methods. Structured peer review consisting of 9 questions was piloted in August 2022 in 220 Elsevier journals. We randomly selected 10% of these journals across all fields and IF quartiles and included manuscripts that in the first 2 months of the pilot received 2 reviewer reports, leaving us with 107 manuscripts belonging to 23 journals. Eight questions had open ended fields, while the ninth question (on language editing) had only a yes/no option. Reviews could also leave Comments-to-Author and Comments-to-Editor. Answers were qualitatively analysed by two raters independently. Results. Almost all reviewers (n=196, 92%) filled out the answers to all questions even though these questions were not mandatory in the system. The longest answer (Md 27 words, IQR 11 to 68) was for reporting methods with sufficient details for replicability or reproducibility. Reviewers had highest (partial) agreement (of 72%) for assessing the flow and structure of the manuscript, and lowest (of 53%) for assessing if interpretation of results are supported by data, and for assessing if statistical analyses were appropriate and reported in sufficient detail (also 52%). Two thirds of reviewers (n=145, 68%) filled out the Comments-to-Author section, of which 105 (49%) resembled traditional peer review reports. Such reports contained a Md of 4 (IQR 3 to 5) topics covered by the structured questions. Absolute agreement regarding final recommendations (exact match of recommendation choice) was 41%, which was higher than what those journals had in the period of 2019 to 2021 (31% agreement, P=0.0275). Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that reviewers adapted to the new format of review successfully, and answered more topics than they covered in their traditional reports. Individual question analysis indicated highest disagreement regarding interpretation of results and conducting and reporting of statistical analyses. While structured peer review did lead to improvement in reviewer final recommendation agreements, this was not a randomized trial, and further studies should be done to corroborate this. Further research is also needed to determine if structured peer review leads to greater knowledge transfer or better improvement of manuscripts.\nMore than a token photo: humanizing scientists enhances student engagement\nAuthors: Costello, R. A.; Driessen, E. P.; Kjelvik, M. K.; Schultheis, E. H.; Youngblood, R. M.; Zemenick, A. T.; Weber, M. G.; Ballen, C. J.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577791\nHighlighting scientists from historically excluded groups in educational materials increases student engagement in STEM. However, which specific elements of these educational materials maximize their impact remains untested, leaving educators guessing how to best highlight counter-stereotypical scientists in their classrooms. We tested the effects of including visual and humanizing descriptions of scientists featured in quantitative biology activities on over 3,700 students across 36 undergraduate institutions. We found that including humanizing information about counter-stereotypical scientists increased the extent to which students related to those scientists, which in turn translated to higher student engagement. Students who shared one or more excluded identity(s) with the featured scientists related most strongly. Our findings demonstrate the importance of humanizing counter-stereotypical scientists in classrooms, beyond simply adding a photo to increase representation.\nNationwide Inclusive Facilitator Training: Mindsets, Practices and Growth\nAuthors: Codding, D.; Yen, A. H.; Lewis, H.; Johnson-Ojeda, V.; Frey, R. F.; Hokanson, S. C.; Goldberg, B. B.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574770\nAdvancing diversity in STEM requires competent and confident faculty and staff who can lead local professional development in inclusive teaching to improve classroom instruction and support all learners. This paper examines how a facilitator training model designed to promote inclusive facilitation impacted inclusive learning community facilitator self-reported confidence and practices. This mixed methods study reports on survey data from project trained facilitators (n=75) collected over four course runs. Facilitators reported significant increases in confidence, with the largest effect sizes in areas related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and identity. Qualitative findings indicate the training model effectively aligned facilitators with our approach to inclusive facilitation. Findings demonstrate that professional development in inclusive teaching, and by extension in other equity and diversity topics, can be successfully done at a national scale by centering identity, power, and positionality while upholding do no harm. This paper provides a strategy for how DEI-focused faculty development efforts can select, train, and support facilitators on a national scale while maintaining high fidelity to project values and goals.\nEffectiveness of a network Open House model to recruit trainees to post-baccalaureate STEM programs\nAuthors: Aoki, S. T.; Lewellyn, L.; Justice, S.; Mordan-McCombs, S.; Tewari, N.; Cantu, J.; Seiser, R.; Lakhani, A.; Kowalski, J. R.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574670\nPost-baccalaureate (post-bac) programs can have a positive impact on science training and STEM career opportunities for junior trainees. A goal for many of these sponsored programs is to increase research exposure for underrepresented minorities, a group that can include African American, Hispanic, Native American, and first-generation college students, among others. Recruiting underrepresented minorities to post-bac programs can be challenging, for reasons that include a lack of available research opportunities, time to pursue these experiences, and awareness of available programs. To this end, an Open House event was created to inform and excite potential students for future post-bac programs. Students were recruited from partnering Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to attend a two-day event at a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) and a research-intensive R1 institution. The students visited both campuses, were informed about post-bac programs and potential research opportunities, and met with faculty, current graduate students, and a former post-bac scholar. Transportation, lodging, and meals were provided. Visiting students completed voluntary pre- and post-surveys. Results indicated that attendees, the majority of whom were underrepresented minorities in STEM, left the event with an increased understanding about post-bac programs and their benefits to a career in STEM and that their attendance at the event made it more likely they would apply to available post-bac programs. Thus, this work demonstrates that in-person events involving integrative partnerships across multiple universities are effective strategies for increasing awareness of opportunities available to students post-graduation and for recruiting underrepresented groups in STEM to post-bac programs.\nUse of Large Language Models to Aid Analysis of Textual Data\nAuthors: Tai, R. H.; Bentley, L. R.; Xia, X.; Sitt, J. M.; Fankhauser, S. C.; Chicas-Mosier, A. M.; Monteith, B. G.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549361\nThe increasing use of machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up opportunities to use these artificially intelligent algorithms in novel ways. This article proposes a methodology using LLMs to support traditional deductive coding in qualitative research. We began our analysis with three different sample texts taken from existing interviews. Next, we created a codebook and inputted the sample text and codebook into an LLM. We asked the LLM to determine if the codes were present in a sample text provided and requested evidence to support the coding. The sample texts were inputted 160 times to record changes between iterations of the LLM response. Each iteration was analogous to a new coder deductively analyzing the text with the codebook information. In our results, we present the outputs for these recursive analyses, along with a comparison of the LLM coding to evaluations made by human coders using traditional coding methods. We argue that LLM analysis can aid qualitative researchers by deductively coding transcripts, providing a systematic and reliable platform for code identification, and offering a means of avoiding analysis misalignment. Implications of using LLM in research praxis are discussed, along with current limitations.\nLimited Diffusion of Scientific Knowledge Forecasts Collapse\nAuthors: Kang, D.; Danziger, R. S.; Rehman, J.; Evans, J. A.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.15.536986\nMarket bubbles emerge when asset prices are driven unsustainably higher than asset values and shifts in belief burst them. We demonstrate the same phenomenon for biomedical knowledge when promising research receives inflated attention. We predict deflationary events by developing a diffusion index that captures whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate our diffusion approach contrasting the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research and cancer immunotherapy. We then trace the diffusion of unique 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9M papers and more than 80M citations and demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge.\nPhase 1 of the NIH Preprint Pilot: Testing the viability of making preprints discoverable in PubMed Central and PubMed\nAuthors: Funk, K.; Zayas-Caban, T.; Beck, J.\nScore: 56.4, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.12.520156\nIntroductionThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) launched a Pilot in June 2020 to: 1) explore the feasibility and utility of adding preprints to PubMed Central (PMC) and making them discoverable in PubMed, and 2) to support accelerated discoverability of National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported research without compromising user trust in NLMs widely used literature services. MethodsThe first phase of the Pilot focused on archiving preprints reporting NIH-supported SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research. To launch Phase 1, NLM identified eligible preprint servers and developed processes for identifying NIH-supported preprints within scope in these servers. Processes were also developed for the ingest and conversion of preprints in PMC and to send corresponding records to PubMed. User interfaces were modified for display of preprint records. NLM collected data on the preprints ingested and discovery of preprint records in PMC and PubMed and engaged users through focus groups and a survey to obtain direct feedback on the Pilot and perceptions of preprints. ResultsBetween June 2020 and June 2022, NLM added more than 3,300 preprint records to PMC (viewed 4 million times) and PubMed (viewed 3 million times) Nearly one-quarter of preprints in the Pilot were not associated with a peer-reviewed published journal article. User feedback revealed that the inclusion of preprints did not have a notable impact on trust in PMC or PubMed. DiscussionNIH-supported preprints can be identified and added to PMC and PubMed without disrupting existing operations processes. Additionally, inclusion of preprints in PMC and PubMed accelerates discovery of NIH research without reducing trust in NLM literature services. Phase 1 of the Pilot provided a useful testbed for studying NIH investigator preprint posting practices, as well as knowledge gaps among user groups, during the COVID-19 public health emergency, an unusual time with heightened interest in immediate access to research results.\nA Retrospective Analysis of Career Outcomes in Neuroscience\nAuthors: Ullrich, L. E.; Ogawa, J. R.; Jones-London, M. D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578220\nWhat factors are associated with different career outcomes among biomedical PhDs? Much of the research to-date has focused on drivers of interest in (and intention to pursue) various careers, especially during graduate school, but fewer studies have investigated the ultimate career outcomes of participants. Even less is known about what factors matter most for groups historically underrepresented in the US STEM workforce, such as for women, some racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), 2021a). This study reports a new analysis of data from 781 PhD neuroscientists that were obtained from a retrospective survey (reported in Ullrich et al. (2021)) to investigate the factors that influence the career sector in which neuroscience PhDs are employed, and whether there were group differences according to social identity. We find evidence of academia as a \"default path\" for incoming PhD students, but interest in different careers changes gradually over time. Those who remained in academia had greater acceptance of the structural aspects of academic careers, such as the promotion and tenure process, and greater faculty support during their postdoctoral training. Conversely, prioritizing monetary compensation and wanting varied work were associated with not being in academia, while a strong interest in research was positively associated with being in non-academic research. Somewhat surprisingly, there were few interactions with gender, and no interactions with underrepresentation status. Our findings also underscore the role of advisors, networking, and personal relationships in securing employment in STEM.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background. Reviewers rarely comment on the same aspects of a manuscript, making it difficult to properly assess manuscripts&#39; quality and the quality of the peer review process. It was the goal of this pilot study to evaluate structured peer review implementation by: 1) exploring if and how reviewers answered structured peer review questions, 2) analysing reviewer agreement, 3) comparing that agreement to agreement before implementation of structured peer review, and 4) further enhancing the piloted set of structured peer review questions. Methods. Structured peer review consisting of 9 questions was piloted in August 2022 in 220 Elsevier journals. We randomly selected 10% of these journals across all fields and IF quartiles and included manuscripts that in the first 2 months of the pilot received 2 reviewer reports, leaving us with 107 manuscripts belonging to 23 journals. Eight questions had open ended fields, while the ninth question (on language editing) had only a yes/no option. Reviews could also leave Comments-to-Author and Comments-to-Editor. Answers were qualitatively analysed by two raters independently. Results. Almost all reviewers (n=196, 92%) filled out the answers to all questions even though these questions were not mandatory in the system. The longest answer (Md 27 words, IQR 11 to 68) was for reporting methods with sufficient details for replicability or reproducibility. Reviewers had highest (partial) agreement (of 72%) for assessing the flow and structure of the manuscript, and lowest (of 53%) for assessing if interpretation of results are supported by data, and for assessing if statistical analyses were appropriate and reported in sufficient detail (also 52%). Two thirds of reviewers (n=145, 68%) filled out the Comments-to-Author section, of which 105 (49%) resembled traditional peer review reports. Such reports contained a Md of 4 (IQR 3 to 5) topics covered by the structured questions. Absolute agreement regarding final recommendations (exact match of recommendation choice) was 41%, which was higher than what those journals had in the period of 2019 to 2021 (31% agreement, P=0.0275). Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that reviewers adapted to the new format of review successfully, and answered more topics than they covered in their traditional reports. Individual question analysis indicated highest disagreement regarding interpretation of results and conducting and reporting of statistical analyses. While structured peer review did lead to improvement in reviewer final recommendation agreements, this was not a randomized trial, and further studies should be done to corroborate this. Further research is also needed to determine if structured peer review leads to greater knowledge transfer or better improvement of manuscripts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highlighting scientists from historically excluded groups in educational materials increases student engagement in STEM. However, which specific elements of these educational materials maximize their impact remains untested, leaving educators guessing how to best highlight counter-stereotypical scientists in their classrooms. We tested the effects of including visual and humanizing descriptions of scientists featured in quantitative biology activities on over 3,700 students across 36 undergraduate institutions. We found that including humanizing information about counter-stereotypical scientists increased the extent to which students related to those scientists, which in turn translated to higher student engagement. Students who shared one or more excluded identity(s) with the featured scientists related most strongly. Our findings demonstrate the importance of humanizing counter-stereotypical scientists in classrooms, beyond simply adding a photo to increase representation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advancing diversity in STEM requires competent and confident faculty and staff who can lead local professional development in inclusive teaching to improve classroom instruction and support all learners. This paper examines how a facilitator training model designed to promote inclusive facilitation impacted inclusive learning community facilitator self-reported confidence and practices. This mixed methods study reports on survey data from project trained facilitators (n=75) collected over four course runs. Facilitators reported significant increases in confidence, with the largest effect sizes in areas related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and identity. Qualitative findings indicate the training model effectively aligned facilitators with our approach to inclusive facilitation. Findings demonstrate that professional development in inclusive teaching, and by extension in other equity and diversity topics, can be successfully done at a national scale by centering identity, power, and positionality while upholding  do no harm. This paper provides a strategy for how DEI-focused faculty development efforts can select, train, and support facilitators on a national scale while maintaining high fidelity to project values and goals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-baccalaureate (post-bac) programs can have a positive impact on science training and STEM career opportunities for junior trainees. A goal for many of these sponsored programs is to increase research exposure for underrepresented minorities, a group that can include African American, Hispanic, Native American, and first-generation college students, among others. Recruiting underrepresented minorities to post-bac programs can be challenging, for reasons that include a lack of available research opportunities, time to pursue these experiences, and awareness of available programs. To this end, an Open House event was created to inform and excite potential students for future post-bac programs. Students were recruited from partnering Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to attend a two-day event at a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) and a research-intensive R1 institution. The students visited both campuses, were informed about post-bac programs and potential research opportunities, and met with faculty, current graduate students, and a former post-bac scholar. Transportation, lodging, and meals were provided. Visiting students completed voluntary pre- and post-surveys. Results indicated that attendees, the majority of whom were underrepresented minorities in STEM, left the event with an increased understanding about post-bac programs and their benefits to a career in STEM and that their attendance at the event made it more likely they would apply to available post-bac programs. Thus, this work demonstrates that in-person events involving integrative partnerships across multiple universities are effective strategies for increasing awareness of opportunities available to students post-graduation and for recruiting underrepresented groups in STEM to post-bac programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing use of machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up opportunities to use these artificially intelligent algorithms in novel ways. This article proposes a methodology using LLMs to support traditional deductive coding in qualitative research. We began our analysis with three different sample texts taken from existing interviews. Next, we created a codebook and inputted the sample text and codebook into an LLM. We asked the LLM to determine if the codes were present in a sample text provided and requested evidence to support the coding. The sample texts were inputted 160 times to record changes between iterations of the LLM response. Each iteration was analogous to a new coder deductively analyzing the text with the codebook information. In our results, we present the outputs for these recursive analyses, along with a comparison of the LLM coding to evaluations made by human coders using traditional coding methods. We argue that LLM analysis can aid qualitative researchers by deductively coding transcripts, providing a systematic and reliable platform for code identification, and offering a means of avoiding analysis misalignment. Implications of using LLM in research praxis are discussed, along with current limitations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Market bubbles emerge when asset prices are driven unsustainably higher than asset values and shifts in belief burst them. We demonstrate the same phenomenon for biomedical knowledge when promising research receives inflated attention. We predict deflationary events by developing a diffusion index that captures whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate our diffusion approach contrasting the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research and cancer immunotherapy. We then trace the diffusion of unique 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9M papers and more than 80M citations and demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) launched a Pilot in June 2020 to: 1) explore the feasibility and utility of adding preprints to PubMed Central (PMC) and making them discoverable in PubMed, and 2) to support accelerated discoverability of National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported research without compromising user trust in NLMs widely used literature services.

MethodsThe first phase of the Pilot focused on archiving preprints reporting NIH-supported SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research. To launch Phase 1, NLM identified eligible preprint servers and developed processes for identifying NIH-supported preprints within scope in these servers. Processes were also developed for the ingest and conversion of preprints in PMC and to send corresponding records to PubMed. User interfaces were modified for display of preprint records. NLM collected data on the preprints ingested and discovery of preprint records in PMC and PubMed and engaged users through focus groups and a survey to obtain direct feedback on the Pilot and perceptions of preprints.

ResultsBetween June 2020 and June 2022, NLM added more than 3,300 preprint records to PMC (viewed 4 million times) and PubMed (viewed 3 million times) Nearly one-quarter of preprints in the Pilot were not associated with a peer-reviewed published journal article. User feedback revealed that the inclusion of preprints did not have a notable impact on trust in PMC or PubMed.

DiscussionNIH-supported preprints can be identified and added to PMC and PubMed without disrupting existing operations processes. Additionally, inclusion of preprints in PMC and PubMed accelerates discovery of NIH research without reducing trust in NLM literature services. Phase 1 of the Pilot provided a useful testbed for studying NIH investigator preprint posting practices, as well as knowledge gaps among user groups, during the COVID-19 public health emergency, an unusual time with heightened interest in immediate access to research results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">What factors are associated with different career outcomes among biomedical PhDs? Much of the research to-date has focused on drivers of interest in (and intention to pursue) various careers, especially during graduate school, but fewer studies have investigated the ultimate career outcomes of participants. Even less is known about what factors matter most for groups historically underrepresented in the US STEM workforce, such as for women, some racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), 2021a). This study reports a new analysis of data from 781 PhD neuroscientists that were obtained from a retrospective survey (reported in Ullrich et al. (2021)) to investigate the factors that influence the career sector in which neuroscience PhDs are employed, and whether there were group differences according to social identity. We find evidence of academia as a &#34;default path&#34; for incoming PhD students, but interest in different careers changes gradually over time. Those who remained in academia had greater acceptance of the structural aspects of academic careers, such as the promotion and tenure process, and greater faculty support during their postdoctoral training. Conversely, prioritizing monetary compensation and wanting varied work were associated with not being in academia, while a strong interest in research was positively associated with being in non-academic research. Somewhat surprisingly, there were few interactions with gender, and no interactions with underrepresentation status. Our findings also underscore the role of advisors, networking, and personal relationships in securing employment in STEM.</p>
