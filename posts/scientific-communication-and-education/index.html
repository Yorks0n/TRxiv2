But, do awards incentivise greater transparency, diversity, and openness in science? Our cross-disciplinary survey of 222 awards for the \"best\" journal articles across all 27 SCImago subject areas revealed that journals and learned societies administering such awards generally publish little detail on their procedures and criteria. Award descriptions are brief, rarely including contact details or information on the nominations pool. Nominations of underrepresented groups are not explicitly encouraged and concepts that align with Open Science are almost absent from the assessment criteria. Instead, such awards increasingly rely on article-level impact metrics. USA-affiliated researchers dominated the winners pool (48%), while researchers from the Global South and developing countries were uncommon (11%). Sixty-one-percent of individual winners were men. Thus, Best Paper awards miss the global calls for greater transparency and equitable access to academic recognition.\nEvolving patterns of extremely productive publishing behavior across science\nAuthors: Ioannidis, J.; Collins, T. A.; Baas, J.\nScore: 46.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568476\nWe aimed to evaluate how many authors are extremely productive and how their presence across countries and scientific fields has changed during 2000-2022. Extremely productive (EP) authors were defined as those with \u003e60 full papers (articles, reviews, conference papers) published in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 EP authors across science excluding Physics and 12,624 EP authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of EP authors in the past, in 2022 the number of EP authors was almost similar in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of EP authors, followed by the USA. However, the largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 were seen in Thailand (19-fold), Saudi Arabia (11.5-fold), Spain (11.5-fold), India (10.2-fold), Italy (6.9-fold), Russia (6.5-fold), Pakistan (5.7-fold), and South Korea (5.2-fold). Excluding Physics, most EP authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries \u0026 Forestry (14.6-fold), Biology (13-fold), and Mathematics and Statistics (6.1-fold). EP authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most EP Physics authors had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of EP authors in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with \u003e=5 full papers. Extreme productivity has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings.\nFour Years of COVID-19: Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan Have the Highest Research Growth Rates From 2020-2023\nAuthors: Hassan, W.; Zafar, M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573759\nWe tried to assess the global research scholarly output after COVID-19 (from 2020 to 2023). Based on Scopus record, the world has produced 15, 041, 579 publications with 86, 165, 933 citations. We analyzed those countries, which have published at least 150, 000 research papers. For each country, we retrieved total number of publications, % growth rate, total citations, citations per paper, Field Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI), and % international collaboration. Twenty-seven (n=27) countries were found to be highly productive, with China leading the way in number of publications. Citation metrics are dominated by the USA, China, and European countries. Specifically, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Australia are notable for their high impact and influence. Saudi Arabia achieved the highest growth rate of 53.5%, and highest international collaboration (76.5%). Infact Saudi Arabia also attained high citations per article (8.8), and an FWCI of 1.63. While, Pakistan exhibited an 8.4 citations per article, FWCI of 1.54, growth rate of 34.9%, and collaborative percentage of 64.9%. Egypt also attained the 2nd highest growth rate (n=36.1). Based on four (n=4) distinct performance metrics, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were in the top ten group.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We tried to assess the global research scholarly output after COVID-19 (from 2020 to 2023). Based on Scopus record, the world has produced 15, 041, 579 publications with 86, 165, 933 citations. We analyzed those countries, which have published at least 150, 000 research papers. For each country, we retrieved total number of publications, % growth rate, total citations, citations per paper, Field Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI), and % international collaboration. Twenty-seven (n=27) countries were found to be highly productive, with China leading the way in number of publications. Citation metrics are dominated by the USA, China, and European countries. Specifically, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Australia are notable for their high impact and influence. Saudi Arabia achieved the highest growth rate of 53.5%, and highest international collaboration (76.5%). Infact Saudi Arabia also attained high citations per article (8.8), and an FWCI of 1.63. While, Pakistan exhibited an 8.4 citations per article, FWCI of 1.54, growth rate of 34.9%, and collaborative percentage of 64.9%. Egypt also attained the 2nd highest growth rate (n=36.1). Based on four (n=4) distinct performance metrics, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were in the top ten group.</p>
