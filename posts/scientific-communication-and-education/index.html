While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior. SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\"\n\"Important enough to show the world\": Using Authentic Research Opportunities and Micropublications to Build Students Science Identities\nAuthors: Rubenstein, L. D.; Woodruff, K. A.; Taylor, A. M.; Olesen, J. B.; Smaldino, P. J.; Rubenstein, E. M.\nScore: 52.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553701\nPrimarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to \"recipe-driven\" lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure \"micropublications\" has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.\nHow do conservationists choose where to publish?\nAuthors: Yoh, N.; Holle, M. J. M.; Willis, J.; Rudd, L. F.; Fraser, I. M.; Verissimo, D.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554591\nPublishing in academic journals helps disseminate scientific research and contributes to a researchers academic career. Conservation is interdisciplinary and, as such, there are a diversity of practitioners, scientists, and others who contribute to the conservation literature. Currently, little is known about how different journal attributes impact an authors choice of where to publish or how they may act as barriers to publishing in conservation-related journals. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine the interplay between seven attributes and assess journal choice between three demographic groups. Across 1038 respondents, we found that each group exhibited different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science.\nAnalytical code sharing practices in biomedical research\nAuthors: Sharma, N. K.; Ayyala, R.; Deshpande, D.; Patel, Y. M.; Munteanu, V.; Ciorba, D.; Fiscutean, A.; Vahed, M.; Sarkar, A.; Guo, R.; Moore, A.; Darci-Maher, N.; Nogoy, N. A.; Abedalthagafi, M. S.; Mangul, S.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551384\nData-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.\nChatGPT applications in Academic Research: A Review of Benefits, Concerns, and Recommendations\nAuthors: AlZaabi, A.; ALamri, A.; Albalushi, H.; Aljabri, R.; AalAbdulsallam, A.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553688\nBackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences. MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research. ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as \"hallucinations.\" Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries. ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.\nLongevity Bottlenecks\nAuthors: Florea, M.; Hamalainen, M.; Seebold, P.; Cheng, N.; Murray, P.; Colville, A. J.; Zheng, S.; Ingham, D.; Kantelal, R.; De Sicilia, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553936\nThe longevity field has received an influx of capital and talent over the past 5 years, but it is unclear where directing these resources would result in the biggest positive impact. We aimed to establish a systematic, rigorous and unbiased way to identify the areas where increased investment would accelerate progress across the whole longevity field the most. To do so, we surveyed [~]400 participants across various sectors of longevity, asking them to 1) identify the major bottlenecks they are experiencing, 2) list their most needed solution, and 3) rate the potential efficacy and barriers to development of various aging intervention strategies. We built a classification system of Bottlenecks and Solutions based on grouping related answers and found the most frequently listed bottlenecks to be 1) lack of validated aging biomarkers; 2) an overall lack of funding; and 3) lack of good models for aging studies. Surprisingly, the most wanted solution was greater availability of large public datasets. Indeed, a common theme across all answers was the need for a new data-centric structure of scientific research, where large datasets are routinely gathered and made available, access walls are removed, protocols are standardized, negative and unpublished data are shared, and AI systems are released on the data for automated discovery. Finally, a lack of regulatory clarity was listed as the biggest barrier to development across all interventions, whereas cellular reprogramming, organ replacement, and genetic medicine (gene therapies and gene editing) were perceived as the intervention strategies with the highest potential for increasing healthy lifespan. We provide these data as a resource for funding agencies, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and newcomers to the field as a means to identify high impact areas to fund and work on. Key takeawaysO_LI395 Participants were surveyed for their biggest bottlenecks and most needed solutions C_LIO_LITop Bottlenecks: lack of Validated Biomarkers; Overall lack of Funding and Slow \u0026 Expensive Models.

        <p class="abstract">Women are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34; We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior.

SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34;</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) often struggle to provide authentic research opportunities that culminate in peer-reviewed publications due to &#34;recipe-driven&#34; lab courses and the comprehensive body of work necessary for traditional scientific publication. However, the advent of short-form, single-figure &#34;micropublications&#34; has created novel opportunities for early-career scientists to make and publish authentic scientific contributions on a scale and in a timespan compatible with their training periods. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data. Further, they reported this process enabled them to identify as contributing members of the greater scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Publishing in academic journals helps disseminate scientific research and contributes to a researchers academic career. Conservation is interdisciplinary and, as such, there are a diversity of practitioners, scientists, and others who contribute to the conservation literature. Currently, little is known about how different journal attributes impact an authors choice of where to publish or how they may act as barriers to publishing in conservation-related journals. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine the interplay between seven attributes and assess journal choice between three demographic groups. Across 1038 respondents, we found that each group exhibited different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Data-driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences.

MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research.

ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as &#34;hallucinations.&#34; Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries.

ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The longevity field has received an influx of capital and talent over the past 5 years, but it is unclear where directing these resources would result in the biggest positive impact. We aimed to establish a systematic, rigorous and unbiased way to identify the areas where increased investment would accelerate progress across the whole longevity field the most. To do so, we surveyed [~]400 participants across various sectors of longevity, asking them to 1) identify the major bottlenecks they are experiencing, 2) list their most needed solution, and 3) rate the potential efficacy and barriers to development of various aging intervention strategies. We built a classification system of Bottlenecks and Solutions based on grouping related answers and found the most frequently listed bottlenecks to be 1) lack of validated aging biomarkers; 2) an overall lack of funding; and 3) lack of good models for aging studies. Surprisingly, the most wanted solution was greater availability of large public datasets. Indeed, a common theme across all answers was the need for a new data-centric structure of scientific research, where large datasets are routinely gathered and made available, access walls are removed, protocols are standardized, negative and unpublished data are shared, and AI systems are released on the data for automated discovery. Finally, a lack of regulatory clarity was listed as the biggest barrier to development across all interventions, whereas cellular reprogramming, organ replacement, and genetic medicine (gene therapies and gene editing) were perceived as the intervention strategies with the highest potential for increasing healthy lifespan. We provide these data as a resource for funding agencies, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and newcomers to the field as a means to identify high impact areas to fund and work on.
