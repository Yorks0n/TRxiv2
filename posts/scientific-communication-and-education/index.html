Authors: Chen, M.
Score: 76.4, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570879
While the recent development of cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET) makes it possible to identify various macromolecules inside cells and determine their structure at near-atomic resolution, it remains challenging to visualize the complex cellular environment at the atomic level. One of the main hurdles in cell visualization is to render the millions of molecules in real time computationally.">

One of the main hurdles in cell visualization is to render the millions of molecules in real time computationally. Here, using a video game engine, we demonstrate the capability of rendering massive biological macromolecules at the atomic level within their native environment. To facilitate the visualization, we also provide tools that help the interactive navigation inside the cells, as well as software that converts protein structures identified using CryoET to a scene that can be explored with the game engine.\nEvolving patterns of extremely productive publishing behavior across science\nAuthors: Ioannidis, J.; Collins, T. A.; Baas, J.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568476\nWe aimed to evaluate how many authors are extremely productive and how their presence across countries and scientific fields has changed during 2000-2022. Extremely productive (EP) authors were defined as those with \u003e60 full papers (articles, reviews, conference papers) published in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 EP authors across science excluding Physics and 12,624 EP authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of EP authors in the past, in 2022 the number of EP authors was almost similar in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of EP authors, followed by the USA. However, the largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 were seen in Thailand (19-fold), Saudi Arabia (11.5-fold), Spain (11.5-fold), India (10.2-fold), Italy (6.9-fold), Russia (6.5-fold), Pakistan (5.7-fold), and South Korea (5.2-fold). Excluding Physics, most EP authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries \u0026 Forestry (14.6-fold), Biology (13-fold), and Mathematics and Statistics (6.1-fold). EP authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most EP Physics authors had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of EP authors in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with \u003e=5 full papers. Extreme productivity has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings.\nDevelopment and Outcomes of an International Certificate Program in Science Policy and Advocacy for STEM PhD Students and Postdocs\nAuthors: Bankston, A.; Ralston, A.; Ly, J.; Singh, H.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568726\nScientists must play a significant role in enacting societal change by educating and advising policymakers on relevant policy topics. To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy \u0026 Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020. Over three cohorts, the program was focused on practical skills and concepts, networking, and career development opportunities, and providing pathways for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to learn about and in many cases fully transition into science policy and advocacy roles and careers. Program participants were exposed to many important aspects of what it means to be involved in science policy and advocacy, and many chose to enter the field through subsequent opportunities facilitated by the program training. We sought to reduce a number of barriers to program participation, and additionally provided resources for others to develop similar programs at their university. We believe this training model is innovative and can be recapitulated, and sincerely hope to see more universities create similar programs in the US and internationally in order to serve trainees interested in science policy and advocacy and facilitate their building impactful careers in the field for years to come.\n",
