L.\nScore: 202.6, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558161\nMultiple studies across a variety of scientific disciplines have shown that the number of times that a paper is shared on Twitter (now called X) is correlated with the number of citations that paper receives. However, these studies were not designed to answer whether tweeting about scientific papers causes an increase in citations, or whether they were simply highlighting that some papers have higher relevance, importance or quality and are therefore both tweeted about more and cited more. The authors of this study are leading science communicators on Twitter from several life science disciplines, with substantially higher follower counts than the average scientist, making us uniquely placed to address this question. We conducted a three-year-long controlled experiment, randomly selecting five articles published in the same month and journal, and randomly tweeting one while retaining the others as controls. This process was repeated for 10 articles from each of 11 journals, recording Altmetric scores, number of tweets, and citation counts before and after tweeting. Randomization tests revealed that tweeted articles were downloaded 2.6-3.9 times more often than controls immediately after tweeting, and retained significantly higher Altmetric scores (+81%) and number of tweets (+105%) three years after tweeting. However, while some tweeted papers were cited more than their respective control papers published in the same journal and month, the overall increase in citation counts after three years (+7% for Web of Science and +12% for Google Scholar) was not statistically significant (p \u003e 0.15). Therefore while discussing science on social media has many professional and societal benefits (and has been a lot of fun), increasing the citation rate of a scientists papers is likely not among them.\nA Quantitative Study of Inappropriate Image Duplication in the Journal Toxicology Reports\nAuthors: David, S.\nScore: 39.7, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556099\nInappropriate image duplication is a type of scientific error that can be detected by examining published literature. Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.\nYou do not receive enough recognition for your influential science\nAuthors: Arabi, S.; Ni, C.; Hutchins, B. I.\nScore: 47.0, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556750\nDuring career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals are thought to pursue a reputation of exclusivity by rejecting large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of the work that warrants recognition.\nDevelopment of an undergraduate cell biology laboratory to assess pigmentation and cell size in a zebrafish model of uveal melanoma\nAuthors: Henle, A. M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558009\nThis study outlines a two-week laboratory module for an authentic cell biology undergraduate research experience that uses zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular model organism for research. Previous research has indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences such as this one increase student confidence, active learning, and retention. During this research experience, students investigate variations in pigmentation in the caudal fins of wild type and transgenic fish (Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L)). The transgenic fish express a hyperactive G protein, GNAQQ209L, under the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter, offering insights into uveal melanoma, a common eye cancer. Students specifically analyze the black pigmented cells, melanophores, within the caudal fin. We determined that the transgenic zebrafish have increased pigmentation in their caudal fins but smaller melanophores. These results suggest there are more melanophores in the Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L) fish compared to the wild type. Future undergraduate research could investigate these cellular differences. This research experience imparts microscopy and image analysis skills and instills the ability to grapple with large datasets, statistical tests, and data interpretation in alignment with biology education principles. Post-lab surveys reveal students attain confidence in the above skills and in handling animals, along with a deeper appreciation for model organism research and its relevance to cancer cell biology.\nGender differences in submission behavior exacerbate publication disparities in elite journals\nAuthors: Basson, I.; Ni, C.; Badia, G.; Tufenkji, N.; Sugimoto, C. R.; Lariviere, V.\nScore: 35.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554192\nWomen are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior. SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their \"work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel\" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the \"work would fit better in a more specialized journal.\"\n",

Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals are thought to pursue a reputation of exclusivity by rejecting large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of the work that warrants recognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study outlines a two-week laboratory module for an authentic cell biology undergraduate research experience that uses zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular model organism for research. Previous research has indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences such as this one increase student confidence, active learning, and retention. During this research experience, students investigate variations in pigmentation in the caudal fins of wild type and transgenic fish (Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L)). The transgenic fish express a hyperactive G protein, GNAQQ209L, under the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter, offering insights into uveal melanoma, a common eye cancer. Students specifically analyze the black pigmented cells, melanophores, within the caudal fin. We determined that the transgenic zebrafish have increased pigmentation in their caudal fins but smaller melanophores. These results suggest there are more melanophores in the Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L) fish compared to the wild type. Future undergraduate research could investigate these cellular differences. This research experience imparts microscopy and image analysis skills and instills the ability to grapple with large datasets, statistical tests, and data interpretation in alignment with biology education principles. Post-lab surveys reveal students attain confidence in the above skills and in handling animals, along with a deeper appreciation for model organism research and its relevance to cancer cell biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Women are particularly underrepresented in journals of the highest scientific impact, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers and, when they have, to submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to Science, Nature, or PNAS because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34; We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior.

SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their &#34;work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel&#34; for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues. Men were more likely to indicate that the &#34;work would fit better in a more specialized journal.&#34;</p>
