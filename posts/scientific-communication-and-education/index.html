H.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549552\nThe peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.\nFactors and mediators impacting the number of undergraduate research mentees at a research-intensive Hispanic-serving institution\nAuthors: Monarrez, A.; Echegoyen, L.; Morales, D.; Seira, D.; Ramirez, M. A.; Wagler, A.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549659\nEngaging in undergraduate research experiences is known to have broad and positive impacts on college students. Despite the benefits, achieving faculty buy-in and support can be challenging even when faculty have strong research funding. In order to understand how to better support undergraduate research programs, we applied quantitative models to explore how the impact of research funding is mediated by faculty beliefs about undergraduate research mentoring in STEM disciplines. The results indicate that faculty characteristics and beliefs about the benefits and barriers of mentoring undergraduate students in research impact the number of students mentored even when accounting for research funding levels of the individual faculty. Practical recommendations are presented based on the models from this research project in order to provide insight into how centers or units on a campus may work with faculty to support and encourage mentoring of undergraduates in research in the biomedical sciences.\nOrigami-based growing tube model for reproducing shell shapes\nAuthors: Ueda, M.; Fukunaga, N.; Yamashita, N.; Yokoyama, Y.; Kida, H.; Matsuda, K.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549674\nMathematical models for shell morphology have been well-studied in theoretical morphology. The growing tube model proposed by Takashi Okamoto was developed to reproduce heteromorph ammonoids and can generate various shells by changing three parameters: curvature, torsion, and enlarging ratio. Previous studies in theoretical morphology have employed computers to visualize mathematical models. However, computers are not accessible to everyone, and merely observing the graphics of the reproduced shells does not deepen understanding of the mathematical model. Therefore, in this study, we considered using origami, which is inexpensive and readily available, to make users understand mathematical models through hands-on folding. First, we simplified the crease pattern of seashells, originally devised by an origami artist Tomoko Fuse, to create a basic crease pattern. We then identified the crease pattern elements corresponding to the three parameters in the growing tube model and the aperture-apex position determiner. Based on them, we reproduced various shell shapes, including a heteromorph-ammonoid-like shape, with origami. Finally, we investigated the constraints between parameters in the origami-growing tube model. The origami-growing tube model is expected to help disseminate mathematical models and promote theoretical biology.\nInternet-connected cortical organoids for project-based stem cell and neuroscience education\nAuthors: Elliott, M.

A.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.546418\nThe introduction of internet-connected technologies to the classroom has the potential to revolutionize STEM education by allowing students to perform experiments in complex models that are unattainable in traditional teaching laboratories. By connecting laboratory equipment to the cloud, we introduce students to experimentation in pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids in two different settings: Using microscopy to monitor organoid growth in an introductory tissue culture course, and using high density multielectrode arrays to perform neuronal stimulation and recording in an advanced neuroscience mathematics course. We demonstrate that this approach develops interest in stem cell and neuroscience in the students of both courses. All together, we propose cloud technologies as an effective and scalable approach for complex project-based university training. HIGHLIGHTS- Development of cortical organoids as pedagogical tools for undergraduate education. - Organoids implemented in a tissue culture course through cloud-enabled microscopy. - Multielectrode arrays allow for live organoid manipulation in a mathematics course. - Students self-report increased interest in neuroscience and stem cells topics.\nDevelopment and Assessment of a Sustainable PhD Internship Program Supporting Diverse Biomedical Career Outcomes\nAuthors: Brandt, P. D.; Whittington, D.; Wood, K. D.; Holmquist, C. E.; Nogueira, A. T.; Gaines, C. H.; Brennwald, P. J.; Layton, R. L.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548912\nA doctoral-level internship program was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the intent to create customizable experiential learning opportunities for biomedical trainees to support career exploration, preparation, and transition into their post-graduate professional roles. We report the outcomes of this program over a five-year period. During that 5-year period, 123 internships took place at over 70 partner sites, representing at least 20 academic, for-profit, and non-profit career paths in the life sciences. A major goal of the program was to enhance trainees skill development and expertise in careers of interest. The benefits of the internship program for interns, host/employer, and supervisor/principal investigator were assessed using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys with closed- and open-ended responses as well as focus group interviews. Balancing stakeholder interests is key to creating a sustainable program with widespread support; hence, the level of support from internship hosts and faculty members were key metrics analyzed throughout. We hypothesized that once a successful internship program was implemented, faculty culture might shift to be more accepting of internships; indeed, the data quantifying faculty attitudes support this. Furthermore, host motivation and performance expectations of interns were compared with results achieved, and this data revealed both expected and surprising benefits to hosts. Data suggests a myriad of benefits for each stakeholder group, and themes are cataloged and discussed. Program outcomes, evaluation data, policies, resources, and best practices developed through the implementation of this program are shared to provide resources that facilitate the creation of similar internship programs at other institutions. Program development was initially spurred by National Institutes of Health pilot funding, thereafter, successfully transitioning from a grant-supported model, to an institutionally supported funding model to achieve long-term programmatic sustainability.\nUnreviewed science in the news: The evolution of preprint media coverage from 2014-2021\nAuthors: Fleerackers, A.; Shores, K.; Chtena, N.; Alperin, J. P.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548392\nIt has been argued that preprint coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a paradigm shift in journalism norms and practices. This study examines whether, in what ways, and to what extent this is the case using a sample of 11,538 preprints posted on four preprint servers--bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN--that received coverage in 94 English-language media outlets between 2014-2021. We compared mentions of these preprints with mentions of a comparison sample of 397,446 peer reviewed research articles indexed in the Web of Science to identify changes in the share of media coverage that mentioned preprints before and during the pandemic. We found that preprint media coverage increased at a slow but steady rate pre-pandemic, then spiked dramatically. This increase applied only to COVID-19-related preprints, with minimal or no change in coverage of preprints on other topics. In addition, the rise in preprint coverage was most pronounced among health and medicine-focused media outlets, which barely covered preprints before the pandemic but mentioned more COVID-19 preprints than outlets focused on any other topic. These results suggest that the growth in coverage of preprints seen during the pandemic period may imply a shift in journalistic norms, including a changing outlook on reporting preliminary, unvetted research.\nPurchases dominate the carbon footprint of research laboratories\nAuthors: De Paepe, M.; Jeanneau, L.; Mariette, J.; Aumont, O.; Estevez-Torres, A.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.04.535626\nDespite increasing interest for the carbon footprint of higher education institutions, little is known about the carbon footprint associated to research activities. Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroe-conomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assesments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO2e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO2e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 {+/-} 0.07 kg CO2e/{euro} and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to -20 % in total emissions (-40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes. Significance statementResearch activities are recently interrogating their contribution to global warming, mainly through the impact of air travel but neglecting the emissions embodied in scientific purchases. However, goods and services used in a research laboratory emit greenhouse gases when they are produced. Here we construct a public and robust database of emission factors to quantify purchases emissions in a laboratory and we use it to assess emissions from a hundred of laboratories in France, from all disciplines. We find that purchases emissions represent half of the of the 6.3 t CO2e/pers per year emitted on average per laboratory. Emissions, however, vary greatly between laboratories and disciplines and an analysis of mitigation strategies shows that decreasing demand may significantly reduce purchases emissions.\nWhen Citizen Science meets teaching: A storified citizen science computer game to teach and contribute to genomic data analysis\nAuthors: Drogaris, C.; Butyaev, A.; Nazarova, E.; Sarrazin-Gendron, R.; Patel, H.; Singh, A.; Kadota, B.; Waldispuhl, J.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2022.05.23.492810\nIn the last decade, video games became a common vehicle for citizen science initiatives in life science, allowing participants to contribute to real scientific data analysis while learning about it. Since 2010, our scientific discovery game (SDG) Phylo enlists participants in comparative genomic data analysis. It is frequently used as a learning tool, but the activities were difficult to aggregate to build a coherent teaching activity. Here, we describe a strategy and series of recipes to facilitate the integration of SDGs in courses and implement this approach in Phylo. We developed new roles and functionalities enabling instructors to create assignments and monitor the progress of students. A story mode progressively introduces comparative genomics concepts, allowing users to learn and contribute to the analysis of real genomic sequences. Preliminary results from a user study suggest this framework may help to boost user motivation and clarify pedagogical objectives.\nMaking Biomedical Research Software FAIR: Actionable Step-by-step Guidelines with a User-support Tool\nAuthors: Patel, B.; Soundarajan, S.; Menager, H.; Hu, Z.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2022.04.18.488694\nFindable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles tailored for research software have been proposed by the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group. They provide a foundation for optimizing the reuse of research software. The FAIR4RS principles are, however, aspirational and do not provide practical instructions to the researchers. To fill this gap, we propose in this work the first actionable step-by-step guidelines for biomedical researchers to make their research software compliant with the FAIR4RS principles. We designate them as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines. Our process for developing these guidelines, presented here, is based on an in-depth study of the FAIR4RS principles and a thorough review of current practices in the field. To support researchers, we have also developed a workflow that streamlines the process of implementing these guidelines. This workflow is incorporated in FAIRshare, a free and open-source software application aimed at simplifying the curation and sharing of FAIR biomedical data and software through user-friendly interfaces and automation. Details about this tool are also presented.\nA Hypothesis-Based Hop Microbiology Laboratory Module Testing the Plausibility of the Mythical Origin of the India Pale Ale (IPA)\nAuthors: Pineda, J. M.; Scholes, A. N.; Lewis, J. A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550083\nAs one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. This analysis found high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Furthermore, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, suggesting a gender disparity in academic publishing. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in identifying areas of concern in scientific peer review and underscores the need to enhance transparency and objectivity in the scientific publishing process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Engaging in undergraduate research experiences is known to have broad and positive impacts on college students. Despite the benefits, achieving faculty buy-in and support can be challenging even when faculty have strong research funding. In order to understand how to better support undergraduate research programs, we applied quantitative models to explore how the impact of research funding is mediated by faculty beliefs about undergraduate research mentoring in STEM disciplines. The results indicate that faculty characteristics and beliefs about the benefits and barriers of mentoring undergraduate students in research impact the number of students mentored even when accounting for research funding levels of the individual faculty. Practical recommendations are presented based on the models from this research project in order to provide insight into how centers or units on a campus may work with faculty to support and encourage mentoring of undergraduates in research in the biomedical sciences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mathematical models for shell morphology have been well-studied in theoretical morphology. The growing tube model proposed by Takashi Okamoto was developed to reproduce heteromorph ammonoids and can generate various shells by changing three parameters: curvature, torsion, and enlarging ratio. Previous studies in theoretical morphology have employed computers to visualize mathematical models. However, computers are not accessible to everyone, and merely observing the graphics of the reproduced shells does not deepen understanding of the mathematical model. Therefore, in this study, we considered using origami, which is inexpensive and readily available, to make users understand mathematical models through hands-on folding. First, we simplified the crease pattern of seashells, originally devised by an origami artist Tomoko Fuse, to create a basic crease pattern. We then identified the crease pattern elements corresponding to the three parameters in the growing tube model and the aperture-apex position determiner. Based on them, we reproduced various shell shapes, including a heteromorph-ammonoid-like shape, with origami. Finally, we investigated the constraints between parameters in the origami-growing tube model. The origami-growing tube model is expected to help disseminate mathematical models and promote theoretical biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The introduction of internet-connected technologies to the classroom has the potential to revolutionize STEM education by allowing students to perform experiments in complex models that are unattainable in traditional teaching laboratories. By connecting laboratory equipment to the cloud, we introduce students to experimentation in pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids in two different settings: Using microscopy to monitor organoid growth in an introductory tissue culture course, and using high density multielectrode arrays to perform neuronal stimulation and recording in an advanced neuroscience mathematics course. We demonstrate that this approach develops interest in stem cell and neuroscience in the students of both courses. All together, we propose cloud technologies as an effective and scalable approach for complex project-based university training.

HIGHLIGHTS- Development of cortical organoids as pedagogical tools for undergraduate education.
- Organoids implemented in a tissue culture course through cloud-enabled microscopy.
- Multielectrode arrays allow for live organoid manipulation in a mathematics course.
- Students self-report increased interest in neuroscience and stem cells topics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A doctoral-level internship program was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the intent to create customizable experiential learning opportunities for biomedical trainees to support career exploration, preparation, and transition into their post-graduate professional roles. We report the outcomes of this program over a five-year period. During that 5-year period, 123 internships took place at over 70 partner sites, representing at least 20 academic, for-profit, and non-profit career paths in the life sciences. A major goal of the program was to enhance trainees skill development and expertise in careers of interest. The benefits of the internship program for interns, host/employer, and supervisor/principal investigator were assessed using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys with closed- and open-ended responses as well as focus group interviews. Balancing stakeholder interests is key to creating a sustainable program with widespread support; hence, the level of support from internship hosts and faculty members were key metrics analyzed throughout. We hypothesized that once a successful internship program was implemented, faculty culture might shift to be more accepting of internships; indeed, the data quantifying faculty attitudes support this. Furthermore, host motivation and performance expectations of interns were compared with results achieved, and this data revealed both expected and surprising benefits to hosts. Data suggests a myriad of benefits for each stakeholder group, and themes are cataloged and discussed. Program outcomes, evaluation data, policies, resources, and best practices developed through the implementation of this program are shared to provide resources that facilitate the creation of similar internship programs at other institutions. Program development was initially spurred by National Institutes of Health pilot funding, thereafter, successfully transitioning from a grant-supported model, to an institutionally supported funding model to achieve long-term programmatic sustainability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It has been argued that preprint coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a paradigm shift in journalism norms and practices. This study examines whether, in what ways, and to what extent this is the case using a sample of 11,538 preprints posted on four preprint servers--bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN--that received coverage in 94 English-language media outlets between 2014-2021. We compared mentions of these preprints with mentions of a comparison sample of 397,446 peer reviewed research articles indexed in the Web of Science to identify changes in the share of media coverage that mentioned preprints before and during the pandemic. We found that preprint media coverage increased at a slow but steady rate pre-pandemic, then spiked dramatically. This increase applied only to COVID-19-related preprints, with minimal or no change in coverage of preprints on other topics. In addition, the rise in preprint coverage was most pronounced among health and medicine-focused media outlets, which barely covered preprints before the pandemic but mentioned more COVID-19 preprints than outlets focused on any other topic. These results suggest that the growth in coverage of preprints seen during the pandemic period may imply a shift in journalistic norms, including a changing outlook on reporting preliminary, unvetted research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite increasing interest for the carbon footprint of higher education institutions, little is known about the carbon footprint associated to research activities. Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroe-conomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assesments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO2e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO2e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 {&#43;/-} 0.07 kg CO2e/{euro} and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to -20 % in total emissions (-40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes.

Significance statementResearch activities are recently interrogating their contribution to global warming, mainly through the impact of air travel but neglecting the emissions embodied in scientific purchases. However, goods and services used in a research laboratory emit greenhouse gases when they are produced. Here we construct a public and robust database of emission factors to quantify purchases emissions in a laboratory and we use it to assess emissions from a hundred of laboratories in France, from all disciplines. We find that purchases emissions represent half of the of the 6.3 t CO2e/pers per year emitted on average per laboratory. Emissions, however, vary greatly between laboratories and disciplines and an analysis of mitigation strategies shows that decreasing demand may significantly reduce purchases emissions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the last decade, video games became a common vehicle for citizen science initiatives in life science, allowing participants to contribute to real scientific data analysis while learning about it. Since 2010, our scientific discovery game (SDG) Phylo enlists participants in comparative genomic data analysis. It is frequently used as a learning tool, but the activities were difficult to aggregate to build a coherent teaching activity. Here, we describe a strategy and series of recipes to facilitate the integration of SDGs in courses and implement this approach in Phylo. We developed new roles and functionalities enabling instructors to create assignments and monitor the progress of students. A story mode progressively introduces comparative genomics concepts, allowing users to learn and contribute to the analysis of real genomic sequences. Preliminary results from a user study suggest this framework may help to boost user motivation and clarify pedagogical objectives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles tailored for research software have been proposed by the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group. They provide a foundation for optimizing the reuse of research software. The FAIR4RS principles are, however, aspirational and do not provide practical instructions to the researchers. To fill this gap, we propose in this work the first actionable step-by-step guidelines for biomedical researchers to make their research software compliant with the FAIR4RS principles. We designate them as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines. Our process for developing these guidelines, presented here, is based on an in-depth study of the FAIR4RS principles and a thorough review of current practices in the field. To support researchers, we have also developed a workflow that streamlines the process of implementing these guidelines. This workflow is incorporated in FAIRshare, a free and open-source software application aimed at simplifying the curation and sharing of FAIR biomedical data and software through user-friendly interfaces and automation. Details about this tool are also presented.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.</p>
