Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a variety of contexts in medicine.

  "articleBody": " Medical Students' Attitudes toward AI in Medicine and their Expectations for Medical Education\nAuthors: Kimmerle, J.; Timm, J.; Festl-Wietek, T.; Cress, U.; Herrmann-Werner, A.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292877\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is used in a variety of contexts in medicine. This involves the use of algorithms and software that analyze digital information to make diagnoses and suggest adapted therapies. It is unclear, however, what medical students know about AI in medicine, how they evaluate its application, and what they expect from their medical training accordingly. In the study presented here, we asked medical students about their assessment of AI in medicine and recorded their ideas and suggestions for considering this topic in medical education. Fifty-eight medical students took part in the survey. Almost all participants were aware of the use of AI in medicine and had an adequate understanding of it. They perceived AI in medicine to be reliable, trustworthy, and technically competent, but not particularly credible. They considered AI in medicine to be rather intelligent but not anthropomorphic. Participants were interested in the opportunities of AI in the medical context and wanted to learn more about it. They indicated that basic AI knowledge should be taught in medical studies, in particular, knowledge about modes of operation, ethics, areas of application, reliability, and possible risks. We discuss the implications of these findings for the curricular development in medical education. Medical students need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to use AI effectively and ethically in their future practice. This includes understanding the limitations and potential biases of AI algorithms by teaching the sensible use of human oversight and continuous monitoring to catch errors in AI algorithms and ensure that final decisions are made by human clinicians.\nInternational perspective on physician knowledge, attitude and practices related to medical cannabis.\nAuthors: Syed, S.; Singh, J.; Elkholy, H.; Rojnic Palavra, I.; Tomicevic, M.; Petek Eric, A.; Pinto da Costa, M.; Guloksuz, S.; Radhakrishnan, R.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293157\nBackgroundThe trends of recreational use of cannabis and use of cannabis for medical indications (i.e. \"medical cannabis\") have grown in recent years. Despite that, there is still limited scientific evidence to guide clinical decision-making and the strength of evidence for the medical use of cannabis is currently considered to be low. In contrast, theres growing evidence for negative health outcomes related to use of cannabis. In this rapidly shifting landscape, the role of physicians attitudes regarding the therapeutic value of cannabis has become essential. This study aimed to characterize knowledge/experience, attitudes, and potential predictors of clinical practice regarding medical cannabis. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of physicians from 17 countries between 2016-2018. The survey comprised of 28 questions designed to explore physician knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use of medical cannabis. Descriptive statistics were used to examine willingness to recommend medical cannabis for medical and psychiatric indications, followed by regression analysis to identify predictors of physician willingness to recommend medical cannabis. ResultsA total of 323 physicians responded to the survey. Mean age was 35.4{+/-} 9.5 years, with 10.04 {+/-}8.6 years of clinical experience. 53 percent of physicians were women. Clinical experience with medical cannabis was overall limited (51.4% noted never having recommended medical cannabis; 33% noted inadequate knowledge regarding medical cannabis). Overall willingness to recommend medical cannabis was highest for chemotherapy-induced nausea, refractory chronic neuropathic pain, and spasticity in amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ConclusionThis international study examining knowledge, attitudes and practices related to medical cannabis among physicians revealed that there are significant gaps in domain-specific knowledge related to medical cannabis. There is wide variability in willingness to recommend medical cannabis that is not consistent with the current strength of evidence. This study thus highlights the need for greater education related to domain-specific knowledge about medical cannabis.\n",
