  "articleBody": " Medical students' perceptions towards artificial intelligence in education and practice: A multinational, multicenter cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Busch, F.; Hoffmann, L.; Truhn, D.; Ortiz-Prado, E.; Makowski, M. R.; Bressem, K. K.; Adams, L. C.; COMFORT Consortium, Score: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.09.23299744\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to fundamentally change the educational and professional landscape for the next generation of physicians, but its successful integration depends on the global perspectives of all stakeholders. Previous medical student surveys were limited by small sample sizes or geographic constraints, hindering a global comparison of perceptions. This study aims to explore current medical students attitudes towards AI in medical education and the profession on a broad, international scale and to examine regional differences in perspectives. Methods and FindingsThis international multicenter cross-sectional study developed and validated an anonymous online survey of 15 multiple-choice items to assess medical, dentistry, and veterinary students AI knowledge and attitudes toward the utilization of AI in healthcare, the current state of AI education, and regional differences in perspectives. Between April and October 2023, 4,313 medical, 205 dentistry, and 78 veterinary students from 192 faculties in 48 countries responded to the survey (average response rate: 0.2%, standard deviation: 0.4%). Most participants studied in European countries (N=2,350), followed by North/South America (N=1,070) and Asia (N=944). Students expressed predominantly positive attitudes towards the use of AI in healthcare (67.6%, N=3,091) and the desire for more AI teaching in their curricula (76.1%, N=3,474). However, they reported limited general knowledge of AI (75.3%, N=3,451), the absence of AI-related courses (76.3%, N=3,497), and felt inadequately prepared to use AI in their future careers (57.9%, N=2,652). The subgroup analyses revealed regional differences in perceptions, although predominantly with small effect sizes. The main limitations include the low response rate per institution, which was calculated on total enrollment across all degree programs, and the risk of selection bias. ConclusionsThis study highlights the favorable perceptions of international medical students towards incorporating AI in healthcare practice while emphasizing the importance of integrating AI teaching into medical education.

DesignCross-sectional, anonymous online survey of UK medical students using a non-random sampling method. SettingUK medical schools recognised by the General Medical Council. ParticipantsThe sample consisted of 132 medical students who had spent an average of 3.8 years (SD=1.4; range: 1 to 6) in medical school. ResultsMost students (83%) reported that they were aware of psychedelic research and only four participants (3%) said that they were not interested in learning more about this type of research. Although medical students harm assessment of psychedelics closely aligned with that of experts, only 17% of students felt well-educated on psychedelic research. Teachings on psychedelics were only rarely encountered in their curriculum. Time spent at medical schools was not associated with more knowledge about psychedelics. On average, this sample of medical students showed strong support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research into their potential clinical applications. Regression modelling indicated that greater knowledge of psychedelics, lower estimated harm scores, more time spent in medical school, and lower perceived effectiveness of nonpharmacological mental health treatments were associated with a support for legal status change. ConclusionsThis is the first study to explore UK medical students self-reported knowledge and attitudes towards psychedelics and their application in clinical research. Our findings reveal a significant interest among medical students to learn more about psychedelic research and a strong support for further psychedelic research. Future studies are needed to examine how medical education could be refined to adequately prepare medical students for a changing healthcare landscape in which psychedelic-assisted therapy could soon be implemented in clinical practice. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis study presents the first survey of UK medical students attitudes towards psychedelics and their application in clinical research. C_LIO_LIThe wide-ranging assessment included medical students self-reported knowledge of psychedelics, a multidimensional harm assessment of psychedelics, level of support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research into their potential clinical applications, and students perceptions of medical education on psychedelics and psychedelic research. C_LIO_LIThe cross-sectional nature of our data prevented us from drawing causal conclusions about potential changes in students attitudes and knowledge over time. C_LIO_LIThe limited range of demographic variables did not allow for an in-depth characterisation of this sample and important predictors of attitudes might have been missed. Non-random sampling and selection bias could have impacted the generalisability of our findings as students already interested in drugs might have been more likely to participate. C_LI\nAssessing the Ability of GPT to Generate Illness Scripts: An Evaluation Study\nAuthors: Yanagita, Y.; Yokokawa, D.; Fukuzawa, F.; Uchida, S.; Uehara, T.; Ikusaka, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.23300525\nBackgroundIllness scripts, which are structured summaries of clinical knowledge concerning diseases, are crucial in disease prediction and problem representation during clinical reasoning. Clinicians iteratively enhance their illness scripts through their clinical practice. Because illness scripts are unique to each physician, no systematic summary of specific examples of illness scripts has been reported. ObjectiveGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as an educational aid in continuing medical education. The effortless creation of a typical illness script by generative AI could enhance the comprehension of disease concepts and increase diagnostic accuracy. This study investigated whether generative AI possesses the capability to generate illness scripts. MethodsWe used ChatGPT, a generative AI, to create illness scripts for 184 diseases based on the diseases and conditions integral to the National Model Core Curriculum for undergraduate medical education (2022 revised edition) and primary care specialist training in Japan. Three physicians applied a three-tier grading scale: \"A\" if the content of each diseases illness script proves sufficient for training medical students, \"B\" if it is partially lacking but acceptable, and \"C\" if it is deficient in multiple respects. Moreover, any identified deficiencies in the illness scripts were discussed during the evaluation process. ResultsLeveraging ChatGPT, we successfully generated each component of the illness script for 184 diseases without any omission. The illness scripts received \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" ratings of 56.0% (103/184), 28.3% (52/184), and 15.8% (29/184), respectively. ConclusionUseful illness scripts were seamlessly and instantaneously created by ChatGPT using prompts appropriate for medical students. The technology-driven illness script is a valuable tool for introducing medical students to disease conceptualization.\nA Scoping Review of Deaf Awareness Programs in Health Professional Education\nAuthors: Terry, J.; Meara, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23300560\nDeaf awareness aims to promote understanding about Deaf and hard of hearing people, with the goal of reducing barriers between Deaf and hearing populations; and is particularly pertinent for health professional students as they need to learn to communicate effectively with a range of population groups. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of literature examining Deaf awareness programs provided to health professional students during their initial training. We searched four medical and public health databases and registers using terms related to Deaf awareness. We used the PRISMA-ScR reporting standards checklist for scoping reviews. We identified 10,198 citations, with 15 studies included in the final review. Searches were performed during August to September 2022, and April 2023. Studies were included provided they examined Deaf awareness content or programs within health professional education. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers who screened all abstracts using Rayyan software, followed by discussion to achieve knowledge synthesis and agreement. In all, a total of 15 articles from six countries were identified across health professional student disciplines including pharmacy, nursing, audiology, inter-professional and medical programs. The review found sparse evidence of research into Deaf awareness programs delivered to health professional students, with delivery often solely to small groups of students, indicating why so few students can access information about how to communicate effectively with Deaf and hard of hearing patients during their initial training programs. This scoping reviewed showed evidence of promising benefits for health professional students undertaking Deaf and hard of hearing awareness programs during their undergraduate education. The importance of communicating with Deaf and hard of hearing patients and attaining Deaf cultural competencies for health professional students should be investigated in future research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo capture UK medical students self-reported knowledge and harm assessment of psychedelics and to explore the factors associated with support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research.

DesignCross-sectional, anonymous online survey of UK medical students using a non-random sampling method.

SettingUK medical schools recognised by the General Medical Council.

ParticipantsThe sample consisted of 132 medical students who had spent an average of 3.8 years (SD=1.4; range: 1 to 6) in medical school.

ResultsMost students (83%) reported that they were aware of psychedelic research and only four participants (3%) said that they were not interested in learning more about this type of research. Although medical students harm assessment of psychedelics closely aligned with that of experts, only 17% of students felt well-educated on psychedelic research. Teachings on psychedelics were only rarely encountered in their curriculum. Time spent at medical schools was not associated with more knowledge about psychedelics. On average, this sample of medical students showed strong support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research into their potential clinical applications. Regression modelling indicated that greater knowledge of psychedelics, lower estimated harm scores, more time spent in medical school, and lower perceived effectiveness of nonpharmacological mental health treatments were associated with a support for legal status change.

ConclusionsThis is the first study to explore UK medical students self-reported knowledge and attitudes towards psychedelics and their application in clinical research. Our findings reveal a significant interest among medical students to learn more about psychedelic research and a strong support for further psychedelic research. Future studies are needed to examine how medical education could be refined to adequately prepare medical students for a changing healthcare landscape in which psychedelic-assisted therapy could soon be implemented in clinical practice.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis study presents the first survey of UK medical students attitudes towards psychedelics and their application in clinical research.
C_LIO_LIThe wide-ranging assessment included medical students self-reported knowledge of psychedelics, a multidimensional harm assessment of psychedelics, level of support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research into their potential clinical applications, and students perceptions of medical education on psychedelics and psychedelic research.
C_LIO_LIThe cross-sectional nature of our data prevented us from drawing causal conclusions about potential changes in students attitudes and knowledge over time.
C_LIO_LIThe limited range of demographic variables did not allow for an in-depth characterisation of this sample and important predictors of attitudes might have been missed. Non-random sampling and selection bias could have impacted the generalisability of our findings as students already interested in drugs might have been more likely to participate.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIllness scripts, which are structured summaries of clinical knowledge concerning diseases, are crucial in disease prediction and problem representation during clinical reasoning. Clinicians iteratively enhance their illness scripts through their clinical practice. Because illness scripts are unique to each physician, no systematic summary of specific examples of illness scripts has been reported.

ObjectiveGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as an educational aid in continuing medical education. The effortless creation of a typical illness script by generative AI could enhance the comprehension of disease concepts and increase diagnostic accuracy. This study investigated whether generative AI possesses the capability to generate illness scripts.

MethodsWe used ChatGPT, a generative AI, to create illness scripts for 184 diseases based on the diseases and conditions integral to the National Model Core Curriculum for undergraduate medical education (2022 revised edition) and primary care specialist training in Japan. Three physicians applied a three-tier grading scale: &#34;A&#34; if the content of each diseases illness script proves sufficient for training medical students, &#34;B&#34; if it is partially lacking but acceptable, and &#34;C&#34; if it is deficient in multiple respects. Moreover, any identified deficiencies in the illness scripts were discussed during the evaluation process.

ResultsLeveraging ChatGPT, we successfully generated each component of the illness script for 184 diseases without any omission. The illness scripts received &#34;A,&#34; &#34;B,&#34; and &#34;C&#34; ratings of 56.0% (103/184), 28.3% (52/184), and 15.8% (29/184), respectively.

ConclusionUseful illness scripts were seamlessly and instantaneously created by ChatGPT using prompts appropriate for medical students. The technology-driven illness script is a valuable tool for introducing medical students to disease conceptualization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deaf awareness aims to promote understanding about Deaf and hard of hearing people, with the goal of reducing barriers between Deaf and hearing populations; and is particularly pertinent for health professional students as they need to learn to communicate effectively with a range of population groups. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of literature examining Deaf awareness programs provided to health professional students during their initial training. We searched four medical and public health databases and registers using terms related to Deaf awareness. We used the PRISMA-ScR reporting standards checklist for scoping reviews. We identified 10,198 citations, with 15 studies included in the final review. Searches were performed during August to September 2022, and April 2023. Studies were included provided they examined Deaf awareness content or programs within health professional education. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers who screened all abstracts using Rayyan software, followed by discussion to achieve knowledge synthesis and agreement. In all, a total of 15 articles from six countries were identified across health professional student disciplines including pharmacy, nursing, audiology, inter-professional and medical programs. The review found sparse evidence of research into Deaf awareness programs delivered to health professional students, with delivery often solely to small groups of students, indicating why so few students can access information about how to communicate effectively with Deaf and hard of hearing patients during their initial training programs. This scoping reviewed showed evidence of promising benefits for health professional students undertaking Deaf and hard of hearing awareness programs during their undergraduate education. The importance of communicating with Deaf and hard of hearing patients and attaining Deaf cultural competencies for health professional students should be investigated in future research.</p>
