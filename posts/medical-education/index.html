  "articleBody": " Medical students' perceptions towards artificial intelligence in education and practice: A multinational, multicenter cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Busch, F.; Hoffmann, L.; Truhn, D.; Ortiz-Prado, E.; Makowski, M. R.; Bressem, K. K.; Adams, L. C.; COMFORT Consortium, Score: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.09.23299744\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to fundamentally change the educational and professional landscape for the next generation of physicians, but its successful integration depends on the global perspectives of all stakeholders. Previous medical student surveys were limited by small sample sizes or geographic constraints, hindering a global comparison of perceptions. This study aims to explore current medical students attitudes towards AI in medical education and the profession on a broad, international scale and to examine regional differences in perspectives. Methods and FindingsThis international multicenter cross-sectional study developed and validated an anonymous online survey of 15 multiple-choice items to assess medical, dentistry, and veterinary students AI knowledge and attitudes toward the utilization of AI in healthcare, the current state of AI education, and regional differences in perspectives. Between April and October 2023, 4,313 medical, 205 dentistry, and 78 veterinary students from 192 faculties in 48 countries responded to the survey (average response rate: 0.2%, standard deviation: 0.4%). Most participants studied in European countries (N=2,350), followed by North/South America (N=1,070) and Asia (N=944). Students expressed predominantly positive attitudes towards the use of AI in healthcare (67.6%, N=3,091) and the desire for more AI teaching in their curricula (76.1%, N=3,474). However, they reported limited general knowledge of AI (75.3%, N=3,451), the absence of AI-related courses (76.3%, N=3,497), and felt inadequately prepared to use AI in their future careers (57.9%, N=2,652). The subgroup analyses revealed regional differences in perceptions, although predominantly with small effect sizes. The main limitations include the low response rate per institution, which was calculated on total enrollment across all degree programs, and the risk of selection bias. ConclusionsThis study highlights the favorable perceptions of international medical students towards incorporating AI in healthcare practice while emphasizing the importance of integrating AI teaching into medical education.

Design: Cross-sectional, anonymous online survey of UK medical students using a non-random sampling method. Setting: UK medical schools recognised by the General Medical Council. Participants: The sample consisted of 132 medical students who had spent an average of 3.8 years (SD=1.4; range: 1 to 6) in medical school. Results: Most students (83%) reported that they were aware of psychedelic research and only four participants (3%) said that they were not interested in learning more about this type of research. Although medical students' harm assessment of psychedelics closely aligned with that of experts, only 17% of students felt well-educated on psychedelic research. Teachings on psychedelics were only rarely encountered in their curriculum. Time spent at medical schools was not associated with more knowledge about psychedelics. On average, this sample of medical students showed strong support for changing the legal status of psychedelics to facilitate further research into their potential clinical applications. Regression modelling indicated that greater knowledge of psychedelics, lower estimated harm scores, more time spent in medical school, and lower perceived effectiveness of nonpharmacological mental health treatments were associated with a support for legal status change. Conclusions: This is the first study to explore UK medical students' self-reported knowledge and attitudes towards psychedelics and their application in clinical research. Our findings reveal a significant interest among medical students to learn more about psychedelic research and a strong support for further psychedelic research. Future studies are needed to examine how medical education could be refined to adequately prepare medical students for a changing healthcare landscape in which psychedelic-assisted therapy could soon be implemented in clinical practice.\n",
