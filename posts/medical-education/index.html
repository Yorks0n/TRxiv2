3D printed, patient-specific anatomical models have been demonstrated as effective tools for preoperative training, especially in complex surgeries involving rare cases or unique anatomy. Current, state-of-the-art solutions are expensive, requiring 3D printers with large capital and operating costs, making them impractical for common usage and less likely to be adopted in healthcare settings.">

Current, state-of-the-art solutions are expensive, requiring 3D printers with large capital and operating costs, making them impractical for common usage and less likely to be adopted in healthcare settings. Alternatively, models fabricated using low-cost printing techniques, like fused filament fabrication (FFF), fail to achieve the utility of their more expensive counterparts. To overcome this challenge, we have developed an innovative approach using FFF that is able to partition the model into separate segments, held together with magnetic fasteners, to unveil the internal anatomy of the model thereby overcoming the challenges of low-cost printing methods and providing equivalent efficacy to the state-of-the-art. Notably, our models can be printed significantly faster and cheaper than other published models and can be viewed holistically as one model, or can be physically expanded into slices (like a deck of cards) whilst maintaining the entire model integrity. By dramatically reducing cost and time, our solution unlocks the potential of 3D printed patient specific models, making these practical for hospital usage.\nVirtual Simulated Placements in Healthcare Education: A scoping review\nAuthors: Samson, J.; Gilbey, M.; Taylor, N.; Kneafsey, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296932\nIntroductionA virtual simulated placement (VSP) is a computer-generated version of a practice placement.
