Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains as an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system. By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment. In addition, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus was also impaired after infection. Therefore, cerebrovascular and choroid plexus dysfunctions are important aspects of COVID-19 and may contribute to the neurological complications both acutely and in long COVID.\nGeneration of surrogate brain maps preserving spatial autocorrelation through random rotation of geometric eigenmodes\nAuthors: Koussis, N. C.; Pang, J. C.; Jeganathan, J.; Paton, B.; Fornito, A.; Robinson, P. A.; Misic, B.; Breakspear, M.\nScore: 46.6, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579070\nThe brain expresses activity in complex spatiotemporal patterns, reflected in the influence of spatially distributed cytoarchitectural, biochemical, and genetic properties. The correspondence between these multimodal \"brain maps\" may reflect underlying causal pathways and is hence a topic of substantial interest. However, these maps possess intrinsic smoothness (spatial autocorrelation, SA) which can inflate spurious cross-correlations, leading to false positive associations. Identifying true associations requires knowledge about the distribution of correlations that arise by chance in the presence of SA. This null distribution can be generated from an ensemble of surrogate brain maps that preserve the intrinsic SA but break the correlations between maps. The present work introduces the \"eigenstrapping\" method, which uses a spectral decomposition of cortical and subcortical surfaces in terms of geometric eigenmodes, and then randomly rotating these modes to produce SA-preserving surrogate brain maps. It is shown that these surrogates appropriately represent the null distribution of chance pairwise correlations, with similar or superior false positive control to current state-of-the-art procedures. Eigenstrapping is fast, eschews the need for parametric assumptions about the nature of a maps SA, and works with maps defined on smooth surfaces with or without a boundary. Moreover, it generalizes to broader classes of null models than existing techniques, offering a unified approach for inference on cortical and subcortical maps, spatiotemporal processes, and complex patterns possessing higher-order correlations.\nMost axonal mitochondria in cortical pyramidal neuronslack mitochondrial DNA and consume ATP\nAuthors: Hirabayashi, Y.; Lewis, T. L.; Du, Y.; Virga, D. M.; Decker, A.; Coceano, G.; Alvelid, J.; Paul, M.; Hamilton, S.; Kneis, P.; Takahashi, Y.; Gaublomme, J.; Testa, I.; Polleux, F.\nScore: 38.9, Published: 2024-02-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.579972\nIn neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), axonal mitochondria are thought to be indispensable for supplying ATP during energy-consuming processes such as neurotransmitter release. Here, we demonstrate using multiple, independent, in vitro and in vivo approaches that the majority (~80-90%) of axonal mitochondria in cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs), lack mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using dynamic, optical imaging analysis of genetically encoded sensors for mitochondrial matrix ATP and pH, we demonstrate that in axons of CPNs, but not in their dendrites, mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthase) functions in a reverse way, consuming ATP and protruding H+ out of the matrix to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results demonstrate that in mammalian CPNs, axonal mitochondria do not play a major role in ATP supply, despite playing other functions critical to regulating neurotransmission such as Ca2+ buffering.\nA next-generation, histological atlas of the human brain and its application to automated brain MRI segmentation\nAuthors: Casamitjana, A.; Mancini, M.; Robinson, E.; Peter, L.; Annunziata, R.; Althonayan, J.; Crampsie, S.; Blackburn, E.; Billot, B.; Atzeni, A.; Puonti, O.; Balbastre, Y.; Schmidt, P.; Hughes, J.; Augustinack, J.; Edlow, B. L.; Zollei, L.; Thomas, D.; Kliemann, D.; Bocchetta, M.; Strand, C.; Holton, J.; Jaunmuktane, Z.; Iglesias, J. E.\nScore: 35.8, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.579016\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard tool to image the human brain in vivo. In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [3], BigBrain [4], Julich [5]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain, a next-generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct [~]10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes, as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build an atlas with probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of brain ageing based on [~]4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool), probabilistic atlas, and segmentation tool. By enabling researchers worldwide to analyse brain MRI scans at a superior level of granularity without manual effort or highly specific neuroanatomical knowledge, NextBrain will accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.\nHippocampal sequences span experience relative to rewards\nAuthors: Sosa, M.; Plitt, M. H.; Giocomo, L. M.\nScore: 37.3, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573490\nHippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.\nA nociceptive amygdala-striatal pathway for chronic pain aversion\nAuthors: Wojick, J. A.; Paranjapye, A.; Chiu, J. K.; Mahmood, M.; Oswell, C.; Kimmey, B. A.; Wooldridge, L. M.; McCall, N. M.; Han, A.; Ejoh, L. L.; Chehimi, S. N.; Crist, R. C.; Reiner, B. C.; Korb, E.; Corder, G.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2024-02-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.579947\nThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) is essential for assigning positive or negative valence to sensory stimuli. Noxious stimuli that cause pain are encoded by an ensemble of nociceptive BLA projection neurons (BLAnoci ensemble). However, the role of the BLAnoci ensemble in mediating behavior changes and the molecular signatures and downstream targets distinguishing this ensemble remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the same BLAnoci ensemble neurons are required for both acute and chronic neuropathic pain behavior. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, we characterized the effect of acute and chronic pain on the BLA and identified enrichment for genes with known functions in axonal and synaptic organization and pain perception. We thus examined the brain-wide targets of the BLAnoci ensemble and uncovered a previously undescribed nociceptive hotspot of the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) that mirrors the stability and specificity of the BLAnoci ensemble and is recruited in chronic pain. Notably, BLAnoci ensemble axons transmit acute and neuropathic nociceptive information to the NAcSh, highlighting this nociceptive amygdala-striatal circuit as a unique pathway for affective-motivational responses across pain states.\nDopamine and DBS accelerate the neural dynamics of volitional action in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Köhler, R. M.; Binns, T. S.; Merk, T.; Zhu, G.; Yin, Z.; Zhao, B.; Chikermane, M.; Vanhoecke, J.; Busch, J. L.; Habets, J. G. V.; Faust, K.; Schneider, G.-H.; Cavallo, A.; Haufe, S.; Zhang, J.; Kühn, A. A.; Haynes, J.-D.; Neumann, W.-J.\nScore: 26.0, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564700\nThe ability to initiate volitional action is fundamental to human behaviour. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease is associated with impaired action initiation, also termed akinesia. Both dopamine and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate akinesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. An important question is whether dopamine and DBS facilitate de novo build-up of neural dynamics for motor execution or accelerate existing cortical movement initiation signals through shared modulatory circuit effects. Answering these questions can provide the foundation for new closed-loop neurotherapies with adaptive DBS, but the objectification of neural processing delays prior to performance of volitional action remains a significant challenge. To overcome this challenge, we studied readiness potentials and trained brain signal decoders on invasive neurophysiology signals in 25 DBS patients (12 female) with Parkinsons disease during performance of self-initiated movements. Combined sensorimotor cortex electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed OFF therapy (N=22), ON dopaminergic medication (N=18) and ON subthalamic deep brain stimulation (N=8). This allowed us to compare their therapeutic effects on neural latencies between the earliest cortical representation of movement intention as decoded by linear discriminant analysis classifiers and onset of muscle activation recorded with electromyography (EMG). In the hypodopaminergic OFF state, we observed long latencies between motor intention and motor execution for readiness potentials and machine learning classifications. Both, dopamine and DBS significantly shortened these latencies, hinting towards a shared therapeutic mechanism for alleviation of akinesia. To investigate this further, we analysed directional cortico-subthalamic oscillatory communication with multivariate granger causality. Strikingly, we found that both therapies independently shifted cortico-subthalamic oscillatory information flow from antikinetic beta (13-35 Hz) to prokinetic theta (4-10 Hz) rhythms, which was correlated with latencies in motor execution. Our study reveals a shared brain network modulation pattern of dopamine and DBS that may underlie the acceleration of neural dynamics for augmentation of movement initiation in Parkinsons disease. Instead of producing or increasing preparatory brain signals, both therapies modulate oscillatory communication. These insights provide a link between the pathophysiology of akinesia and its therapeutic alleviation with oscillatory network changes in other non-motor and motor domains, e.g. related to hyperkinesia or effort and reward perception. In the future, our study may inspire the development of clinical brain computer interfaces based on brain signal decoders to provide temporally precise support for action initiation in patients with brain disorders.\nIdentifying Interpretable Latent Factors with Sparse Component Analysis\nAuthors: Zimnik, A. J.; Ames, K. C.; An, X.; Driscoll, L.; Lara, A. H.; Russo, A. A.; Susoy, V.; Cunningham, J. P.; Paninski, L.; Churchland, M. M.; Glaser, J. I.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578988\nIn many neural populations, the computationally relevant signals are posited to be a set of latent factors - signals shared across many individual neurons. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and behavior requires the identification of factors that reflect distinct computational roles. Methods for identifying such factors typically require supervision, which can be suboptimal if one is unsure how (or whether) factors can be grouped into distinct, meaningful sets. Here, we introduce Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), an unsupervised method that identifies interpretable latent factors. SCA seeks factors that are sparse in time and occupy orthogonal dimensions. With these simple constraints, SCA facilitates surprisingly clear parcellations of neural activity across a range of behaviors. We applied SCA to motor cortex activity from reaching and cycling monkeys, single-trial imaging data from C. elegans, and activity from a multitask artificial network. SCA consistently identified sets of factors that were useful in describing network computations.\nFunctional architecture of intracellular oscillations in hippocampal dendrites\nAuthors: Liao, Z.; Gonzalez, K. C.; Li, D.; Yang, C.; Holder, D.; McClain, N.; Zhang, G.; Evans, S.; Chavarha, M.; Yi, J.; Makinson, C.; Lin, M.; Losonczy, A.; Negrean, A.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.579750\nFast electrical signaling in dendrites is central to neural computations that support adaptive behaviors. Conventional techniques lack temporal and spatial resolution and the ability to track underlying membrane potential dynamics present across the complex three-dimensional dendritic arbor in vivo. Here, we perform fast two-photon imaging of dendritic and somatic membrane potential dynamics in single pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus during awake behavior. We study the dynamics of subthreshold membrane potential and suprathreshold dendritic events throughout the dendritic arbor in vivo by combining voltage imaging with simultaneous local field potential recording, post hoc morphological reconstruction, and a spatial navigation task. We systematically quantify the modulation of local event rates by locomotion in distinct dendritic regions and report an advancing gradient of dendritic theta phase along the basal-tuft axis, then describe a predominant hyperpolarization of the dendritic arbor during sharp-wave ripples. Finally, we find spatial tuning of dendritic representations dynamically reorganizes following place field formation. Our data reveal how the organization of electrical signaling in dendrites maps onto the anatomy of the dendritic tree across behavior, oscillatory network, and functional cell states.\nMind the blank: behavioral, experiential, and physiological signatures of absent-mindedness\nAuthors: Musat, E. M.; Corcoran, A. W.; Belloli, L.; Naccache, L.; Andrillon, T.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.11.579845\nDoes being awake mean being conscious? This study investigates Mind Blanking (MB), characterized by an \"emptiness of mind\", comparing it with Mind Wandering (MW) and On-task (ON) states. Using a sustained attention task and electroencephalogram monitoring on 26 participants, behavioral and neurophysiological signatures of MB were examined. MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses also revealed decreased frontal-posterior connectivity during MB and event-related potentials indicated a disruption in late-stage visual processing, suggesting a lack of conscious access to sensory information during MB. EEG-based neural features enabled trial-level prediction of mental states, furnishing estimates of the fine-grained dynamics of consciousness beyond subjective reports. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of continuous wake consciousness, suggesting that MB represents genuine gaps in our stream of thoughts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and near 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains as an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system. By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment. In addition, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus was also impaired after infection. Therefore, cerebrovascular and choroid plexus dysfunctions are important aspects of COVID-19 and may contribute to the neurological complications both acutely and in long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brain expresses activity in complex spatiotemporal patterns, reflected in the influence of spatially distributed cytoarchitectural, biochemical, and genetic properties. The correspondence between these multimodal &#34;brain maps&#34; may reflect underlying causal pathways and is hence a topic of substantial interest. However, these maps possess intrinsic smoothness (spatial autocorrelation, SA) which can inflate spurious cross-correlations, leading to false positive associations. Identifying true associations requires knowledge about the distribution of correlations that arise by chance in the presence of SA. This null distribution can be generated from an ensemble of surrogate brain maps that preserve the intrinsic SA but break the correlations between maps. The present work introduces the &#34;eigenstrapping&#34; method, which uses a spectral decomposition of cortical and subcortical surfaces in terms of geometric eigenmodes, and then randomly rotating these modes to produce SA-preserving surrogate brain maps. It is shown that these surrogates appropriately represent the null distribution of chance pairwise correlations, with similar or superior false positive control to current state-of-the-art procedures. Eigenstrapping is fast, eschews the need for parametric assumptions about the nature of a maps SA, and works with maps defined on smooth surfaces with or without a boundary. Moreover, it generalizes to broader classes of null models than existing techniques, offering a unified approach for inference on cortical and subcortical maps, spatiotemporal processes, and complex patterns possessing higher-order correlations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), axonal mitochondria are thought to be indispensable for supplying ATP during energy-consuming processes such as neurotransmitter release. Here, we demonstrate using multiple, independent, in vitro and in vivo approaches that the majority (~80-90%) of axonal mitochondria in cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs), lack mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using dynamic, optical imaging analysis of genetically encoded sensors for mitochondrial matrix ATP and pH, we demonstrate that in axons of CPNs, but not in their dendrites, mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthase) functions in a reverse way, consuming ATP and protruding H&#43; out of the matrix to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results demonstrate that in mammalian CPNs, axonal mitochondria do not play a major role in ATP supply, despite playing other functions critical to regulating neurotransmission such as Ca2&#43; buffering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard tool to image the human brain in vivo. In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [3], BigBrain [4], Julich [5]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain, a next-generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct [~]10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes, as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build an atlas with probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of brain ageing based on [~]4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool), probabilistic atlas, and segmentation tool. By enabling researchers worldwide to analyse brain MRI scans at a superior level of granularity without manual effort or highly specific neuroanatomical knowledge, NextBrain will accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is essential for assigning positive or negative valence to sensory stimuli. Noxious stimuli that cause pain are encoded by an ensemble of nociceptive BLA projection neurons (BLAnoci ensemble). However, the role of the BLAnoci ensemble in mediating behavior changes and the molecular signatures and downstream targets distinguishing this ensemble remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the same BLAnoci ensemble neurons are required for both acute and chronic neuropathic pain behavior. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, we characterized the effect of acute and chronic pain on the BLA and identified enrichment for genes with known functions in axonal and synaptic organization and pain perception. We thus examined the brain-wide targets of the BLAnoci ensemble and uncovered a previously undescribed nociceptive hotspot of the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) that mirrors the stability and specificity of the BLAnoci ensemble and is recruited in chronic pain. Notably, BLAnoci ensemble axons transmit acute and neuropathic nociceptive information to the NAcSh, highlighting this nociceptive amygdala-striatal circuit as a unique pathway for affective-motivational responses across pain states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to initiate volitional action is fundamental to human behaviour. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease is associated with impaired action initiation, also termed akinesia. Both dopamine and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate akinesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. An important question is whether dopamine and DBS facilitate de novo build-up of neural dynamics for motor execution or accelerate existing cortical movement initiation signals through shared modulatory circuit effects. Answering these questions can provide the foundation for new closed-loop neurotherapies with adaptive DBS, but the objectification of neural processing delays prior to performance of volitional action remains a significant challenge.

To overcome this challenge, we studied readiness potentials and trained brain signal decoders on invasive neurophysiology signals in 25 DBS patients (12 female) with Parkinsons disease during performance of self-initiated movements. Combined sensorimotor cortex electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed OFF therapy (N=22), ON dopaminergic medication (N=18) and ON subthalamic deep brain stimulation (N=8). This allowed us to compare their therapeutic effects on neural latencies between the earliest cortical representation of movement intention as decoded by linear discriminant analysis classifiers and onset of muscle activation recorded with electromyography (EMG).

In the hypodopaminergic OFF state, we observed long latencies between motor intention and motor execution for readiness potentials and machine learning classifications. Both, dopamine and DBS significantly shortened these latencies, hinting towards a shared therapeutic mechanism for alleviation of akinesia. To investigate this further, we analysed directional cortico-subthalamic oscillatory communication with multivariate granger causality. Strikingly, we found that both therapies independently shifted cortico-subthalamic oscillatory information flow from antikinetic beta (13-35 Hz) to prokinetic theta (4-10 Hz) rhythms, which was correlated with latencies in motor execution.

Our study reveals a shared brain network modulation pattern of dopamine and DBS that may underlie the acceleration of neural dynamics for augmentation of movement initiation in Parkinsons disease. Instead of producing or increasing preparatory brain signals, both therapies modulate oscillatory communication. These insights provide a link between the pathophysiology of akinesia and its therapeutic alleviation with oscillatory network changes in other non-motor and motor domains, e.g. related to hyperkinesia or effort and reward perception. In the future, our study may inspire the development of clinical brain computer interfaces based on brain signal decoders to provide temporally precise support for action initiation in patients with brain disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In many neural populations, the computationally relevant signals are posited to be a set of  latent factors - signals shared across many individual neurons. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and behavior requires the identification of factors that reflect distinct computational roles. Methods for identifying such factors typically require supervision, which can be suboptimal if one is unsure how (or whether) factors can be grouped into distinct, meaningful sets. Here, we introduce Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), an unsupervised method that identifies interpretable latent factors. SCA seeks factors that are sparse in time and occupy orthogonal dimensions. With these simple constraints, SCA facilitates surprisingly clear parcellations of neural activity across a range of behaviors. We applied SCA to motor cortex activity from reaching and cycling monkeys, single-trial imaging data from C. elegans, and activity from a multitask artificial network. SCA consistently identified sets of factors that were useful in describing network computations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fast electrical signaling in dendrites is central to neural computations that support adaptive behaviors. Conventional techniques lack temporal and spatial resolution and the ability to track underlying membrane potential dynamics present across the complex three-dimensional dendritic arbor in vivo. Here, we perform fast two-photon imaging of dendritic and somatic membrane potential dynamics in single pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus during awake behavior. We study the dynamics of subthreshold membrane potential and suprathreshold dendritic events throughout the dendritic arbor in vivo by combining voltage imaging with simultaneous local field potential recording, post hoc morphological reconstruction, and a spatial navigation task. We systematically quantify the modulation of local event rates by locomotion in distinct dendritic regions and report an advancing gradient of dendritic theta phase along the basal-tuft axis, then describe a predominant hyperpolarization of the dendritic arbor during sharp-wave ripples. Finally, we find spatial tuning of dendritic representations dynamically reorganizes following place field formation. Our data reveal how the organization of electrical signaling in dendrites maps onto the anatomy of the dendritic tree across behavior, oscillatory network, and functional cell states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Does being awake mean being conscious? This study investigates Mind Blanking (MB), characterized by an &#34;emptiness of mind&#34;, comparing it with Mind Wandering (MW) and On-task (ON) states. Using a sustained attention task and electroencephalogram monitoring on 26 participants, behavioral and neurophysiological signatures of MB were examined. MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses also revealed decreased frontal-posterior connectivity during MB and event-related potentials indicated a disruption in late-stage visual processing, suggesting a lack of conscious access to sensory information during MB. EEG-based neural features enabled trial-level prediction of mental states, furnishing estimates of the fine-grained dynamics of consciousness beyond subjective reports. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of continuous wake consciousness, suggesting that MB represents genuine gaps in our stream of thoughts.</p>
