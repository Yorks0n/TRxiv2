B.\nScore: 50.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561214\nAnimals learn the value of foods based on their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1-6 and preferences to those that are nutritious7-14. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavors experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for postingestive reactivation of neural flavor representations in this temporal credit assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel15-18, but not familiar, flavors with delayed gastric malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavors that support aversive postingestive learning. Surveying cellular resolution brainwide activation patterns reveals that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavors across every stage of the learning process: the initial meal, delayed malaise, and memory retrieval. By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of genetically defined hindbrain malaise cells, we find that postingestive malaise signals potently and specifically reactivate amygdalar novel flavor representations from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts strengthening of flavor responses upon memory retrieval, leading to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavor. In contrast, meals without postingestive consequences degrade neural flavor representations as flavors become familiar and safe. Thus, our findings demonstrate that interoceptive reactivation of amygdalar flavor representations provides a neural mechanism to resolve the temporal credit assignment problem inherent to postingestive learning.\nRepresentations of information value in mouse orbitofrontal cortex during information seeking\nAuthors: Bussell, J. J.; Badman, R. P.; Marton, C. D.; Bromberg-Martin, E. S.; Abbott, L.; Rajan, K.; Axel, R.\nScore: 48.4, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562291\nAnimals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.\nA suite of engineered mice for interrogating psychedelic drug actions\nAuthors: Chiu, Y.-t.; Deutch, A.; Wang, W.; Schmitz, G.

C.; Roth, B. L.\nScore: 101.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559347\nPsychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.\nCell type-focused compound screen in human organoids reveals molecules and pathways controlling cone photoreceptor death\nAuthors: Spirig, S.

However, such screens have not yet been performed. Here, we generated 20,000 human retinal organoids with GFP-labeled cone photoreceptors. Since degeneration of cones is a leading cause of blindness, we induced cone death and screened 2,707 compounds with known targets, for those that saved cones or those that further damaged cones. We identified kinase inhibitors that protected cones in both the short and longer term, HSP90 inhibitors that saved cones in the short term but damaged them in the longer term, and broad HDAC inhibition by many compounds that significantly damaged cones. This resource provides a database for cone-damaging compounds, and it describes compounds that can be starting points to develop neuroprotection for cones in diseases such as macular degeneration.\nTracking neurons across days with high-density probes\nAuthors: van Beest, E. H.; Bimbard, C.; Fabre, J. M. J.; Takacs, F.; Coen, P. H.; Lebedeva, A.; Harris, K. D.; Carandini, M.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562040\nNeural activity spans multiple scales from milliseconds to months. Its evolution can be recorded with chronic electrodes, and especially with high-density arrays such as Neuropixels probes, which measure each spike at tens of sites and record hundreds of neurons. These arrays often record units with consistent spike waveforms over time, but produce vast amounts of data that require new approaches for tracking neurons across recordings. To meet this need, we developed UnitMatch, an open-access pipeline that operates after spike sorting, based only on each unit's average spike waveform. We tested UnitMatch in Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain, where it tracked neurons across weeks. In visual cortex, a neuron's selectivity for visual stimuli and correlation with other neurons remained stable over days. In striatum, neuronal responses changed across days during learning of a task. UnitMatch is thus a promising tool to reveal invariance or plasticity in neural activity across days.\nAminergic and peptidergic modulation of Insulin-Producing Cells in Drosophila\nAuthors: Held, M.; Bisen, R. S.; Zandawala, M. M.; Chockley, A. S.; Balles, I. S.; Hilpert, S.; Liessem, S.; Cascino-Milani, F.; Ache, J. M.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557555\nInsulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands change momentarily, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated via various pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory pathways. Here, we analyzed how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in Drosophila - a population of Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized the functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, and an optogenetics-based \"intrinsic pharmacology\" approach. Our results showed that the IPC population expressed a variety of receptors for neuro-modulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, individual IPCs exhibited heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that they could be modulated differentially. This was supported by electrophysiological recordings of IPCs that we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs had heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibited one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occurred simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted the IPCs towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level framework of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of Drosophila.\nWidespread drastic reduction of brain myelin content upon prolonged endurance exercise\nAuthors: Ramos-Cabrer, P.; Cabrera, A.; Padro, D.; Matute-Gonzalez, M.; Rodriguez-Antiguedad, A.; Matute, C.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561303\nRecent evidence suggests that myelin lipids may act as glial energy reserves when glucose is lacking, a hypothesis yet to be solidly proven. Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.

S.; Duan, X.; Sanes, J.; Josselyn, S.; Frankland, P.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561722\nPost-training increases in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories in adult mice. This form of forgetting might be due to increased numbers of new neurons, remodeling of hippocampal circuitry or some combination of both. Here we tested the hypothesis that neurogenesis-mediated forgetting is caused by remodeling of hippocampal circuits by engineering mice in which adult-generated granule cells hypo- or hyper-integrate into hippocampal circuits. Using gene deletion, opto- and chemogenetic strategies, we find that hypo-integration of newborn neurons prevents post- training exercise-induced forgetting of contextual fear memories. Conversely, inducing hyper- integration of newborn neurons following contextual fear conditioning is sufficient to produce forgetting. Because these interventions did not affect survival of newborn neurons, these findings suggest that neurogenesis-mediated remodeling of hippocampal circuits represents a continuous and active form of interference that alters accessibility of engrams underlying hippocampal memories. Consistent with this, using engram-labeling approaches, we found that exercise-induced forgetting was associated with reduced engram reactivation.\nThe human microglia responsome: a resource to better understand microglia states in health and disease\nAuthors: Snijders, G.; de Paiva Lopes, K.; Sneeboer, M.; Muller, B.; Gigase, F.; Vialle, R.; Missall, R.; Kubler, R.; Raj, T.; Humphrey, J.; de Witte, L.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562067\nMicroglia, the immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders through genetic studies. However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis-expression QTLs (eQTLs). Together, we provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic database of the human microglia responsome.\nNeural bases of reading fluency: A systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Lee, M. M.; Stoodley, C.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559403\nReading fluency, the ability to read quickly and accurately, is a critical marker of successful reading and is notoriously difficult to improve in reading disabled populations. Despite its importance to functional literacy, fluency is a relatively under-studied aspect of reading, and the neural correlates of reading fluency are not well understood. Here, we review the literature of the neural correlates of reading fluency and rapid automatized naming (RAN), a task that is robustly related to reading speed. In a qualitative review of the neuroimaging literature, we evaluated structural and functional MRI studies of reading fluency in readers ranging in skill levels. This was followed by a quantitative activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI studies of reading fluency and RAN measures. We anticipated that reading speed, relative to untimed reading and reading-related tasks, would harness ventral reading pathways that are thought to enable the fast, visual recognition of words. The qualitative review showed that speeded reading taps the entire canonical reading network. The meta-analysis, which focused on in-scanner reading fluency measures, indicated a stronger role of the ventral reading pathway in fluent reading. Both reviews identified regions outside the canonical reading network that contribute to reading fluency, such as the bilateral insula and superior parietal lobule. We suggest that fluent reading engages both domain-specific reading pathways as well as domain-general regions that support overall task performance and discuss future avenues of research to expand our understanding of the neural bases of fluent reading.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Animals learn the value of foods based on their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1-6 and preferences to those that are nutritious7-14. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavors experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for postingestive reactivation of neural flavor representations in this temporal credit assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel15-18, but not familiar, flavors with delayed gastric malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavors that support aversive postingestive learning. Surveying cellular resolution brainwide activation patterns reveals that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavors across every stage of the learning process: the initial meal, delayed malaise, and memory retrieval. By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of genetically defined hindbrain malaise cells, we find that postingestive malaise signals potently and specifically reactivate amygdalar novel flavor representations from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts strengthening of flavor responses upon memory retrieval, leading to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavor. In contrast, meals without postingestive consequences degrade neural flavor representations as flavors become familiar and safe. Thus, our findings demonstrate that interoceptive reactivation of amygdalar flavor representations provides a neural mechanism to resolve the temporal credit assignment problem inherent to postingestive learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human organoids that mirror their corresponding organs in cell-type diversity present an opportunity to perform large-scale screens for compounds that protect disease-affected or damage healthy cell types. However, such screens have not yet been performed. Here, we generated 20,000 human retinal organoids with GFP-labeled cone photoreceptors. Since degeneration of cones is a leading cause of blindness, we induced cone death and screened 2,707 compounds with known targets, for those that saved cones or those that further damaged cones. We identified kinase inhibitors that protected cones in both the short and longer term, HSP90 inhibitors that saved cones in the short term but damaged them in the longer term, and broad HDAC inhibition by many compounds that significantly damaged cones. This resource provides a database for cone-damaging compounds, and it describes compounds that can be starting points to develop neuroprotection for cones in diseases such as macular degeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural activity spans multiple scales from milliseconds to months. Its evolution can be recorded with chronic electrodes, and especially with high-density arrays such as Neuropixels probes, which measure each spike at tens of sites and record hundreds of neurons. These arrays often record units with consistent spike waveforms over time, but produce vast amounts of data that require new approaches for tracking neurons across recordings. To meet this need, we developed UnitMatch, an open-access pipeline that operates after spike sorting, based only on each unit&#39;s average spike waveform. We tested UnitMatch in Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain, where it tracked neurons across weeks. In visual cortex, a neuron&#39;s selectivity for visual stimuli and correlation with other neurons remained stable over days. In striatum, neuronal responses changed across days during learning of a task. UnitMatch is thus a promising tool to reveal invariance or plasticity in neural activity across days.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands change momentarily, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated via various pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory pathways. Here, we analyzed how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in Drosophila - a population of Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized the functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, and an optogenetics-based &#34;intrinsic pharmacology&#34; approach. Our results showed that the IPC population expressed a variety of receptors for neuro-modulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, individual IPCs exhibited heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that they could be modulated differentially. This was supported by electrophysiological recordings of IPCs that we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs had heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibited one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occurred simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted the IPCs towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level framework of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent evidence suggests that myelin lipids may act as glial energy reserves when glucose is lacking, a hypothesis yet to be solidly proven. Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.

        <p class="abstract">Post-training increases in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories in adult mice. This form of forgetting might be due to increased numbers of new neurons, remodeling of hippocampal circuitry or some combination of both. Here we tested the hypothesis that neurogenesis-mediated forgetting is caused by remodeling of hippocampal circuits by engineering mice in which adult-generated granule cells hypo- or hyper-integrate into hippocampal circuits. Using gene deletion, opto- and chemogenetic strategies, we find that hypo-integration of newborn neurons prevents post- training exercise-induced forgetting of contextual fear memories. Conversely, inducing hyper- integration of newborn neurons following contextual fear conditioning is sufficient to produce forgetting. Because these interventions did not affect survival of newborn neurons, these findings suggest that neurogenesis-mediated remodeling of hippocampal circuits represents a continuous and active form of interference that alters accessibility of engrams underlying hippocampal memories. Consistent with this, using engram-labeling approaches, we found that exercise-induced forgetting was associated with reduced engram reactivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders through genetic studies. However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis-expression QTLs (eQTLs). Together, we provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic database of the human microglia responsome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reading fluency, the ability to read quickly and accurately, is a critical marker of successful reading and is notoriously difficult to improve in reading disabled populations. Despite its importance to functional literacy, fluency is a relatively under-studied aspect of reading, and the neural correlates of reading fluency are not well understood. Here, we review the literature of the neural correlates of reading fluency and rapid automatized naming (RAN), a task that is robustly related to reading speed. In a qualitative review of the neuroimaging literature, we evaluated structural and functional MRI studies of reading fluency in readers ranging in skill levels. This was followed by a quantitative activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI studies of reading fluency and RAN measures. We anticipated that reading speed, relative to untimed reading and reading-related tasks, would harness ventral reading pathways that are thought to enable the fast, visual recognition of words. The qualitative review showed that speeded reading taps the entire canonical reading network. The meta-analysis, which focused on in-scanner reading fluency measures, indicated a stronger role of the ventral reading pathway in fluent reading. Both reviews identified regions outside the canonical reading network that contribute to reading fluency, such as the bilateral insula and superior parietal lobule. We suggest that fluent reading engages both domain-specific reading pathways as well as domain-general regions that support overall task performance and discuss future avenues of research to expand our understanding of the neural bases of fluent reading.</p>
