A.; Misic, B.; Breakspear, M.\nScore: 42.6, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579070\nThe brain expresses activity in complex spatiotemporal patterns, reflected in the influence of spatially distributed cytoarchitectural, biochemical, and genetic properties. The correspondence between these multimodal \"brain maps\" may reflect underlying causal pathways and is hence a topic of substantial interest. However, these maps possess intrinsic smoothness (spatial autocorrelation, SA) which can inflate spurious cross-correlations, leading to false positive associations. Identifying true associations requires knowledge about the distribution of correlations that arise by chance in the presence of SA. This null distribution can be generated from an ensemble of surrogate brain maps that preserve internal SA but break correlations between maps. The present work introduces \"eigenstrapping\", using a spectral decomposition of cortical and subcortical surfaces in terms of geometric eigenmodes, and then randomly rotating these modes to produce SA-preserving surrogate brain maps. It is shown that these surrogates appropriately represent the null distribution of chance pairwise correlations, with similar or superior false positive control to current state-of-the-art procedures. Eigenstrapping is fast, eschews the need for parametric assumptions about the nature of the SA, and works with maps defined on smooth surfaces with or without a boundary. It generalizes to broader classes of null models than existing techniques, offering a unified approach for inference on cortical and subcortical maps, spatiotemporal processes, and complex patterns possessing higher-order correlations.\nSARS-COV-2 induces blood-brain barrier and choroid plexus barrier impairments and vascular inflammation in mice\nAuthors: Qiao, H.; Deng, X.; Qiu, L.; Qu, Y.; Chiu, Y.; Chen, F.; Xia, S.; Muenzel, C.; Ge, T.; Song, P.; Bonnin, A.; Zhao, Z.; Yuan, W.\nScore: 42.1, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579589\nThe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and near 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains as an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system. By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment. In addition, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus was also impaired after infection. Therefore, cerebrovascular and choroid plexus dysfunctions are important aspects of COVID-19 and may contribute to the neurological complications both acutely and in long COVID.\nA next-generation, histological atlas of the human brain and its application to automated brain MRI segmentation\nAuthors: Casamitjana, A.; Mancini, M.; Robinson, E.; Peter, L.; Annunziata, R.; Althonayan, J.; Crampsie, S.; Blackburn, E.; Billot, B.; Atzeni, A.; Puonti, O.; Balbastre, Y.; Schmidt, P.; Hughes, J.; Augustinack, J.; Edlow, B.

E.\nScore: 34.4, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.579016\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard tool to image the human brain in vivo. In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [3], BigBrain [4], Julich [5]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain, a next-generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct [~]10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes, as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build an atlas with probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of brain ageing based on [~]4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool), probabilistic atlas, and segmentation tool. By enabling researchers worldwide to analyse brain MRI scans at a superior level of granularity without manual effort or highly specific neuroanatomical knowledge, NextBrain will accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.\nHippocampal sequences span experience relative to rewards\nAuthors: Sosa, M.; Plitt, M. H.; Giocomo, L. M.\nScore: 37.6, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573490\nHippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.\nPrimary auditory cortex is necessary for the acquisition and expression of categorical behavior\nAuthors: Krall, R. F.; Chambers, C. N.; Arnold, M. P.; Brougher, L. I.; Chen, J.; Deshmukh, R.; King, H. B.; Morford, H. J.; Wiemann, J. M.; Williamson, R. S.\nScore: 25.7, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578700\nThe primary auditory cortex (ACtx) is critically involved in the association of sensory information with specific behavioral outcomes. Such sensory-guided behaviors are necessarily brain-wide endeavors, requiring a plethora of distinct brain areas, including those that are involved in aspects of decision making, motor planning, motor initiation, and reward prediction. ACtx comprises a number of distinct excitatory cell-types that allow for the brain-wide propagation of behaviorally-relevant sensory information. Exactly how ACtx involvement changes as a function of learning, as well as the functional role of distinct excitatory cell-types is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by designing a two-choice auditory task in which water-restricted, head-fixed mice were trained to categorize the temporal rate of a sinusoidal amplitude modulated (sAM) noise burst and used transient cell-type specific optogenetics to probe ACtx necessity across the duration of learning. Our data demonstrate that ACtx is necessary for the ability to categorize the rate of sAM noise, and this necessity grows across learning. ACtx silencing substantially altered the behavioral strategies used to solve the task by introducing a fluctuating choice bias and increasing dependence on prior decisions. Furthermore, ACtx silencing did not impact the animals motor report, suggesting that ACtx is necessary for the conversion of sensation to action. Targeted inhibition of extratelencephalic projections on just 20% of trials had a minimal effect on task performance, but significantly degraded learning. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct cortical cell-types synergistically control auditory-guided behavior and that extratelencephalic neurons play a critical role in learning and plasticity.\nPia-FLOW: Deciphering hemodynamic maps of the pial vascular connectome and its response to arterial occlusion\nAuthors: Glueck, C.; Zhou, Q.; Droux, J.; Chen, Z.; Glandorf, L.; Wegener, S.; Razansky, D.; Weber, B.; EL AMKI, M.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.577749\nThe pial vasculature is the sole source of blood supply to the neocortex. The brain is contained within the skull, a vascularized bone marrow with a unique anatomical connection to the brain. Recent developments in tissue clearing have enabled unprecedented mapping of the entire pial and calvarial vasculature. However, what are the absolute flow rates values of those vascular networks? This information cannot accurately be retrieved with the commonly used bioimaging methods. Here, we introduce Pia-FLOW, a new approach based on large-scale fluo-rescence localization microscopy, to attain hemodynamic imaging of the whole murine pial and calvarial vasculature at frame rates up to 1000 Hz and spatial resolution reaching 5.4 {micro}m. Using Pia-FLOW, we provide detailed maps of flow velocity, direction and vascular diameters which can serve as ground-truth data for further studies, advancing our understanding of brain fluid dynamics. Furthermore, Pia-FLOW revealed that the pial vascular network functions as one unit for robust allocation of blood after stroke.\nPsilocybin-enhanced fear extinction linked to bidirectional modulation of cortical ensembles\nAuthors: Rogers, S. A.; Heller, E. A.; Corder, G.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578811\nThe serotonin 2 receptor (5HT2R) agonist psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive inflexibility. Psilocybin may accomplish this by inducing rapid and stable dendritic plasticity. However, the impact of psilocybin on patterns of neural activity underlying sustained changes in cognitive and behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test the hypothesis that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by rapidly and persistently altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex across a five-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. Leveraging tensor component analysis to identify neurons that modulate activity on multiple temporal scales, we found that a single-dose of psilocybin induced cortical ensemble turnover between fear learning and extinction days while oppositely modulating activity in fear- and extinction-active neurons. The extent of suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons were both predictive of psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. These results both align with hypotheses that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new populations of neurons and introduce a new mechanism involving the suppression of fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.\nDopamine and DBS accelerate the neural dynamics of volitional action in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Köhler, R. M.; Binns, T. S.; Merk, T.; Zhu, G.; Yin, Z.; Zhao, B.; Chikermane, M.; Vanhoecke, J.; Busch, J. L.; Habets, J. G. V.; Faust, K.; Schneider, G.-H.; Cavallo, A.; Haufe, S.; Zhang, J.; Kühn, A. A.; Haynes, J.-D.; Neumann, W.-J.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564700\nThe ability to initiate volitional action is fundamental to human behaviour. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease is associated with impaired action initiation, also termed akinesia. Both dopamine and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate akinesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. An important question is whether dopamine and DBS facilitate de novo build-up of neural dynamics for motor execution or accelerate existing cortical movement initiation signals through shared modulatory circuit effects. Answering these questions can provide the foundation for new closed-loop neurotherapies with adaptive DBS, but the objectification of neural processing delays prior to performance of volitional action remains a significant challenge. To overcome this challenge, we studied readiness potentials and trained brain signal decoders on invasive neurophysiology signals in 25 DBS patients (12 female) with Parkinsons disease during performance of self-initiated movements. Combined sensorimotor cortex electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed OFF therapy (N=22), ON dopaminergic medication (N=18) and ON subthalamic deep brain stimulation (N=8). This allowed us to compare their therapeutic effects on neural latencies between the earliest cortical representation of movement intention as decoded by linear discriminant analysis classifiers and onset of muscle activation recorded with electromyography (EMG). In the hypodopaminergic OFF state, we observed long latencies between motor intention and motor execution for readiness potentials and machine learning classifications. Both, dopamine and DBS significantly shortened these latencies, hinting towards a shared therapeutic mechanism for alleviation of akinesia. To investigate this further, we analysed directional cortico-subthalamic oscillatory communication with multivariate granger causality. Strikingly, we found that both therapies independently shifted cortico-subthalamic oscillatory information flow from antikinetic beta (13-35 Hz) to prokinetic theta (4-10 Hz) rhythms, which was correlated with latencies in motor execution. Our study reveals a shared brain network modulation pattern of dopamine and DBS that may underlie the acceleration of neural dynamics for augmentation of movement initiation in Parkinsons disease. Instead of producing or increasing preparatory brain signals, both therapies modulate oscillatory communication. These insights provide a link between the pathophysiology of akinesia and its therapeutic alleviation with oscillatory network changes in other non-motor and motor domains, e.g. related to hyperkinesia or effort and reward perception. In the future, our study may inspire the development of clinical brain computer interfaces based on brain signal decoders to provide temporally precise support for action initiation in patients with brain disorders.\nIdentifying Interpretable Latent Factors with Sparse Component Analysis\nAuthors: Zimnik, A. J.; Ames, K. C.; An, X.; Driscoll, L.; Lara, A. H.; Russo, A. A.; Susoy, V.; Cunningham, J. P.; Paninski, L.; Churchland, M. M.; Glaser, J. I.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578988\nIn many neural populations, the computationally relevant signals are posited to be a set of latent factors - signals shared across many individual neurons. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and behavior requires the identification of factors that reflect distinct computational roles. Methods for identifying such factors typically require supervision, which can be suboptimal if one is unsure how (or whether) factors can be grouped into distinct, meaningful sets. Here, we introduce Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), an unsupervised method that identifies interpretable latent factors. SCA seeks factors that are sparse in time and occupy orthogonal dimensions. With these simple constraints, SCA facilitates surprisingly clear parcellations of neural activity across a range of behaviors. We applied SCA to motor cortex activity from reaching and cycling monkeys, single-trial imaging data from C. elegans, and activity from a multitask artificial network. SCA consistently identified sets of factors that were useful in describing network computations.\nRecent statistics shift object representations in parahippocampal cortex\nAuthors: Solomon, S. H.; Kay, K.; Schapiro, A. C.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579310\nOur representations of the world need to be stable enough to support general knowledge but flexible enough to incorporate new information as our environment changes. How does the human brain manage this stability-plasticity trade-off? We analyzed a large dataset in which participants viewed objects embedded in thousands of natural scenes across many fMRI sessions. Semantic item representations were located by jointly leveraging a voxelwise encoding model to find reliable item representations and a word-embedding model to evaluate semantic content. Within the medial temporal lobe, semantic item representations in hippocampal subfield CA1, parahippocampal cortex, and perirhinal cortex gradually drifted across a period of multiple months. However, rapid plasticity was observed only in parahippocampal cortex, such that item co-occurrence statistics warped item representations within a single session. In conjunction with whole-brain analyses, these results suggest that the brain solves the stability-plasticity trade-off by promoting plasticity in only a subset of semantic regions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The brain expresses activity in complex spatiotemporal patterns, reflected in the influence of spatially distributed cytoarchitectural, biochemical, and genetic properties. The correspondence between these multimodal &#34;brain maps&#34; may reflect underlying causal pathways and is hence a topic of substantial interest. However, these maps possess intrinsic smoothness (spatial autocorrelation, SA) which can inflate spurious cross-correlations, leading to false positive associations. Identifying true associations requires knowledge about the distribution of correlations that arise by chance in the presence of SA. This null distribution can be generated from an ensemble of surrogate brain maps that preserve internal SA but break correlations between maps. The present work introduces &#34;eigenstrapping&#34;, using a spectral decomposition of cortical and subcortical surfaces in terms of geometric eigenmodes, and then randomly rotating these modes to produce SA-preserving surrogate brain maps. It is shown that these surrogates appropriately represent the null distribution of chance pairwise correlations, with similar or superior false positive control to current state-of-the-art procedures. Eigenstrapping is fast, eschews the need for parametric assumptions about the nature of the SA, and works with maps defined on smooth surfaces with or without a boundary. It generalizes to broader classes of null models than existing techniques, offering a unified approach for inference on cortical and subcortical maps, spatiotemporal processes, and complex patterns possessing higher-order correlations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and near 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains as an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system. By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment. In addition, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus was also impaired after infection. Therefore, cerebrovascular and choroid plexus dysfunctions are important aspects of COVID-19 and may contribute to the neurological complications both acutely and in long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard tool to image the human brain in vivo. In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [3], BigBrain [4], Julich [5]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain, a next-generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct [~]10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes, as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build an atlas with probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of brain ageing based on [~]4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool), probabilistic atlas, and segmentation tool. By enabling researchers worldwide to analyse brain MRI scans at a superior level of granularity without manual effort or highly specific neuroanatomical knowledge, NextBrain will accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The primary auditory cortex (ACtx) is critically involved in the association of sensory information with specific behavioral outcomes. Such sensory-guided behaviors are necessarily brain-wide endeavors, requiring a plethora of distinct brain areas, including those that are involved in aspects of decision making, motor planning, motor initiation, and reward prediction. ACtx comprises a number of distinct excitatory cell-types that allow for the brain-wide propagation of behaviorally-relevant sensory information. Exactly how ACtx involvement changes as a function of learning, as well as the functional role of distinct excitatory cell-types is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by designing a two-choice auditory task in which water-restricted, head-fixed mice were trained to categorize the temporal rate of a sinusoidal amplitude modulated (sAM) noise burst and used transient cell-type specific optogenetics to probe ACtx necessity across the duration of learning. Our data demonstrate that ACtx is necessary for the ability to categorize the rate of sAM noise, and this necessity grows across learning. ACtx silencing substantially altered the behavioral strategies used to solve the task by introducing a fluctuating choice bias and increasing dependence on prior decisions. Furthermore, ACtx silencing did not impact the animals motor report, suggesting that ACtx is necessary for the conversion of sensation to action. Targeted inhibition of extratelencephalic projections on just 20% of trials had a minimal effect on task performance, but significantly degraded learning. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct cortical cell-types synergistically control auditory-guided behavior and that extratelencephalic neurons play a critical role in learning and plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pial vasculature is the sole source of blood supply to the neocortex. The brain is contained within the skull, a vascularized bone marrow with a unique anatomical connection to the brain. Recent developments in tissue clearing have enabled unprecedented mapping of the entire pial and calvarial vasculature. However, what are the absolute flow rates values of those vascular networks? This information cannot accurately be retrieved with the commonly used bioimaging methods. Here, we introduce Pia-FLOW, a new approach based on large-scale fluo-rescence localization microscopy, to attain hemodynamic imaging of the whole murine pial and calvarial vasculature at frame rates up to 1000 Hz and spatial resolution reaching 5.4 {micro}m. Using Pia-FLOW, we provide detailed maps of flow velocity, direction and vascular diameters which can serve as ground-truth data for further studies, advancing our understanding of brain fluid dynamics. Furthermore, Pia-FLOW revealed that the pial vascular network functions as one unit for robust allocation of blood after stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The serotonin 2 receptor (5HT2R) agonist psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive inflexibility. Psilocybin may accomplish this by inducing rapid and stable dendritic plasticity. However, the impact of psilocybin on patterns of neural activity underlying sustained changes in cognitive and behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test the hypothesis that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by rapidly and persistently altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex across a five-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. Leveraging tensor component analysis to identify neurons that modulate activity on multiple temporal scales, we found that a single-dose of psilocybin induced cortical ensemble turnover between fear learning and extinction days while oppositely modulating activity in fear- and extinction-active neurons. The extent of suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons were both predictive of psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. These results both align with hypotheses that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new populations of neurons and introduce a new mechanism involving the suppression of fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to initiate volitional action is fundamental to human behaviour. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease is associated with impaired action initiation, also termed akinesia. Both dopamine and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate akinesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. An important question is whether dopamine and DBS facilitate de novo build-up of neural dynamics for motor execution or accelerate existing cortical movement initiation signals through shared modulatory circuit effects. Answering these questions can provide the foundation for new closed-loop neurotherapies with adaptive DBS, but the objectification of neural processing delays prior to performance of volitional action remains a significant challenge.

To overcome this challenge, we studied readiness potentials and trained brain signal decoders on invasive neurophysiology signals in 25 DBS patients (12 female) with Parkinsons disease during performance of self-initiated movements. Combined sensorimotor cortex electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed OFF therapy (N=22), ON dopaminergic medication (N=18) and ON subthalamic deep brain stimulation (N=8). This allowed us to compare their therapeutic effects on neural latencies between the earliest cortical representation of movement intention as decoded by linear discriminant analysis classifiers and onset of muscle activation recorded with electromyography (EMG).

In the hypodopaminergic OFF state, we observed long latencies between motor intention and motor execution for readiness potentials and machine learning classifications. Both, dopamine and DBS significantly shortened these latencies, hinting towards a shared therapeutic mechanism for alleviation of akinesia. To investigate this further, we analysed directional cortico-subthalamic oscillatory communication with multivariate granger causality. Strikingly, we found that both therapies independently shifted cortico-subthalamic oscillatory information flow from antikinetic beta (13-35 Hz) to prokinetic theta (4-10 Hz) rhythms, which was correlated with latencies in motor execution.

Our study reveals a shared brain network modulation pattern of dopamine and DBS that may underlie the acceleration of neural dynamics for augmentation of movement initiation in Parkinsons disease. Instead of producing or increasing preparatory brain signals, both therapies modulate oscillatory communication. These insights provide a link between the pathophysiology of akinesia and its therapeutic alleviation with oscillatory network changes in other non-motor and motor domains, e.g. related to hyperkinesia or effort and reward perception. In the future, our study may inspire the development of clinical brain computer interfaces based on brain signal decoders to provide temporally precise support for action initiation in patients with brain disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In many neural populations, the computationally relevant signals are posited to be a set of  latent factors - signals shared across many individual neurons. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and behavior requires the identification of factors that reflect distinct computational roles. Methods for identifying such factors typically require supervision, which can be suboptimal if one is unsure how (or whether) factors can be grouped into distinct, meaningful sets. Here, we introduce Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), an unsupervised method that identifies interpretable latent factors. SCA seeks factors that are sparse in time and occupy orthogonal dimensions. With these simple constraints, SCA facilitates surprisingly clear parcellations of neural activity across a range of behaviors. We applied SCA to motor cortex activity from reaching and cycling monkeys, single-trial imaging data from C. elegans, and activity from a multitask artificial network. SCA consistently identified sets of factors that were useful in describing network computations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our representations of the world need to be stable enough to support general knowledge but flexible enough to incorporate new information as our environment changes. How does the human brain manage this stability-plasticity trade-off? We analyzed a large dataset in which participants viewed objects embedded in thousands of natural scenes across many fMRI sessions. Semantic item representations were located by jointly leveraging a voxelwise encoding model to find reliable item representations and a word-embedding model to evaluate semantic content. Within the medial temporal lobe, semantic item representations in hippocampal subfield CA1, parahippocampal cortex, and perirhinal cortex gradually drifted across a period of multiple months. However, rapid plasticity was observed only in parahippocampal cortex, such that item co-occurrence statistics warped item representations within a single session. In conjunction with whole-brain analyses, these results suggest that the brain solves the stability-plasticity trade-off by promoting plasticity in only a subset of semantic regions.</p>
