L.\nScore: 522.9, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563117\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.\nMenstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and grey matter architecture changes across the whole brain\nAuthors: Rizor, E. J.; Babenko, V.; Dundon, N. M.; Beverly-Aylwin, R.; Stump, A.; Hayes, M.; Herschenfeld-Catalan, L.; Jacobs, E. G.; Grafton, S. T.\nScore: 159.9, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561616\nCyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.\nCaveolin-1 mediates neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Trevino, T. N.; Fogel, A. B.; Minshall, R.; Richner, J. M.; Lutz, S. E.\nScore: 51.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.563024\nLeukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3+ T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.\nBinge Feeding Promotes Appetite via Modulating Olfactory Flavor Representation\nAuthors: Lo, H.; Tantirigama, M. L. S.; Schoenherr, A.; Moreno-Velasquez, L.; Faiss, L.; Rost, B. R.; Larkum, M. E.; Judkewitz, B.; Stumpenhorst, K.; Rivalan, M.; Winter, Y.; Schmitz, D.; Johenning, F. W.\nScore: 43.3, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562714\nBinge eating commonly leads to overeating (1; 2; 3; 4), but the exact mechanism is unclear. While it is known that experiencing flavor contributes to satiety, the interactions between flavor, feeding rate, and food intake remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel feeding rate-dependent feedback loop between olfactory flavor representation in the anterior olfactory (piriform) cortex (aPC) and food intake. We developed a liquid food delivery system that allows food consumption at different feeding rates. Using miniscopes for in vivo calcium imaging in freely foraging mice, we identified specific excitatory neuronal responses to food and water during slow feeding. Switching to binge feeding transformed these specific responses into unspecific global suppression of neuronal activity. In the gustatory cortex and the olfactory bulb, we observed similarities in flavor representation during binge and slow feeding. Food consumption was predicted by the degree of suppression of neuronal activity in the aPC during binge feeding. Also, food deprivation enhanced neuronal activity suppression. We confirmed the hypothesis that aPC suppression promotes food intake with closed-loop optogenetics experiments. Together, our results show that olfactory sensory representation in the aPC reciprocally interacts with consummatory behavior to enhance food intake.\nSmartEM: machine-learning guided electron microscopy\nAuthors: Meirovitch, Y.; Park, C. F.; Mi, L.; Potocek, P.; Sawmya, S.; Li, Y.; Wu, Y.; Schalek, R.; Pfister, H.; Schoenmakers, R.; Peemen, M.; Lichtman, J. W.; Samuel, A.; Shavit, N.\nScore: 43.2, Published: 2023-10-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561103\nConnectomics provides essential nanometer-resolution, synapse-level maps of neural circuits to understand brain activity and behavior. However, few researchers have access to the high-throughput electron microscopes to rapidly generate the very large datasets needed for reconstructing whole circuits or brains. To date, machine-learning methods have been used after the collection of images by electron microscopy (EM) to accelerate and improve neuronal segmentation, synapse reconstruction and other data analysis. With the computational improvements in processing EM images, acquiring EM images has now become the rate-limiting step. Here, in order to speed up EM imaging, we integrate machine-learning into real-time image acquisition in a single-beam scanning electron microscope. This SmartEM approach allows an electron microscope to perform intelligent, data-aware imaging of specimens. SmartEM allocates the proper imaging time for each region of interest - scanning all pixels as rapidly, but then re-scanning small subareas more slowly where a higher quality signal is required in order to guarantee uniform segmentability of the entire field of view but with a significant time savings. We demonstrate that this pipeline achieves a 7-fold acceleration of image acquisition time for connectomics using a commercial single-beam SEM. We apply SmartEM to reconstruct a portion of mouse cortex with the same accuracy as traditional microscopy but in less time.\nRepresentations of information value in mouse orbitofrontal cortex during information seeking\nAuthors: Bussell, J. J.; Badman, R. P.; Marton, C. D.; Bromberg-Martin, E. S.; Abbott, L.; Rajan, K.; Axel, R.\nScore: 48.7, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562291\nAnimals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.\nTracking neurons across days with high-density probes\nAuthors: van Beest, E. H.; Bimbard, C.; Fabre, J. M. J.; Takacs, F.; Coen, P. H.; Lebedeva, A.; Harris, K. D.; Carandini, M.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562040\nNeural activity spans multiple scales from milliseconds to months. Its evolution can be recorded with chronic electrodes, and especially with high-density arrays such as Neuropixels probes, which measure each spike at tens of sites and record hundreds of neurons. These arrays often record units with consistent spike waveforms over time, but produce vast amounts of data that require new approaches for tracking neurons across recordings. To meet this need, we developed UnitMatch, an open-access pipeline that operates after spike sorting, based only on each units average spike waveform. We tested UnitMatch in Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain, where it tracked neurons across weeks. In visual cortex, a neurons selectivity for visual stimuli and correlation with other neurons remained stable over days. In striatum, neuronal responses changed across days during learning of a task. UnitMatch is thus a promising tool to reveal invariance or plasticity in neural activity across days.\nGenetically- and spatially-defined basolateral amygdala neurons control food consumption and social interaction\nAuthors: lim, H.; Zhang, Y.; Peters, C.; Straub, T.; Mayer, J. L.; Klein, R.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562740\nThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) contains discrete neuronal circuits that integrate positive or negative emotional information and drive the appropriate innate and learned behaviors. Whether these circuits consist of genetically-identifiable and anatomically segregated neuron types, is poorly understood. Also, our understanding of the response patterns and behavioral spectra of genetically-identifiable BLA neurons is limited. Here, we classified 11 glutamatergic BLA cell clusters and found that several of them were anatomically segregated in lateral versus basal amygdala, and anterior versus posterior regions of the BLA. Two of these BLA subpopulations innately responded to valence-specific, whereas one responded to mixed - aversive and social - cues. Positive-valence BLA neurons promoted normal feeding, while mixed selectivity neurons promoted fear learning and social interactions. These findings enhance our understanding of cell type diversity and spatial organization of the BLA and the role of distinct BLA populations in representing valence-specific and mixed stimuli. HighlightsO_LIClassification of molecularly-defined glutamatergic neuron types in mouse BLA with distinct spatial expression patterns. C_LIO_LIBLALypd1 neurons are positive-valence neurons innately responding to food and promoting normal feeding. C_LIO_LIBLAEtv1 neurons innately represent aversive and social stimuli. C_LIO_LIBLAEtv1 neurons promote fear learning and social interactions. C_LI\nA blue-shifted genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator with enhanced two-photon absorption\nAuthors: Aggarwal, A.; Sunil, S.; Bendifallah, I.; Moon, M.; Drobizhev, M.; Zarowny, L.; Zheng, J.; Wu, S.-Y.; Lohman, A.; Tebo, A.; EMILIANI, V.; Podgorski, K.; Shen, Y.; Campbell, R.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562058\nSignificanceGenetically encoded calcium ion (Ca2+) indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for monitoring intracellular Ca2+ concentration changes in living cells and model organisms. In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring the transient increase of Ca2+ concentration that is associated with the neuronal action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular, blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy. AimWe describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 - a high-performance blue-shifted GECI based on the Clavularia sp.-derived mTFP1. ApproachWe used protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance in vitro using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in vivo using one-photon excitation fiber photometry in mice, and ex vivo using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal slices. ResultsThe Ca2+-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of 468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of 49,300 M-1cm-1, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately double that of EGFP. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold and the apparent Kd for Ca2+ is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at 850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled detection of action potentials with higher signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant. ConclusionT-GECO1 is a high performance blue-shifted GECI that, under two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation GCaMP variants.\nSibling chimerism among microglia in marmosets\nAuthors: del Rosario, R. C. H.; Krienen, F. M.; Zhang, Q.; Goldman, M.; Mello, C.; Lutservitz, A.; Ichihara, K.; Wysoker, A.; Nemesh, J.; Feng, G.; McCarroll, S. A.\nScore: 24.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562516\nChimerism happens rarely among most mammals but is common in marmosets and tamarins, a result of fraternal twin or triplet birth patterns in which in utero connected circulatory systems (through which stem cells transit) lead to persistent blood chimerism (12-80%) throughout life. The presence of Y-chromosome DNA sequences in other organs of female marmosets has long suggested that chimerism might also affect these organs. However, a longstanding question is whether this chimerism is driven by blood-derived cells or involves contributions from other cell types. To address this question, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from blood, liver, kidney and multiple brain regions across a number of marmosets, using transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify cells with the siblings genome in various cell types within these tissues. Sibling-derived chimerism in all tissues arose entirely from cells of hematopoietic origin (i.e., myeloid and lymphoid lineages). In brain tissue this was reflected as sibling-derived chimerism among microglia (20-52%) and macrophages (18-64%) but not among other resident cell types (i.e., neurons, glia or ependymal cells). The percentage of microglia that were sibling-derived showed significant variation across brain regions, even within individual animals, likely reflecting distinct responses by siblings microglia to local recruitment or proliferation cues or, potentially, distinct clonal expansion histories in different brain areas. In the animals and tissues we analyzed, microglial gene expression profiles bore a much stronger relationship to local/host context than to sibling genetic differences. Naturally occurring marmoset chimerism will provide new ways to understand the effects of genes, mutations and brain contexts on microglial biology and to distinguish between effects of microglia and other cell types on brain phenotypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3&#43; T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Binge eating commonly leads to overeating (1; 2; 3; 4), but the exact mechanism is unclear. While it is known that experiencing flavor contributes to satiety, the interactions between flavor, feeding rate, and food intake remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel feeding rate-dependent feedback loop between olfactory flavor representation in the anterior olfactory (piriform) cortex (aPC) and food intake. We developed a liquid food delivery system that allows food consumption at different feeding rates. Using miniscopes for in vivo calcium imaging in freely foraging mice, we identified specific excitatory neuronal responses to food and water during slow feeding. Switching to binge feeding transformed these specific responses into unspecific global suppression of neuronal activity. In the gustatory cortex and the olfactory bulb, we observed similarities in flavor representation during binge and slow feeding. Food consumption was predicted by the degree of suppression of neuronal activity in the aPC during binge feeding. Also, food deprivation enhanced neuronal activity suppression. We confirmed the hypothesis that aPC suppression promotes food intake with closed-loop optogenetics experiments. Together, our results show that olfactory sensory representation in the aPC reciprocally interacts with consummatory behavior to enhance food intake.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connectomics provides essential nanometer-resolution, synapse-level maps of neural circuits to understand brain activity and behavior. However, few researchers have access to the high-throughput electron microscopes to rapidly generate the very large datasets needed for reconstructing whole circuits or brains. To date, machine-learning methods have been used after the collection of images by electron microscopy (EM) to accelerate and improve neuronal segmentation, synapse reconstruction and other data analysis. With the computational improvements in processing EM images, acquiring EM images has now become the rate-limiting step. Here, in order to speed up EM imaging, we integrate machine-learning into real-time image acquisition in a single-beam scanning electron microscope. This SmartEM approach allows an electron microscope to perform intelligent, data-aware imaging of specimens. SmartEM allocates the proper imaging time for each region of interest - scanning all pixels as rapidly, but then re-scanning small subareas more slowly where a higher quality signal is required in order to guarantee uniform segmentability of the entire field of view but with a significant time savings. We demonstrate that this pipeline achieves a 7-fold acceleration of image acquisition time for connectomics using a commercial single-beam SEM. We apply SmartEM to reconstruct a portion of mouse cortex with the same accuracy as traditional microscopy but in less time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural activity spans multiple scales from milliseconds to months. Its evolution can be recorded with chronic electrodes, and especially with high-density arrays such as Neuropixels probes, which measure each spike at tens of sites and record hundreds of neurons. These arrays often record units with consistent spike waveforms over time, but produce vast amounts of data that require new approaches for tracking neurons across recordings. To meet this need, we developed UnitMatch, an open-access pipeline that operates after spike sorting, based only on each units average spike waveform. We tested UnitMatch in Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain, where it tracked neurons across weeks. In visual cortex, a neurons selectivity for visual stimuli and correlation with other neurons remained stable over days. In striatum, neuronal responses changed across days during learning of a task. UnitMatch is thus a promising tool to reveal invariance or plasticity in neural activity across days.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The basolateral amygdala (BLA) contains discrete neuronal circuits that integrate positive or negative emotional information and drive the appropriate innate and learned behaviors. Whether these circuits consist of genetically-identifiable and anatomically segregated neuron types, is poorly understood. Also, our understanding of the response patterns and behavioral spectra of genetically-identifiable BLA neurons is limited. Here, we classified 11 glutamatergic BLA cell clusters and found that several of them were anatomically segregated in lateral versus basal amygdala, and anterior versus posterior regions of the BLA. Two of these BLA subpopulations innately responded to valence-specific, whereas one responded to mixed - aversive and social - cues. Positive-valence BLA neurons promoted normal feeding, while mixed selectivity neurons promoted fear learning and social interactions. These findings enhance our understanding of cell type diversity and spatial organization of the BLA and the role of distinct BLA populations in representing valence-specific and mixed stimuli.

In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring the transient increase of Ca2&#43; concentration that is associated with the neuronal action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular, blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy.

AimWe describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 - a high-performance blue-shifted GECI based on the Clavularia sp.-derived mTFP1.

ApproachWe used protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance in vitro using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in vivo using one-photon excitation fiber photometry in mice, and ex vivo using two-photon Ca2&#43; imaging in hippocampal slices.

ResultsThe Ca2&#43;-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of 468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of 49,300 M-1cm-1, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately double that of EGFP. The Ca2&#43;-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold and the apparent Kd for Ca2&#43; is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at 850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled detection of action potentials with higher signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant.

ConclusionT-GECO1 is a high performance blue-shifted GECI that, under two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation GCaMP variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimerism happens rarely among most mammals but is common in marmosets and tamarins, a result of fraternal twin or triplet birth patterns in which in utero connected circulatory systems (through which stem cells transit) lead to persistent blood chimerism (12-80%) throughout life. The presence of Y-chromosome DNA sequences in other organs of female marmosets has long suggested that chimerism might also affect these organs. However, a longstanding question is whether this chimerism is driven by blood-derived cells or involves contributions from other cell types. To address this question, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from blood, liver, kidney and multiple brain regions across a number of marmosets, using transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify cells with the siblings genome in various cell types within these tissues. Sibling-derived chimerism in all tissues arose entirely from cells of hematopoietic origin (i.e., myeloid and lymphoid lineages). In brain tissue this was reflected as sibling-derived chimerism among microglia (20-52%) and macrophages (18-64%) but not among other resident cell types (i.e., neurons, glia or ependymal cells). The percentage of microglia that were sibling-derived showed significant variation across brain regions, even within individual animals, likely reflecting distinct responses by siblings microglia to local recruitment or proliferation cues or, potentially, distinct clonal expansion histories in different brain areas. In the animals and tissues we analyzed, microglial gene expression profiles bore a much stronger relationship to local/host context than to sibling genetic differences. Naturally occurring marmoset chimerism will provide new ways to understand the effects of genes, mutations and brain contexts on microglial biology and to distinguish between effects of microglia and other cell types on brain phenotypes.</p>
