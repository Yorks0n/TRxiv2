S.; Johnson, Z. V.\nScore: 41.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577753\nSexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish. Significance StatementThis study provides key insights into brain sex differences in sex-changing anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris), a species that changes sex in adulthood in response to the social environment. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, the study provides the first brain cellular atlas showing sex differences in two crucial reproductive areas: the preoptic area and telencephalon. The research identifies notable sex-differences in cell-type proportions and gene expression, particularly in radial glia and glutamatergic neurons that co-express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. It also highlights differences in preoptic area neurons likely involved in gonadal regulation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation of the brain in vertebrates, especially those capable of adult sex change, and illuminates key molecular and cellular beginning and endpoints of the process.\nPlanar, Spiral, and Concentric Traveling Waves Distinguish Cognitive States in Human Memory\nAuthors: Das, A.; Zabeh, E.; Ermentrout, B.; Jacobs, J.\nScore: 43.1, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577456\nA fundamental challenge in neuroscience is explaining how widespread brain regions flexibly interact to support behaviors. We hypothesize that a mechanism of neural coordination is brain oscillations that propagate as traveling waves across the cortex in distinctive patterns that control when and where different regions interact. To test this hypothesis, we used direct recordings from humans performing multiple memory experiments and a novel analytical framework that measures the directional propagation of oscillations. We found that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in not only plane waves as seen previously, but also in spirals, sources and sinks, and more complex patterns. These traveling wave patterns correlated with various aspects of behavior, with specific propagation patterns reflecting broad cognitive processes, and the identities of specific remembered items. Together, these findings show that complex spatiotemporal patterns of traveling waves underlie human cognition and are relevant practically for neural decoding and brain-computer interfacing.\nMitochondrial Ca2+ efflux controls neuronal metabolism and long-term memory across species\nAuthors: Vishwanath, A. A.; Comyn, T.; Chintaluri, C.; Ramon-Duaso, C.; Fan, R.; Sivakumar, R.; Lopez-Manzaneda, M.; Preat, T.; Vogels, T. P.; Rangaraju, V.; Busquets-Garcia, A.; Placais, P.-Y.; Pavlowsky, A.; de Juan-Sanz, J.\nScore: 33.4, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578153\nWhile impairing neuronal metabolism limits brain performance, it remains poorly understood whether enhancing metabolism in neurons, in contrast, could boost brain function. We find that reducing the expression of the mitochondrial H+/Ca2+ exchanger Letm1 results in increased Ca2+ retention in the mitochondrial matrix of firing neurons, which overactivates neuronal metabolism in flies and rodents. We find that upscaled metabolic states in active neurons of central memory circuits of flies and mice enable storing long-term memories in training paradigms in which wild-type counterparts of both species fail to remember. Our findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that controls mitochondrial metabolism in active neurons and prove its crucial role in governing higher brain functions, such as long-term memory formation. Highlights- Letm1 controls activity-driven mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux in neurons - Increased mitochondrial Ca2+ retention during activity overactivates neuronal metabolism - Activity-driven upscaling of neuronal metabolism facilitates long-term olfactory memory in flies and mice\nArc mediates intercellular synaptic plasticity via IRSp53-dependent extracellular vesicle biogenesis.\nAuthors: Ravens, A.; Sullivan, K.; Einstein, J.; Keceli, S. K.; Kicmal, T.; Tyagi, M.; Hantak, M. P.; Shepherd, T.; Stewart, A.; Lyon, K.; Dharan, A.; Gallagher, T.; Campbell, E. M.; Shepherd, J. D.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578027\nCurrent models of learning and memory have focused on cell-autonomous regulation of synaptic strength; however, intercellular signaling between cells in the brain is critical for normal cognition. The immediate early gene Arc is a repurposed retrotransposon critical for long-term forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Arc protein forms virus-like capsids released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that signal cell-to-cell. Here, we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) stimuli induce the biogenesis of Arc EVs by recruiting the I-BAR protein IRSp53 to dendrites, which facilitates Arc capsid assembly and release. Arc EVs transfer Arc protein and mRNA to neighboring neurons, where translation of transferred Arc mRNA induces a loss of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These results show that Arc EVs mediate non-cell autonomous long-term depression (LTD), revealing an intercellular form of synaptic plasticity that may be critical for memory consolidation.\nPrimary auditory cortex is necessary for the acquisition and expression of categorical behavior\nAuthors: Krall, R. F.; Chambers, C. N.; Arnold, M. P.; Brougher, L. I.; Chen, J.; Deshmukh, R.; King, H. B.; Morford, H. J.; Wiemann, J. M.; Williamson, R. S.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578700\nThe primary auditory cortex (ACtx) is critically involved in the association of sensory information with specific behavioral outcomes. Such sensory-guided behaviors are necessarily brain-wide endeavors, requiring a plethora of distinct brain areas, including those that are involved in aspects of decision making, motor planning, motor initiation, and reward prediction. ACtx comprises a number of distinct excitatory cell-types that allow for the brain-wide propagation of behaviorally-relevant sensory information. Exactly how ACtx involvement changes as a function of learning, as well as the functional role of distinct excitatory cell-types is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by designing a two-choice auditory task in which water-restricted, head-fixed mice were trained to categorize the temporal rate of a sinusoidal amplitude modulated (sAM) noise burst and used transient cell-type specific optogenetics to probe ACtx necessity across the duration of learning. Our data demonstrate that ACtx is necessary for the ability to categorize the rate of sAM noise, and this necessity grows across learning. ACtx silencing substantially altered the behavioral strategies used to solve the task by introducing a fluctuating choice bias and increasing dependence on prior decisions. Furthermore, ACtx silencing did not impact the animal's motor report, suggesting that ACtx is necessary for the conversion of sensation to action. Targeted inhibition of extratelencephalic projections on just 20% of trials had a minimal effect on task performance, but significantly degraded learning. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct cortical cell-types synergistically control auditory-guided behavior and that extratelencephalic neurons play a critical role in learning and plasticity.\nPia-FLOW: Deciphering hemodynamic maps of the pial vascular connectome and its response to arterial occlusion\nAuthors: Glueck, C.; Zhou, Q.; Droux, J.; Chen, Z.; Glandorf, L.; Wegener, S.; Razansky, D.; Weber, B.; EL AMKI, M.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.577749\nThe pial vasculature is the sole source of blood supply to the neocortex. Above the pia is the skull, a vascularized bone marrow with a unique anatomical connection to the brain. Recent developments in tissue clearing have enabled unprecedented mapping of the entire pial and calvarial vasculature. However, what are the absolute flow rates values of those vascular networks? This information cannot accurately be retrieved with the commonly used bioimaging methods. Here, we introduce Pia-FLOW, a new approach based on large-scale fluorescence localization microscopy, to attain hemodynamic imaging of the whole murine pial and calvarial vasculature at frame rates up to 1000 Hz and spatial resolution reaching 5.4 um. Using Pia-FLOW, we provide detailed maps of flow velocity, direction and vascular diameters which can serve as ground-truth data for further studies, advancing our understanding of brain fluid dynamics. Furthermore, Pia-FLOW revealed that the pial vascular network functions as one unit for the robust allocation of blood after stroke.\nPsilocybin-enhanced fear extinction linked to bidirectional modulation of cortical ensembles\nAuthors: Rogers, S. A.; Heller, E. A.; Corder, G.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578811\nThe serotonin 2 receptor (5HT2R) agonist psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive inflexibility. Psilocybin may accomplish this by inducing rapid and stable dendritic plasticity. However, the impact of psilocybin on patterns of neural activity underlying sustained changes in cognitive and behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test the hypothesis that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by rapidly and persistently altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex across a five-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. Leveraging tensor component analysis to identify neurons that modulate activity on multiple temporal scales, we found that a single-dose of psilocybin induced cortical ensemble turnover between fear learning and extinction days while oppositely modulating activity in fear- and extinction- active neurons. The extent of suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons were both predictive of psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. These results both align with hypotheses that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new populations of neurons and introduce a new mechanism involving the suppression of fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.\nHippocampal sequences span experience relative to rewards\nAuthors: Sosa, M.; Plitt, M. H.; Giocomo, L. M.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573490\nHippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.\nA Multimodal Characterization of Low-Dimensional Thalamocortical Structural Connectivity Patterns\nAuthors: John, A.; Hettwer, M. D.; Schaare, H. L.; Saberi, A.; Bayrak, S.; Wan, B.; Royer, J.; Bernhardt, B. C.; Valk, S. L.\nScore: 17.7, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578366\nThe human thalamus is a bilateral and heterogeneous grey matter structure that plays a crucial role in coordinating whole-brain activity. Investigations of its complex structural and functional internal organization revealed to a certain degree overlapping parcellations, however, a consensus on thalamic subnuclei boundaries remains absent. Recent work suggests that thalamic organization might additionally reflect continuous axes transcending nuclear boundaries. In this study, we used a multimodal approach to uncover how low-dimensional axes that describe thalamic connectivity patterns to the cortex are related to internal thalamic microstructural features, functional connectivity, and structural covariance. We computed a thalamocortical structural connectome via probabilistic tractography on diffusion MRI and derived two main axes of thalamic organization. The principal thalamic gradient, extending from medial to lateral and differentiating between transmodal and unimodal nuclei, was related to intrathalamic myelin profiles, and patterns of functional connectivity, while the secondary axis showed correspondence to core-matrix cell type distributions. Lastly, exploring multimodal thalamocortical associations on a global scale, we observed that the medial-to- lateral gradient consistently differentiated limbic, frontoparietal, and default mode network nodes from dorsal and ventral attention networks across modalities. However, the link with sensory modalities varied. In sum, we show the coherence between lower dimensional patterns of thalamocortical structural connectivity and various modalities, shedding light on multiscale thalamic organization.\nBuilding compositional tasks with shared neural subspaces\nAuthors: Tafazoli, S.; Bouchacourt, F.; Ardalan, A.; Markov, N. T.; Uchimura, M.; Gomes Mattar, M. G.; Daw, N. D.; Buschman, T. J.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578263\nCognition is remarkably flexible; we are able to rapidly learn and perform many different tasks1. Theoretical modeling has shown artificial neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks will re-use representations2 and computational components3 across tasks. By composing tasks from these sub-components, an agent can flexibly switch between tasks and rapidly learn new tasks4. Yet, whether such compositionality is found in the brain is unknown. Here, we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task compositionally combining these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. Neural recordings found task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Subspaces were flexibly engaged as monkeys discovered the task in effect; their internal belief about the current task predicted the strength of representations in task-relevant subspaces. In sum, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations across tasks.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Sexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish.

Significance StatementThis study provides key insights into brain sex differences in sex-changing anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris), a species that changes sex in adulthood in response to the social environment. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, the study provides the first brain cellular atlas showing sex differences in two crucial reproductive areas: the preoptic area and telencephalon. The research identifies notable sex-differences in cell-type proportions and gene expression, particularly in radial glia and glutamatergic neurons that co-express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. It also highlights differences in preoptic area neurons likely involved in gonadal regulation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation of the brain in vertebrates, especially those capable of adult sex change, and illuminates key molecular and cellular beginning and endpoints of the process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is explaining how widespread brain regions flexibly interact to support behaviors. We hypothesize that a mechanism of neural coordination is brain oscillations that propagate as traveling waves across the cortex in distinctive patterns that control when and where different regions interact. To test this hypothesis, we used direct recordings from humans performing multiple memory experiments and a novel analytical framework that measures the directional propagation of oscillations. We found that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in not only plane waves as seen previously, but also in spirals, sources and sinks, and more complex patterns. These traveling wave patterns correlated with various aspects of behavior, with specific propagation patterns reflecting broad cognitive processes, and the identities of specific remembered items. Together, these findings show that complex spatiotemporal patterns of traveling waves underlie human cognition and are relevant practically for neural decoding and brain-computer interfacing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While impairing neuronal metabolism limits brain performance, it remains poorly understood whether enhancing metabolism in neurons, in contrast, could boost brain function. We find that reducing the expression of the mitochondrial H&#43;/Ca2&#43; exchanger Letm1 results in increased Ca2&#43; retention in the mitochondrial matrix of firing neurons, which overactivates neuronal metabolism in flies and rodents. We find that upscaled metabolic states in active neurons of central memory circuits of flies and mice enable storing long-term memories in training paradigms in which wild-type counterparts of both species fail to remember. Our findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that controls mitochondrial metabolism in active neurons and prove its crucial role in governing higher brain functions, such as long-term memory formation.

Highlights- Letm1 controls activity-driven mitochondrial Ca2&#43; efflux in neurons
- Increased mitochondrial Ca2&#43; retention during activity overactivates neuronal metabolism
- Activity-driven upscaling of neuronal metabolism facilitates long-term olfactory memory in flies and mice</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current models of learning and memory have focused on cell-autonomous regulation of synaptic strength; however, intercellular signaling between cells in the brain is critical for normal cognition. The immediate early gene Arc is a repurposed retrotransposon critical for long-term forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Arc protein forms virus-like capsids released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that signal cell-to-cell. Here, we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) stimuli induce the biogenesis of Arc EVs by recruiting the I-BAR protein IRSp53 to dendrites, which facilitates Arc capsid assembly and release. Arc EVs transfer Arc protein and mRNA to neighboring neurons, where translation of transferred Arc mRNA induces a loss of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These results show that Arc EVs mediate non-cell autonomous long-term depression (LTD), revealing an intercellular form of synaptic plasticity that may be critical for memory consolidation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The primary auditory cortex (ACtx) is critically involved in the association of sensory information with specific behavioral outcomes. Such sensory-guided behaviors are necessarily brain-wide endeavors, requiring a plethora of distinct brain areas, including those that are involved in aspects of decision making, motor planning, motor initiation, and reward prediction. ACtx comprises a number of distinct excitatory cell-types that allow for the brain-wide propagation of behaviorally-relevant sensory information. Exactly how ACtx involvement changes as a function of learning, as well as the functional role of distinct excitatory cell-types is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by designing a two-choice auditory task in which water-restricted, head-fixed mice were trained to categorize the temporal rate of a sinusoidal amplitude modulated (sAM) noise burst and used transient cell-type specific optogenetics to probe ACtx necessity across the duration of learning. Our data demonstrate that ACtx is necessary for the ability to categorize the rate of sAM noise, and this necessity grows across learning. ACtx silencing substantially altered the behavioral strategies used to solve the task by introducing a fluctuating choice bias and increasing dependence on prior decisions. Furthermore, ACtx silencing did not impact the animal&#39;s motor report, suggesting that ACtx is necessary for the conversion of sensation to action. Targeted inhibition of extratelencephalic projections on just 20% of trials had a minimal effect on task performance, but significantly degraded learning. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct cortical cell-types synergistically control auditory-guided behavior and that extratelencephalic neurons play a critical role in learning and plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pial vasculature is the sole source of blood supply to the neocortex. Above the pia is the skull, a vascularized bone marrow with a unique anatomical connection to the brain. Recent developments in tissue clearing have enabled unprecedented mapping of the entire pial and calvarial vasculature. However, what are the absolute flow rates values of those vascular networks? This information cannot accurately be retrieved with the commonly used bioimaging methods. Here, we introduce Pia-FLOW, a new approach based on large-scale fluorescence localization microscopy, to attain hemodynamic imaging of the whole murine pial and calvarial vasculature at frame rates up to 1000 Hz and spatial resolution reaching 5.4 um. Using Pia-FLOW, we provide detailed maps of flow velocity, direction and vascular diameters which can serve as ground-truth data for further studies, advancing our understanding of brain fluid dynamics. Furthermore, Pia-FLOW revealed that the pial vascular network functions as one unit for the robust allocation of blood after stroke.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The serotonin 2 receptor (5HT2R) agonist psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive inflexibility. Psilocybin may accomplish this by inducing rapid and stable dendritic plasticity. However, the impact of psilocybin on patterns of neural activity underlying sustained changes in cognitive and behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test the hypothesis that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by rapidly and persistently altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the retrosplenial cortex across a five-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. Leveraging tensor component analysis to identify neurons that modulate activity on multiple temporal scales, we found that a single-dose of psilocybin induced cortical ensemble turnover between fear learning and extinction days while oppositely modulating activity in fear- and extinction- active neurons. The extent of suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons were both predictive of psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. These results both align with hypotheses that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new populations of neurons and introduce a new mechanism involving the suppression of fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hippocampal place cells fire in sequences that span spatial environments and non-spatial modalities, suggesting that hippocampal activity can anchor to the most behaviorally salient aspects of experience. As reward is a highly salient event, we hypothesized that sequences of hippocampal activity can anchor to rewards. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward- relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward- relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human thalamus is a bilateral and heterogeneous grey matter structure that plays a crucial role in coordinating whole-brain activity. Investigations of its complex structural and functional internal organization revealed to a certain degree overlapping parcellations, however, a consensus on thalamic subnuclei boundaries remains absent. Recent work suggests that thalamic organization might additionally reflect continuous axes transcending nuclear boundaries. In this study, we used a multimodal approach to uncover how low-dimensional axes that describe thalamic connectivity patterns to the cortex are related to internal thalamic microstructural features, functional connectivity, and structural covariance. We computed a thalamocortical structural connectome via probabilistic tractography on diffusion MRI and derived two main axes of thalamic organization. The principal thalamic gradient, extending from medial to lateral and differentiating between transmodal and unimodal nuclei, was related to intrathalamic myelin profiles, and patterns of functional connectivity, while the secondary axis showed correspondence to core-matrix cell type distributions. Lastly, exploring multimodal thalamocortical associations on a global scale, we observed that the medial-to- lateral gradient consistently differentiated limbic, frontoparietal, and default mode network nodes from dorsal and ventral attention networks across modalities. However, the link with sensory modalities varied. In sum, we show the coherence between lower dimensional patterns of thalamocortical structural connectivity and various modalities, shedding light on multiscale thalamic organization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cognition is remarkably flexible; we are able to rapidly learn and perform many different tasks1. Theoretical modeling has shown artificial neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks will re-use representations2 and computational components3 across tasks. By composing tasks from these sub-components, an agent can flexibly switch between tasks and rapidly learn new tasks4. Yet, whether such compositionality is found in the brain is unknown. Here, we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task compositionally combining these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. Neural recordings found task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Subspaces were flexibly engaged as monkeys discovered the task in effect; their internal belief about the current task predicted the strength of representations in task-relevant subspaces. In sum, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations across tasks.</p>
