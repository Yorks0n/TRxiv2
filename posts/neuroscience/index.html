In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x107 chemical synapses between [~]130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.\nA consensus cell type atlas from multiple connectomes reveals principles of circuit stereotypy and variation\nAuthors: Schlegel, P.; Yin, Y.; Bates, A.

E.\nScore: 1083.7, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546055\nThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the \"hemibrain\" connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing \u003e1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.\nA Brain-Wide Map of Neural Activity during Complex Behaviour\nAuthors: International Brain Lab, ; Benson, B.; Benson, J.; Birman, D.; Bonacchi, N.; Carandini, M.; Catarino, J.

It has proven difficult to meet this challenge when different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here, we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 115 mice in 11 labs performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor, and cognitive components, obtained with 547 Neuropixels probe insertions covering 267 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map, assessing how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli appeared transiently in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of mid- and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption versus reward omission were also widespread. Representations of objective prior expectations were weaker, found in sparse sets of neurons from restricted regions. This publicly available dataset represents an unprecedented resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.\nKrause corpuscles of the genitalia are vibrotactile sensors required for normal sexual behavior\nAuthors: Qi, L.; Iskols, M.; Handler, A.; Ginty, D. D.\nScore: 154.0, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.545006\nKrause corpuscles, first discovered in the 1850s, are enigmatic sensory structures with unknown physiological properties and functions found within the genitalia and other mucocutaneous tissues. Here, we identified two distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate Krause corpuscles of the mouse penis and clitoris and project to a unique sensory terminal region of the spinal cord. Using in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we found that both Krause corpuscle afferent types are A-fiber rapid-adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, optimally tuned to dynamic, light touch and mechanical vibrations (40-80 Hz) applied to the clitoris or penis. Optogenetic activation of male Krause corpuscle afferent terminals evoked penile erection, while genetic ablation of Krause corpuscles impaired intromission and ejaculation of males as well as reduced sexual receptivity of females. Thus, Krause corpuscles, which are particularly dense in the clitoris, are vibrotactile sensors crucial for normal sexual behavior.\nA bistable inhibitory OptoGPCR for multiplexed optogenetic control of neural circuits\nAuthors: Wietek, J.; Nozownik, A.; Pulin, M.; Saraf-Sinik, I.; Matosevich, N.; Malan, D.; Brown, B.

S.; Yizhar, O.\nScore: 77.8, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547328\nInformation is transmitted between brain regions through the release of neurotransmitters from long-range projecting axons. Understanding how the activity of such long-range connections contributes to behavior requires efficient methods for reversibly manipulating their function. Chemogenetic and optogenetic tools, acting through endogenous G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) pathways, can be used to modulate synaptic transmission, but existing tools are limited in sensitivity, spatiotemporal precision, or spectral multiplexing capabilities. Here we systematically evaluated multiple bistable opsins for optogenetic applications and found that the Platynereis dumerilii ciliary opsin (PdCO) is an efficient, versatile, light-activated bistable GPCR that can suppress synaptic transmission in mammalian neurons with high temporal precision in-vivo. PdCO has superior biophysical properties that enable spectral multiplexing with other optogenetic actuators and reporters. We demonstrate that PdCO can be used to conduct reversible loss-of-function experiments in long-range projections of behaving animals, thereby enabling detailed synapse-specific functional circuit mapping.\nWhat can 1.8 billion regressions tell us about the pressures shaping high-level visual representation in brains and machines?\nAuthors: Conwell, C.; Prince, J. S.; Kay, K. N.; Alvarez, G. A.; Konkle, T.\nScore: 77.8, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.28.485868\nThe rapid development and open-source release of highly performant computer vision models offers new potential for examining how different inductive biases impact representation learning and emergent alignment with the high-level human ventral visual system. Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.\nPutting cognitive tasks on trial: A measure of reliability convergence\nAuthors: Kadlec, J.; Walsh, C.; Sade, U.; Amir, A.; Rissman, J.; Ramot, M.\nScore: 58.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547563\nThe surge in interest in individual differences has coincided with the latest replication crisis centered around brain-wide association studies of brain-behavior correlations. Yet the reliability of the measures we use in cognitive neuroscience, a crucial component of this brain-behavior relationship, is often assumed but not directly tested. Here, we evaluate the reliability of different cognitive tasks on a large dataset of over 250 participants, who each completed a multi-day task battery. We show how reliability improves as a function of number of trials, and describe the convergence of the reliability curves for the different tasks, allowing us to score tasks according to their suitability for studies of individual differences. To improve the accessibility of these findings, we designed a simple web-based tool that implements this function to calculate the convergence factor and predict the expected reliability for any given number of trials and participants, even based on limited pilot data.\nBrain-wide representations of prior information in mouse decision-making\nAuthors: Findling, C.; Hubert, F.; International Brain Laboratory, ; Acerbi, L.; Benson, B.; Benson, J.; Birman, D.; Bonacchi, N.; Carandini, M.; Catarino, J.

To investigate this issue, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions which, remarkably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (LGd, VISp) to motor regions (MOs, MOp, GRN) and high level cortical regions (ACCd, ORBvl). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision making areas. This study offers the first brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large scale recordings on a single standardized task.\nConverging on consistent functional connectomics\nAuthors: Luppi, A.

A.\nScore: 88.3, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546329\nFunctional interactions between brain regions can be viewed as a network, empowering neuroscientists to leverage network science to investigate distributed brain function. However, obtaining a brain network from functional neuroimaging data involves multiple steps of data manipulation, which can drastically affect the organisation and validity of the estimated brain network and its properties. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 576 unique data-processing pipelines for functional connectomics from resting-state functional MRI, obtained from all possible recombinations of popular choices for brain atlas type and size, connectivity definition and selection, and global signal regression. We use the portrait divergence, an information-theoretic measure of differences in network topology across scales, to quantify the influence of analytic choices on the overall organisation of the derived functional connectome. We evaluate each pipeline across an entire battery of criteria, seeking pipelines that (i) minimise spurious test-retest discrepancies of network topology, while simultaneously (ii) mitigating motion confounds, and being sensitive to both (iii) inter-subject differences and (iv) experimental effects of interest, as demonstrated by propofol-induced general anaesthesia. Our findings reveal vast and systematic variability across pipelines suitability for functional connectomics. Choice of the wrong data-processing pipeline can lead to results that are not only misleading, but systematically so, distorting the functional connectome more drastically than the passage of several months. We also found that the majority of pipelines failed to meet at least one of our criteria. However, we identified 8 candidates satisfying all criteria across each of four independent datasets spanning minutes, weeks, and months, ensuring the generalisability of our recommendations. Our results also generalise to alternative acquisition parameters and preprocessing and denoising choices. By providing the community with a full breakdown of each pipelines performance across this multi-dataset, multi-criteria, multi-scale and multi-step approach, we establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to inform future best practices in functional connectomics.\nVTA dopamine neurons drive spatiotemporally heterogeneous striatal dopamine signals during learning\nAuthors: Engel, L.; Wolff, A. R.; Blake, M.; Collins, V. L.; Sinha, S.; Saunders, B. T.\nScore: 40.3, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547331\nEnvironmental cues, through Pavlovian learning, become conditioned stimuli that guide animals toward the acquisition of rewards (for example, food) by invigorating and directing seeking behavior. Dopamine neurons are crucial for this process, by signaling information related to rewards, as well as associated actions, states, and cues. Dopamine neurons are embedded in a reciprocally connected network with their targets in the striatum, the functional relevance of which remains poorly understood. Here we investigated how cue-evoked behavior generated by dopamine neurons is signaled by dopamine release downstream in striatal subregions and how they evolve across stages of learning. We made use of a genetically encoded dopamine biosensor (dLight) to monitor dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell, dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) with fiber photometry, while tracking detailed movement features during optogenetic Pavlovian cue conditioning of VTA dopamine neurons. We demonstrate spatially heterogeneous, learning-dependent changes across striatal regions. Cues paired with optogenetic activation of VTA dopamine neurons evoked dopamine release preferentially in the NAc core, but not shell, early in training, when behavioral responses were slower and directed toward the cue. Critically, these NAc core signals remained stable, and as training progressed, VTA cue-evoked dopamine signals also emerged in the DMS. Further, prediction error signals, reflecting a violation in the expectation of dopamine neuron activation, only emerged in the NAc core and DMS. Despite the development of rapid, vigorous movement late in training, conditioned dopamine signals did not emerge in the DLS. Together our studies show broad dissociation in the fundamental prediction and reward-related information signaled by dopamine across the striatum. Further, they offer new insight into how larger-scale plasticity across the striatal dopamine network emerges during Pavlovian learning to coordinate behavior.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analyzing electron microscopic (EM) brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x107 chemical synapses between [~]130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the &#34;hemibrain&#34; connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing &gt;1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with prior expectations to initiate movements. It has proven difficult to meet this challenge when different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here, we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 115 mice in 11 labs performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor, and cognitive components, obtained with 547 Neuropixels probe insertions covering 267 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map, assessing how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli appeared transiently in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of mid- and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption versus reward omission were also widespread. Representations of objective prior expectations were weaker, found in sparse sets of neurons from restricted regions. This publicly available dataset represents an unprecedented resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Krause corpuscles, first discovered in the 1850s, are enigmatic sensory structures with unknown physiological properties and functions found within the genitalia and other mucocutaneous tissues. Here, we identified two distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate Krause corpuscles of the mouse penis and clitoris and project to a unique sensory terminal region of the spinal cord. Using in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we found that both Krause corpuscle afferent types are A-fiber rapid-adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, optimally tuned to dynamic, light touch and mechanical vibrations (40-80 Hz) applied to the clitoris or penis. Optogenetic activation of male Krause corpuscle afferent terminals evoked penile erection, while genetic ablation of Krause corpuscles impaired intromission and ejaculation of males as well as reduced sexual receptivity of females. Thus, Krause corpuscles, which are particularly dense in the clitoris, are vibrotactile sensors crucial for normal sexual behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Information is transmitted between brain regions through the release of neurotransmitters from long-range projecting axons. Understanding how the activity of such long-range connections contributes to behavior requires efficient methods for reversibly manipulating their function. Chemogenetic and optogenetic tools, acting through endogenous G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) pathways, can be used to modulate synaptic transmission, but existing tools are limited in sensitivity, spatiotemporal precision, or spectral multiplexing capabilities. Here we systematically evaluated multiple bistable opsins for optogenetic applications and found that the Platynereis dumerilii ciliary opsin (PdCO) is an efficient, versatile, light-activated bistable GPCR that can suppress synaptic transmission in mammalian neurons with high temporal precision in-vivo. PdCO has superior biophysical properties that enable spectral multiplexing with other optogenetic actuators and reporters. We demonstrate that PdCO can be used to conduct reversible loss-of-function experiments in long-range projections of behaving animals, thereby enabling detailed synapse-specific functional circuit mapping.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid development and open-source release of highly performant computer vision models offers new potential for examining how different inductive biases impact representation learning and emergent alignment with the high-level human ventral visual system. Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The surge in interest in individual differences has coincided with the latest replication crisis centered around brain-wide association studies of brain-behavior correlations. Yet the reliability of the measures we use in cognitive neuroscience, a crucial component of this brain-behavior relationship, is often assumed but not directly tested. Here, we evaluate the reliability of different cognitive tasks on a large dataset of over 250 participants, who each completed a multi-day task battery. We show how reliability improves as a function of number of trials, and describe the convergence of the reliability curves for the different tasks, allowing us to score tasks according to their suitability for studies of individual differences. To improve the accessibility of these findings, we designed a simple web-based tool that implements this function to calculate the convergence factor and predict the expected reliability for any given number of trials and participants, even based on limited pilot data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions which, remarkably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (LGd, VISp) to motor regions (MOs, MOp, GRN) and high level cortical regions (ACCd, ORBvl). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision making areas. This study offers the first brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large scale recordings on a single standardized task.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Functional interactions between brain regions can be viewed as a network, empowering neuroscientists to leverage network science to investigate distributed brain function. However, obtaining a brain network from functional neuroimaging data involves multiple steps of data manipulation, which can drastically affect the organisation and validity of the estimated brain network and its properties. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 576 unique data-processing pipelines for functional connectomics from resting-state functional MRI, obtained from all possible recombinations of popular choices for brain atlas type and size, connectivity definition and selection, and global signal regression. We use the portrait divergence, an information-theoretic measure of differences in network topology across scales, to quantify the influence of analytic choices on the overall organisation of the derived functional connectome. We evaluate each pipeline across an entire battery of criteria, seeking pipelines that (i) minimise spurious test-retest discrepancies of network topology, while simultaneously (ii) mitigating motion confounds, and being sensitive to both (iii) inter-subject differences and (iv) experimental effects of interest, as demonstrated by propofol-induced general anaesthesia. Our findings reveal vast and systematic variability across pipelines suitability for functional connectomics. Choice of the wrong data-processing pipeline can lead to results that are not only misleading, but systematically so, distorting the functional connectome more drastically than the passage of several months. We also found that the majority of pipelines failed to meet at least one of our criteria. However, we identified 8 candidates satisfying all criteria across each of four independent datasets spanning minutes, weeks, and months, ensuring the generalisability of our recommendations. Our results also generalise to alternative acquisition parameters and preprocessing and denoising choices. By providing the community with a full breakdown of each pipelines performance across this multi-dataset, multi-criteria, multi-scale and multi-step approach, we establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to inform future best practices in functional connectomics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental cues, through Pavlovian learning, become conditioned stimuli that guide animals toward the acquisition of rewards (for example, food) by invigorating and directing seeking behavior. Dopamine neurons are crucial for this process, by signaling information related to rewards, as well as associated actions, states, and cues. Dopamine neurons are embedded in a reciprocally connected network with their targets in the striatum, the functional relevance of which remains poorly understood. Here we investigated how cue-evoked behavior generated by dopamine neurons is signaled by dopamine release downstream in striatal subregions and how they evolve across stages of learning. We made use of a genetically encoded dopamine biosensor (dLight) to monitor dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell, dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) with fiber photometry, while tracking detailed movement features during optogenetic Pavlovian cue conditioning of VTA dopamine neurons. We demonstrate spatially heterogeneous, learning-dependent changes across striatal regions. Cues paired with optogenetic activation of VTA dopamine neurons evoked dopamine release preferentially in the NAc core, but not shell, early in training, when behavioral responses were slower and directed toward the cue. Critically, these NAc core signals remained stable, and as training progressed, VTA cue-evoked dopamine signals also emerged in the DMS. Further, prediction error signals, reflecting a violation in the expectation of dopamine neuron activation, only emerged in the NAc core and DMS. Despite the development of rapid, vigorous movement late in training, conditioned dopamine signals did not emerge in the DLS. Together our studies show broad dissociation in the fundamental prediction and reward-related information signaled by dopamine across the striatum. Further, they offer new insight into how larger-scale plasticity across the striatal dopamine network emerges during Pavlovian learning to coordinate behavior.</p>
