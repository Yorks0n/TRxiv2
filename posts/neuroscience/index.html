S.; McMannon, B.; Lee, J.; Hoag, A. T.; Lynch, L. A.; Janarthanan, S. N.; Lopez Luna, J. F.; Bondy, A. G.; Falkner, A. L.; Wang, S. S.-H.; Witten, I. B.\nScore: 47.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561214\nAnimals learn the value of foods based on their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1-6 and preferences to those that are nutritious7-14. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavors experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for postingestive reactivation of neural flavor representations in this temporal credit assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel15-18, but not familiar, flavors with delayed gastric malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavors that support aversive postingestive learning. Surveying cellular resolution brainwide activation patterns reveals that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavors across every stage of the learning process: the initial meal, delayed malaise, and memory retrieval. By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of genetically defined hindbrain malaise cells, we find that postingestive malaise signals potently and specifically reactivate amygdalar novel flavor representations from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts strengthening of flavor responses upon memory retrieval, leading to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavor. In contrast, meals without postingestive consequences degrade neural flavor representations as flavors become familiar and safe. Thus, our findings demonstrate that interoceptive reactivation of amygdalar flavor representations provides a neural mechanism to resolve the temporal credit assignment problem inherent to postingestive learning.\nNeural correlates of visual object recognition in rats\nAuthors: Rhee, J. Y.; Echavarria, C.; Soucy, E.; Greenwood, J.; Masis, J. A.; Cox, D. D.\nScore: 31.4, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.555183\nInvariant object recognition--the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context--is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Although initially believed to be unique to primates due to its complexity, emerging evidence suggests rodents, too, can recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. Here, we describe a comprehensive pipeline for investigating visual behavior in rats, from high-throughput training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Using this suite of tools, we demonstrate that rats excel in visual object recognition and explore potential neural pathways which may support this capacity. We leverage our optical approach to systematically profile multiple visual areas with responses to a range of stimulus types recorded in the same neurons. Primary and higher-order areas of rat visual cortex exhibit a hierarchical organization consistent with a role in visual object recognition. However, marked deviations from the functional organization of primate visual cortex suggest species-specific differences in the neural circuits underlying visual object recognition. This work reinforces the notion that rats possess sophisticated visual abilities and offers the technical foundation for their use as a powerful model to link neuronal responses to perception and behavior.\nRepresentations of information value in mouse orbitofrontal cortex during information seeking\nAuthors: Bussell, J. J.; Badman, R. P.; Marton, C. D.; Bromberg-Martin, E. S.; Abbott, L.; Rajan, K.; Axel, R.\nScore: 28.6, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562291\nAnimals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.\nAstrocytes Control Recent and Remote Memory Strength by Affecting the Recruitment of the CA1-\u003eACC Projection to Engrams\nAuthors: Refaeli, R.; Kreisel, T.; Groysman, M.; Goshen, I.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-10-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561396\nRecent and remote memories are encoded throughout the brain in Engrams: cell ensembles formed during acquisition, and upon their reactivation, a specific memory can be recalled. The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC). Various modifications to CA1 astrocytes, to the Gq- or Gi-GPCR pathways, during memory acquisition were shown to affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address the inconsistency, we applied transgenic approaches for ensemble identification, CLARITY, retro-AAV virus for circuit mapping, and chemogenetics in astrocytes for functional investigation. We manipulated the activity of either Gq- or Gi-pathways in CA1 astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged cFos+ engram cells and CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC cells during recent and remote recall in the same animals. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC projection cells to the engram, demonstrated by the number of CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC projecting cells in the engram as well as the number of axons projecting from the CA1 engram toward the ACC: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, when activating the Gi pathway in astrocytes during acquisition, only remote recall was impaired, and CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that astrocytes control behavioral performance by targeting the CA1[-\u0026gt;]ACC projection. Specifically, that Gq- and Gi-pathway activation affect memory differently, but do so by modulating the same mechanism. These findings illuminate the importance of astrocytes in the acquisition of fear memory and their implications on recent and remote recall.\nWhole-cortex in situ sequencing reveals peripheral input-dependent cell type-defined area identity\nAuthors: Chen, X.; Fischer, S.; Rue, M. C.; Zhang, A.; Mukherjee, D.; Kanold, P. O.; Gillis, J.; Zador, A.\nScore: 144.9, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.06.515380\nThe cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.\nMulti-donor human cortical Chimeroids reveal individual susceptibility to neurotoxic triggers\nAuthors: Anton-Bolanos, N.; Faravelli, I.; Faits, T.; Andreadis, S.; Trattaro, S.; Kastli, R.; Adiconis, X.; Di Bella, D. J.; Tegtmeyer, M.; Nehme, R.; Levin, J. Z.; Regev, A.; Arlotta, P.\nScore: 36.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.558331\nInter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain \"Chimeroids\", a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.\nCell type-focused compound screen in human organoids reveals molecules and pathways controlling cone photoreceptor death\nAuthors: Spirig, S.

However, such screens have not yet been performed. Here, we generated 20,000 human retinal organoids with GFP-labeled cone photoreceptors. Since degeneration of cones is a leading cause of blindness, we induced cone death and screened 2,707 compounds with known targets, for those that saved cones or those that further damaged cones. We identified kinase inhibitors that protected cones in both the short and longer term, HSP90 inhibitors that saved cones in the short term but damaged them in the longer term, and broad HDAC inhibition by many compounds that significantly damaged cones. This resource provides a database for cone-damaging compounds, and it describes compounds that can be starting points to develop neuroprotection for cones in diseases such as macular degeneration.\nAminergic and peptidergic modulation of Insulin-Producing Cells in Drosophila\nAuthors: Held, M.; Bisen, R. S.; Zandawala, M. M.; Chockley, A. S.; Balles, I. S.; Hilpert, S.; Liessem, S.; Cascino-Milani, F.; Ache, J. M.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557555\nInsulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands change momentarily, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated via various pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory pathways. Here, we analyzed how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in Drosophila - a population of Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized the functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, and an optogenetics-based \"intrinsic pharmacology\" approach. Our results showed that the IPC population expressed a variety of receptors for neuromodulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, individual IPCs exhibited heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that they could be modulated differentially. This was supported by electrophysiological recordings of IPCs that we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs had heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibited one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occurred simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted the IPCs towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level framework of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of Drosophila.\nA suite of engineered mice for interrogating psychedelic drug actions\nAuthors: Chiu, Y.-t.; Deutch, A.; Wang, W.; Schmitz, G. P.; Huang, K.; Kocak, D.; Lorach, P.; Bowye, K.; Liu, B.; Sciaky, N.; Hua, K.; Chen, C.; Mott, S.; Niehaus, J.; DiBerto, J.; English, J.; Walsh, J.; Scherrer, G.; Herman, M.; Wu, Z.; Wetsel, W. C.; Roth, B. L.\nScore: 95.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559347\nPsychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.\nWidespread drastic reduction of brain myelin content upon prolonged endurance exercise\nAuthors: Ramos-Cabrer, P.; Cabrera, A.; Padro, D.; Matute-Gonzalez, M.; Rodriguez-Antiguedad, A.; Matute, C.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561303\nRecent evidence suggests that myelin lipids may act as glial energy reserves when glucose is lacking, a hypothesis yet to be solidly proven. Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Animals learn the value of foods based on their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1-6 and preferences to those that are nutritious7-14. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavors experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for postingestive reactivation of neural flavor representations in this temporal credit assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel15-18, but not familiar, flavors with delayed gastric malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavors that support aversive postingestive learning. Surveying cellular resolution brainwide activation patterns reveals that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavors across every stage of the learning process: the initial meal, delayed malaise, and memory retrieval. By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of genetically defined hindbrain malaise cells, we find that postingestive malaise signals potently and specifically reactivate amygdalar novel flavor representations from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts strengthening of flavor responses upon memory retrieval, leading to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavor. In contrast, meals without postingestive consequences degrade neural flavor representations as flavors become familiar and safe. Thus, our findings demonstrate that interoceptive reactivation of amygdalar flavor representations provides a neural mechanism to resolve the temporal credit assignment problem inherent to postingestive learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invariant object recognition--the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context--is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Although initially believed to be unique to primates due to its complexity, emerging evidence suggests rodents, too, can recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. Here, we describe a comprehensive pipeline for investigating visual behavior in rats, from high-throughput training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Using this suite of tools, we demonstrate that rats excel in visual object recognition and explore potential neural pathways which may support this capacity. We leverage our optical approach to systematically profile multiple visual areas with responses to a range of stimulus types recorded in the same neurons. Primary and higher-order areas of rat visual cortex exhibit a hierarchical organization consistent with a role in visual object recognition. However, marked deviations from the functional organization of primate visual cortex suggest species-specific differences in the neural circuits underlying visual object recognition. This work reinforces the notion that rats possess sophisticated visual abilities and offers the technical foundation for their use as a powerful model to link neuronal responses to perception and behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent and remote memories are encoded throughout the brain in  Engrams: cell ensembles formed during acquisition, and upon their reactivation, a specific memory can be recalled. The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC). Various modifications to CA1 astrocytes, to the Gq- or Gi-GPCR pathways, during memory acquisition were shown to affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address the inconsistency, we applied transgenic approaches for ensemble identification, CLARITY, retro-AAV virus for circuit mapping, and chemogenetics in astrocytes for functional investigation. We manipulated the activity of either Gq- or Gi-pathways in CA1 astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged cFos&#43; engram cells and CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC cells during recent and remote recall in the same animals. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC projection cells to the engram, demonstrated by the number of CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC projecting cells in the engram as well as the number of axons projecting from the CA1 engram toward the ACC: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, when activating the Gi pathway in astrocytes during acquisition, only remote recall was impaired, and CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that astrocytes control behavioral performance by targeting the CA1[-&amp;gt;]ACC projection. Specifically, that Gq- and Gi-pathway activation affect memory differently, but do so by modulating the same mechanism. These findings illuminate the importance of astrocytes in the acquisition of fear memory and their implications on recent and remote recall.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain &#34;Chimeroids&#34;, a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human organoids that mirror their corresponding organs in cell-type diversity present an opportunity to perform large-scale screens for compounds that protect disease-affected or damage healthy cell types. However, such screens have not yet been performed. Here, we generated 20,000 human retinal organoids with GFP-labeled cone photoreceptors. Since degeneration of cones is a leading cause of blindness, we induced cone death and screened 2,707 compounds with known targets, for those that saved cones or those that further damaged cones. We identified kinase inhibitors that protected cones in both the short and longer term, HSP90 inhibitors that saved cones in the short term but damaged them in the longer term, and broad HDAC inhibition by many compounds that significantly damaged cones. This resource provides a database for cone-damaging compounds, and it describes compounds that can be starting points to develop neuroprotection for cones in diseases such as macular degeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands change momentarily, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated via various pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory pathways. Here, we analyzed how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in Drosophila - a population of Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized the functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, and an optogenetics-based &#34;intrinsic pharmacology&#34; approach. Our results showed that the IPC population expressed a variety of receptors for neuromodulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, individual IPCs exhibited heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that they could be modulated differentially. This was supported by electrophysiological recordings of IPCs that we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs had heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibited one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occurred simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted the IPCs towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level framework of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent evidence suggests that myelin lipids may act as glial energy reserves when glucose is lacking, a hypothesis yet to be solidly proven. Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.</p>
