While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.\nA suite of engineered mice for interrogating psychedelic drug actions\nAuthors: Chiu, Y.-t.; Deutch, A.; Wang, W.; Schmitz, G. P.; Huang, K.; Kocak, D.; Lorach, P.; Bowye, K.; Liu, B.; Sciaky, N.; Hua, K.; Chen, C.; Mott, S.; Niehaus, J.; DiBerto, J.; English, J.; Walsh, J.; Scherrer, G.; Herman, M.; Wu, Z.; Wetsel, W. C.; Roth, B. L.\nScore: 79.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559347\nPsychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.\nSerotonin predictively encodes value\nAuthors: Harkin, E. F.; Grossman, C. D.; Cohen, J. Y.; Beïque, J.-C.; Naud, R.\nScore: 46.3, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558526\nThe in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision \u003c\u003c0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.\nNeural circuit mechanisms underlying context-specific halting in Drosophila.\nAuthors: Sapkal, N.; Mancini, N.; Kumar, D. S.; Spiller, N.; Murakami, K.; Vitelli, G.; Bargeron, B.; Maier, K.; Eichler, K.; Jefferis, G. S. X. E.; Shiu, P.; Sterne, G. R.; Bidaye, S. S.\nScore: 31.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559438\nWalking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical but often overlooked component of walking control. While recent studies have delineated specific genetically defined neuronal populations in the mouse brainstem that drive different types of halting, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking-state neural activity to generate context-appropriate halting, remain unclear. Here, we elucidate two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (\"walk-OFF\" mechanism) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, while the second mechanism (\"brake\" mechanism) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve-cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. Using connectome-informed models and functional studies, we show that two neuronal types that deploy the \"walk-OFF\" mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward-walking or steering. The \"brake\" neurons on the other hand, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking promoting pathways and increasing the resistance at the leg-joints leading to an arrest of leg movements in the stance phase of walking. We characterized two ethologically relevant behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the \"walk-OFF\" pathway was engaged for halting during feeding, and the \"brake\" pathway was engaged for halting during grooming. Furthermore, this knowledge of the neural targets and mechanisms for halting, allowed us to use connectomics to predict novel halting pathways that could be relevant in other behavioral contexts.\nSensory experience steers representational drift in mouse visual cortex\nAuthors: Bauer, J.; Lewin, U.; Herbert, E.; Gjorgjieva, J.; Schoonover, C. E.; Fink, A. J. P.; Rose, T.; Bonhoeffer, T.; Hübener, M.\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558966\nRepresentational drift - the gradual continuous change of neuronal representations - has been observed across many brain areas. It is unclear whether this drift is caused by synaptic plasticity elicited by sensory experience, or by the intrinsic volatility of synapses. Here, using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex, we find that the preferred stimulus orientation of individual neurons slowly drifts over the course of weeks. By using cylinder lens goggles to limit visual experience to a narrow range of orientations, we show that the direction of drift, but not its magnitude, is biased by the statistics of visual input. A network model suggests that drift of preferred orientation largely results from synaptic volatility, which under normal visual conditions is counteracted by experience-driven Hebbian mechanisms, stabilizing preferred orientation. Under deprivation conditions these Hebbian mechanisms enable adaptation. Thus, Hebbian synaptic plasticity steers drift to match the statistics of the environment.\nNeocortico-hippocampal ripple-based coordination during naturalistic encoding\nAuthors: Silva, M.; Wu, X.; Sabio, M.; Conde-Blanco, E.; Roldan, P.; Donaire, A.; Carreno, M.; Axmacher, N.; Baldassano, C.; Fuentemilla, L.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559739\nMemory formation relies on effective communication between the hippocampus and neocortical areas. Ripples have been proposed as a key neural signature facilitating information transmission in the brain. However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored. Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie. Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and in neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex). Our results revealed a coordinated neocortico-hippocampal ripple-based interaction during encoding. However, this interaction exhibited distinct timing patterns: ripples in the temporal cortex preceded those from the hippocampus which then preceded those from frontal cortex. Additionally, enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the role of ripples in event segmentation, suggesting their potential role in forming long-term memories of distinct episodes.\nHierarchical VAEs provide a normative account of motion processing in the primate brain\nAuthors: Vafaii, H.; Yates, J. L.; Butts, D. A.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559646\nThe relationship between perception and inference, as postulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century, is paralleled in modern machine learning by generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their hierarchical variants. Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We introduce a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We found that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth variables and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses with a performance gain of over 2x and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. Finally, these results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Collectively, these results support the notion that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlies the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs offer an effective means of capturing this understanding.\nBrainLM: A foundation model for brain activity recordings\nAuthors: Ortega Caro, J.; Oliveira Fonseca, A. H.; Averill, C.; Rizvi, S. A.; Rosati, M.; Cross, J. L.; Mittal, P.; Zappala, E.; Levine, D.; Dhodapkar, R. M.; Abdallah, C. G.; van Dijk, D.\nScore: 66.9, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557460\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe introduce the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), a foundation model for brain activity dynamics trained on 6,700 hours of fMRI recordings. Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, BrainLM demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the prediction of clinical variables and future brain states. In zero-shot inference, the model identifies functional networks and generates interpretable latent representations of neural activity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompting technique, allowing BrainLM to function as an in silico simulator of brain activity responses to perturbations. BrainLM offers a novel framework for the analysis and understanding of large-scale brain activity data, serving as a \"lens\" through which new data can be more effectively interpreted.\nThe microcephaly gene ASPM is required for the timely generation of human outer-radial glia progenitors by controlling mitotic spindle orientation\nAuthors: van Benthem, A.; Limame, R.; Piumatti, M.; Erkol, E.; Zaratin, M.; Tanaka, D.; Herpoel, A.; Bilheu, A.; van Berthem, H.; Nebreda, L.; Matthijs, G.; Keymolen, K.; Poovathingal, S.; Ditkowska, M.; Passemard, S.; Abramowicz, M.; Ledent, C.; Vanderhaeghen, P.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559314\nAbnormal spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) is the most commonly mutated gene in primary microcephaly (MCPH), characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual deficiency. The mechanisms underlying MCPH have remained unclear, as ASPM disruption leads to distinct phenotypes depending on the species studied. Here, we studied the impact of ASPM pathogenic mutations on human corticogenesis in organoid models. We found that at earliest stages of neurogenesis, ASPM mutant cortical progenitors, located at the apical surface of the neuroepithelium, display transient mitotic spindle randomization. The mutant progenitors then delaminate basally to adopt precociously the characteristics of outer radial glia cells (oRGC), a population of progenitors selectively amplified in human corticogenesis. Subsequently, cortical progenitors are depleted through decreased amplification and increased apoptosis. Thus, ASPM regulates the timely generation of oRGC by controlling mitotic spindle orientation, shedding light on how species-specific features of neurogenesis may confer vulnerability to neurodevelopmental diseases.\nRegularized partial correlation provides reliable functional connectivity estimates while correcting for widespread confounding\nAuthors: Peterson, K. L.; Sanchez-Romero, R.; Mill, R. D.; Cole, M. W.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558065\nFunctional connectivity (FC) has been invaluable for understanding the brains communication network, with strong potential for enhanced FC approaches to yield additional insights. Unlike with the fMRI field-standard method of pairwise correlation, theory suggests that partial correlation can estimate FC without confounded and indirect connections. However, partial correlation FC can also display low repeat reliability, impairing the accuracy of individual estimates. We hypothesized that reliability would be increased by adding regularization, which can reduce overfitting to noise in regression-based approaches like partial correlation. We therefore tested several regularized alternatives - graphical lasso, graphical ridge, and principal component regression - against unregularized partial and pairwise correlation, applying them to empirical resting-state fMRI and simulated data. As hypothesized, regularization vastly improved reliability, quantified using between-session similarity and intraclass correlation. This enhanced reliability then granted substantially more accurate individual FC estimates when validated against structural connectivity (empirical data) and ground truth networks (simulations). Graphical lasso showed especially high accuracy among regularized approaches, seemingly by maintaining more valid underlying network structures. We additionally found graphical lasso to be robust to noise levels, data quantity, and subject motion - common fMRI error sources. Lastly, we demonstrated that resting-state graphical lasso FC can effectively predict fMRI task activations and individual differences in behavior, further establishing its reliability, external validity, and ability to characterize task-related functionality. We recommend graphical lasso or similar regularized methods for calculating FC, as they can yield more valid estimates of unconfounded connectivity than field-standard pairwise correlation, while overcoming the poor reliability of unregularized partial correlation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">With the omnipresence of social media, Boys Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision &lt;&lt;0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Walking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical but often overlooked component of walking control. While recent studies have delineated specific genetically defined neuronal populations in the mouse brainstem that drive different types of halting, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking-state neural activity to generate context-appropriate halting, remain unclear. Here, we elucidate two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (&#34;walk-OFF&#34; mechanism) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, while the second mechanism (&#34;brake&#34; mechanism) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve-cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. Using connectome-informed models and functional studies, we show that two neuronal types that deploy the &#34;walk-OFF&#34; mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward-walking or steering. The &#34;brake&#34; neurons on the other hand, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking promoting pathways and increasing the resistance at the leg-joints leading to an arrest of leg movements in the stance phase of walking. We characterized two ethologically relevant behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the &#34;walk-OFF&#34; pathway was engaged for halting during feeding, and the &#34;brake&#34; pathway was engaged for halting during grooming. Furthermore, this knowledge of the neural targets and mechanisms for halting, allowed us to use connectomics to predict novel halting pathways that could be relevant in other behavioral contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Representational drift - the gradual continuous change of neuronal representations - has been observed across many brain areas. It is unclear whether this drift is caused by synaptic plasticity elicited by sensory experience, or by the intrinsic volatility of synapses. Here, using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex, we find that the preferred stimulus orientation of individual neurons slowly drifts over the course of weeks. By using cylinder lens goggles to limit visual experience to a narrow range of orientations, we show that the direction of drift, but not its magnitude, is biased by the statistics of visual input. A network model suggests that drift of preferred orientation largely results from synaptic volatility, which under normal visual conditions is counteracted by experience-driven Hebbian mechanisms, stabilizing preferred orientation. Under deprivation conditions these Hebbian mechanisms enable adaptation. Thus, Hebbian synaptic plasticity steers drift to match the statistics of the environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memory formation relies on effective communication between the hippocampus and neocortical areas. Ripples have been proposed as a key neural signature facilitating information transmission in the brain. However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored. Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie. Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and in neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex). Our results revealed a coordinated neocortico-hippocampal ripple-based interaction during encoding. However, this interaction exhibited distinct timing patterns: ripples in the temporal cortex preceded those from the hippocampus which then preceded those from frontal cortex. Additionally, enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the role of ripples in event segmentation, suggesting their potential role in forming long-term memories of distinct episodes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relationship between perception and inference, as postulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century, is paralleled in modern machine learning by generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their hierarchical variants. Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We introduce a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We found that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth variables and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses with a performance gain of over 2x and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. Finally, these results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Collectively, these results support the notion that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlies the brain&#39;s understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs offer an effective means of capturing this understanding.</p>

Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, BrainLM demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the prediction of clinical variables and future brain states. In zero-shot inference, the model identifies functional networks and generates interpretable latent representations of neural activity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompting technique, allowing BrainLM to function as an in silico simulator of brain activity responses to perturbations. BrainLM offers a novel framework for the analysis and understanding of large-scale brain activity data, serving as a &#34;lens&#34; through which new data can be more effectively interpreted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) is the most commonly mutated gene in primary microcephaly (MCPH), characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual deficiency. The mechanisms underlying MCPH have remained unclear, as ASPM disruption leads to distinct phenotypes depending on the species studied. Here, we studied the impact of ASPM pathogenic mutations on human corticogenesis in organoid models. We found that at earliest stages of neurogenesis, ASPM mutant cortical progenitors, located at the apical surface of the neuroepithelium, display transient mitotic spindle randomization. The mutant progenitors then delaminate basally to adopt precociously the characteristics of outer radial glia cells (oRGC), a population of progenitors selectively amplified in human corticogenesis. Subsequently, cortical progenitors are depleted through decreased amplification and increased apoptosis. Thus, ASPM regulates the timely generation of oRGC by controlling mitotic spindle orientation, shedding light on how species-specific features of neurogenesis may confer vulnerability to neurodevelopmental diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Functional connectivity (FC) has been invaluable for understanding the brains communication network, with strong potential for enhanced FC approaches to yield additional insights. Unlike with the fMRI field-standard method of pairwise correlation, theory suggests that partial correlation can estimate FC without confounded and indirect connections. However, partial correlation FC can also display low repeat reliability, impairing the accuracy of individual estimates. We hypothesized that reliability would be increased by adding regularization, which can reduce overfitting to noise in regression-based approaches like partial correlation. We therefore tested several regularized alternatives - graphical lasso, graphical ridge, and principal component regression - against unregularized partial and pairwise correlation, applying them to empirical resting-state fMRI and simulated data. As hypothesized, regularization vastly improved reliability, quantified using between-session similarity and intraclass correlation. This enhanced reliability then granted substantially more accurate individual FC estimates when validated against structural connectivity (empirical data) and ground truth networks (simulations). Graphical lasso showed especially high accuracy among regularized approaches, seemingly by maintaining more valid underlying network structures. We additionally found graphical lasso to be robust to noise levels, data quantity, and subject motion - common fMRI error sources. Lastly, we demonstrated that resting-state graphical lasso FC can effectively predict fMRI task activations and individual differences in behavior, further establishing its reliability, external validity, and ability to characterize task-related functionality. We recommend graphical lasso or similar regularized methods for calculating FC, as they can yield more valid estimates of unconfounded connectivity than field-standard pairwise correlation, while overcoming the poor reliability of unregularized partial correlation.</p>
