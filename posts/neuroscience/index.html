M.; Schaper, F. L.; Siddiqi, S. H.; Anderson, J. S.; Nielsen, J. A.; Bateman, J. R.; Grafman, J.; Fox, M. D.\nScore: 172.6, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572527\nReligious fundamentalism, characterized by rigid adherence to a set of beliefs putatively revealing inerrant truths, is ubiquitous across cultures and has a global impact on society. Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobes. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets (r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-induced conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with hemispheric specializations in reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.\nComment on 'Accumbens cholinergic interneurons dynamically promote dopamine release and enable motivation'\nAuthors: Taniguchi, J.; Melani, R.; Chantranupong, L.; Wen, M. J.; Mohebi, A.; Berke, J. D.; Sabatini, B. L.; Tritsch, N. X.\nScore: 66.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573485\nAcetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.\nPrinciples of visual cortex excitatory microcircuit organization\nAuthors: Chou, C. Y. C.; Wong, H. H.-W.; Guo, C.; Boukoulou, K. E.; Huang, C.; Jannat, J.; Klimenko, T.; Li, V. Y.; Liang, T. A.; Wu, V. C.; Sjöström, P. J.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573666\nMicrocircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

R.; Heslin, K. A.; Stoll, F. M.; Hof, P. R.; Clem, R. L.; Rudebeck, P. H.\nScore: 36.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571711\nShort abstractThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects to the frontal cortex (FC) in both rodents and primates, but the comparative organization of single-neuron BLA-FC projections is unknown. Using a barcoded connectomic approach, we found that BLA neurons are more likely to project to multiple distinct parts of FC in mice than in macaques. Further, while single BLA neuron projections to nucleus accumbens are similarly organized in mice and macaques, BLA-FC connections differ.\nBasolateral amygdala population coding of a cued reward seeking state depends on orbitofrontal cortex\nAuthors: Ottenheimer, D. J.; Vitale, K. R.; Ambroggi, F.; Janak, P. H.; Saunders, B. T.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573789\nBasolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely linked to the expression of conditioned behavior. An area of increasing interest is how the dynamics of BLA neurons relate to evolving behavior. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking and employed population-level analyses to assess ongoing neural dynamics. We found that, with training, sustained cue-evoked activity emerged that discriminated between the CS+ and CS- and correlated with conditioned responding. This sustained population activity continued until reward receipt and rapidly extinguished along with conditioned behavior during extinction. To assess the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to BLA, to this component of BLA neural activity, we inactivated OFC while recording in BLA and found blunted sustained cue-evoked activity in BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data suggest that sustained cue-driven activity in BLA, which in part depends on OFC input, underlies a conditioned reward-seeking state.\nThe brainstem's red nucleus was evolutionarily upgraded to support goal-directed action\nAuthors: Krimmel, S. R.; Laumann, T. O.; Chauvin, R.; Hershey, T.; Roland, J. L.; Shimony, J. S.; Willie, J. T.; Norris, S. A.; Marek, S.; Van, A. N.; Monk, J.; Scheidter, K. M.; Whiting, F.; Ramirez-Perez, N.; Metoki, A.; Wang, A.; Kay, B. P.; Nahman-Averbuch, H.; Fair, D. A.; Lynch, C. J.; Raichle, M. E.; Gordon, E. M.; Dosenbach, N. U. F.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573730\nThe red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N ~ 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity. Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a 'motor' structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.\nA targeted CRISPR-Cas9 mediated F0 screen identifies genes involved in establishment of the enteric nervous system\nAuthors: Moreno-Campos, R.; Singleton, E. W.; Uribe, R. A.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573581\nThe vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) is a crucial network of enteric neurons and glia resident within the entire gastrointestinal tract (GI). Overseeing essential GI functions such as gut motility and water balance, the ENS serves as a pivotal bidirectional link in the gut-brain axis. During early development, the ENS is primarily derived from enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Disruptions to ENCC development, as seen in conditions like Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), lead to absence of ENS in the GI, particularly in the colon. In this study, using zebrafish, we devised an in vivo F0 CRISPR-based screen employing a robust, rapid pipeline integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR reverse genetics, and high-content imaging. Our findings unveil various genes, including those encoding for opioid receptors, as possible regulators of ENS establishment. In addition, we present evidence that suggests opioid receptor involvement in neurochemical coding of the larval ENS. In summary, our work presents a novel, efficient CRISPR screen targeting ENS development, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown genes, and increasing knowledge of nervous system construction.\nA spectrum of altered non-rapid eye movement sleep in schizophrenia\nAuthors: Kozhemiako, N.; Jiang, C.; Sun, Y.; Guo, Z.; Chapman, S.; Gai, G.; Wang, Z.; Zhou, L.; Li, S.; Law, R. G.; Wang, L. A.; Mylonas, D.; Shen, L.; Murphy, M.; Qin, S.; Zhu, W.; Zhou, Z.; Stickgold, R.; Huang, H.; Tan, S.; Manoach, D. S.; Wang, J.; Hall, M.-H.; Pan, J. Q.; Purcell, S. M.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573548\nBackgroundMultiple facets of sleep neurophysiology, including electroencephalography (EEG) metrics such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles and slow oscillations (SO), are altered in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, beyond group-level analyses which treat all patients as a unitary set, the extent to which NREM deficits vary among patients is unclear, as are their relationships to other sources of heterogeneity including clinical factors, illness duration and ageing, cognitive profiles and medication regimens. Using newly collected high density sleep EEG data on 103 individuals with SCZ and 68 controls, we first sought to replicate our previously reported (Kozhemiako et. al, 2022) group-level mean differences between patients and controls (original N=130). Then in the combined sample (N=301 including 175 patients), we characterized patient-to-patient variability in NREM neurophysiology. ResultsWe replicated all group-level mean differences and confirmed the high accuracy of our predictive model (Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC = 0.93 for diagnosis). Compared to controls, patients showed significantly increased between-individual variability across many (26%) sleep metrics, with patterns only partially recapitulating those for group-level mean differences. Although multiple clinical and cognitive factors were associated with NREM metrics including spindle density, collectively they did not account for much of the general increase in patient-to-patient variability. Medication regimen was a greater (albeit still partial) contributor to variability, although original group mean differences persisted after controlling for medications. Some sleep metrics including fast spindle density showed exaggerated age-related effects in SCZ, and patients exhibited older predicted biological ages based on an independent model of ageing and the sleep EEG. ConclusionWe demonstrated robust and replicable alterations in sleep neurophysiology in individuals with SCZ and highlighted distinct patterns of effects contrasting between-group means versus within-group variances. We further documented and controlled for a major effect of medication use, and pointed to greater age-related change in NREM sleep in patients. That increased NREM heterogeneity was not explained by standard clinical or cognitive patient assessments suggests the sleep EEG provides novel, nonredundant information to support the goals of personalized medicine. Collectively, our results point to a spectrum of NREM sleep deficits among SCZ patients that can be measured objectively and at scale, and that may offer a unique window on the etiological and genetic diversity that underlies SCZ risk, treatment response and prognosis.\nGliogenesis from the subventricular zone modulates the extracellular matrix at the glial scar after brain ischemia\nAuthors: Ardaya, M.; Tiveron, M.-C.; Cremer, H.; Dehay, B.; Perez-Cerda, F.; Matute, C.; Soria, F. N.; Cavaliere, F.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573719\nActivation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) after cerebral ischemia is one of the early responses in the brain to counteract the loss of neurons and reduce tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through many chemotactic messages that result in neural stem cells (NSC) migration and differentiation. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newborn astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario is still under debate. We have previously shown that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we use transient brain ischemia in mice to define the cellular origin of these astrocytes in the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing and genetic cellular labelling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the glial scar surrounding the ischemic core. We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the scar by synthesis but also degradation of hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of this polymer at the scar is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These results point to newborn astrocytes as a plausible pharmacological target to modulate the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitate tissue regeneration.\nProtosequences in human cortical organoids model intrinsic states in the developing cortex\nAuthors: Tjitse van der Molen, T.; Spaeth, A.; Chini, M.; Bartram, J.; Dendukuri, A.; Zhang, Z.; Bhaskaran-Nair, K.; Blauvelt, L. J.; Petzold, L. R.; Hansma, P. K.; Teodorescu, M.; Hierlemann, A.; Hengen, K. B.; Hanganu-Opatz, I. L.; Kosik, K. S.; Sharf, T.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573646\nNeuronal firing sequences are thought to be the basic building blocks of neural coding and information broadcasting within the brain. However, when sequences emerge during neurodevelopment remains unknown. We demonstrate that structured firing sequences are present in spontaneous activity of human brain organoids and ex vivo neonatal brain slices from the murine somatosensory cortex. We observed a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent phenomena in human brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis. These findings highlight the potential for brain organoids to further explore how exogenous inputs can be used to refine neuronal circuits and enable new studies into the genetic mechanisms that govern assembly of functional circuitry during early human brain development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Religious fundamentalism, characterized by rigid adherence to a set of beliefs putatively revealing inerrant truths, is ubiquitous across cultures and has a global impact on society. Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobes. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets (r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-induced conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with hemispheric specializations in reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microcircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

        <p class="abstract">Short abstractThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects to the frontal cortex (FC) in both rodents and primates, but the comparative organization of single-neuron BLA-FC projections is unknown. Using a barcoded connectomic approach, we found that BLA neurons are more likely to project to multiple distinct parts of FC in mice than in macaques. Further, while single BLA neuron projections to nucleus accumbens are similarly organized in mice and macaques, BLA-FC connections differ.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely linked to the expression of conditioned behavior. An area of increasing interest is how the dynamics of BLA neurons relate to evolving behavior. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking and employed population-level analyses to assess ongoing neural dynamics. We found that, with training, sustained cue-evoked activity emerged that discriminated between the CS&#43; and CS- and correlated with conditioned responding. This sustained population activity continued until reward receipt and rapidly extinguished along with conditioned behavior during extinction. To assess the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to BLA, to this component of BLA neural activity, we inactivated OFC while recording in BLA and found blunted sustained cue-evoked activity in BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data suggest that sustained cue-driven activity in BLA, which in part depends on OFC input, underlies a conditioned reward-seeking state.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N ~ 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity. Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a &#39;motor&#39; structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) is a crucial network of enteric neurons and glia resident within the entire gastrointestinal tract (GI). Overseeing essential GI functions such as gut motility and water balance, the ENS serves as a pivotal bidirectional link in the gut-brain axis. During early development, the ENS is primarily derived from enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Disruptions to ENCC development, as seen in conditions like Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), lead to absence of ENS in the GI, particularly in the colon. In this study, using zebrafish, we devised an in vivo F0 CRISPR-based screen employing a robust, rapid pipeline integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR reverse genetics, and high-content imaging. Our findings unveil various genes, including those encoding for opioid receptors, as possible regulators of ENS establishment. In addition, we present evidence that suggests opioid receptor involvement in neurochemical coding of the larval ENS. In summary, our work presents a novel, efficient CRISPR screen targeting ENS development, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown genes, and increasing knowledge of nervous system construction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMultiple facets of sleep neurophysiology, including electroencephalography (EEG) metrics such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles and slow oscillations (SO), are altered in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, beyond group-level analyses which treat all patients as a unitary set, the extent to which NREM deficits vary among patients is unclear, as are their relationships to other sources of heterogeneity including clinical factors, illness duration and ageing, cognitive profiles and medication regimens. Using newly collected high density sleep EEG data on 103 individuals with SCZ and 68 controls, we first sought to replicate our previously reported (Kozhemiako et. al, 2022) group-level mean differences between patients and controls (original N=130). Then in the combined sample (N=301 including 175 patients), we characterized patient-to-patient variability in NREM neurophysiology.

ResultsWe replicated all group-level mean differences and confirmed the high accuracy of our predictive model (Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC = 0.93 for diagnosis). Compared to controls, patients showed significantly increased between-individual variability across many (26%) sleep metrics, with patterns only partially recapitulating those for group-level mean differences. Although multiple clinical and cognitive factors were associated with NREM metrics including spindle density, collectively they did not account for much of the general increase in patient-to-patient variability. Medication regimen was a greater (albeit still partial) contributor to variability, although original group mean differences persisted after controlling for medications. Some sleep metrics including fast spindle density showed exaggerated age-related effects in SCZ, and patients exhibited older predicted biological ages based on an independent model of ageing and the sleep EEG.

ConclusionWe demonstrated robust and replicable alterations in sleep neurophysiology in individuals with SCZ and highlighted distinct patterns of effects contrasting between-group means versus within-group variances. We further documented and controlled for a major effect of medication use, and pointed to greater age-related change in NREM sleep in patients. That increased NREM heterogeneity was not explained by standard clinical or cognitive patient assessments suggests the sleep EEG provides novel, nonredundant information to support the goals of personalized medicine. Collectively, our results point to a spectrum of NREM sleep deficits among SCZ patients that can be measured objectively and at scale, and that may offer a unique window on the etiological and genetic diversity that underlies SCZ risk, treatment response and prognosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) after cerebral ischemia is one of the early responses in the brain to counteract the loss of neurons and reduce tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through many chemotactic messages that result in neural stem cells (NSC) migration and differentiation. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newborn astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario is still under debate. We have previously shown that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we use transient brain ischemia in mice to define the cellular origin of these astrocytes in the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing and genetic cellular labelling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the glial scar surrounding the ischemic core. We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the scar by synthesis but also degradation of hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of this polymer at the scar is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These results point to newborn astrocytes as a plausible pharmacological target to modulate the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitate tissue regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuronal firing sequences are thought to be the basic building blocks of neural coding and information broadcasting within the brain. However, when sequences emerge during neurodevelopment remains unknown. We demonstrate that structured firing sequences are present in spontaneous activity of human brain organoids and ex vivo neonatal brain slices from the murine somatosensory cortex. We observed a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent phenomena in human brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis. These findings highlight the potential for brain organoids to further explore how exogenous inputs can be used to refine neuronal circuits and enable new studies into the genetic mechanisms that govern assembly of functional circuitry during early human brain development.</p>
