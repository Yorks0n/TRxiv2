  "articleBody": " Neurological Imprints of Boys' Love Culture: Shaping Sexual Orientation Identity in the Digital Age's Young females\nAuthors: Yanan, C.; Na, A.; Xiaowei, J.; Yingying, C.; Huihui, N.; Shuoyan, H.\nScore: 576.9, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558088\nWith the omnipresence of social media, Boys Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.\nSARS-CoV-2 Spike amyloid fibrils specifically and selectively accelerates amyloid fibril formation of human prion protein and the amyloid β peptide\nAuthors: Larsson, J. N.; Hellstrand, E.; Hammarström, P.; Nyström, S.\nScore: 2168.9, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555834\nAn increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity. Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.\nTSWIFT, a novel method for iterative staining of embedded and mounted human brain sections.\nAuthors: Porter, C. M.; truttmann, m.\nScore: 53.6, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558493\nComprehensive characterization of protein networks in mounted brain tissue represents a major challenge in brain and neurodegenerative disease research. In this study, we develop a simple staining method, called TSWIFT, to iteratively stain pre-mounted formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) brain sections, thus enabling high-dimensional sample phenotyping. We show that TSWIFT conserves tissue architecture and allows for relabeling a single mounted FFPE sample more than 10 times, even after prolonged storage at 4 {degrees}C. Using TSWIFT, we profile the abundance and localization of the HSP70 family chaperones HSC70 (HSPA8) and BiP (HSPA5) in mounted human brain tissue. Our results establish TSWIFT as an efficient method to obtain integrated high-dimensional knowledge of cellular proteomes by analyzing mounted FFPE human brain tissue.\nSerotonin predictively encodes value\nAuthors: Harkin, E. F.; Grossman, C. D.; Cohen, J. Y.; Beïque, J.-C.; Naud, R.\nScore: 47.4, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558526\nThe in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision \u003c\u003c0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.\nA suite of engineered mice for interrogating psychedelic drug actions\nAuthors: Chiu, Y.-t.; Deutch, A.; Wang, W.; Schmitz, G. P.; Huang, K.; Kocak, D.; Lorach, P.; Bowye, K.; Liu, B.; Sciaky, N.; Hua, K.; Chen, C.; Mott, S.; Niehaus, J.; DiBerto, J.; English, J.; Walsh, J.; Scherrer, G.; Herman, M.; Wu, Z.; Wetsel, W. C.; Roth, B. L.\nScore: 42.3, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559347\nPsychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.\nPreconfigured cortico-thalamic neural dynamics constrain movement-associated thalamic activity\nAuthors: Gonzalez-Pereyra, P.; Martinez-Montalvo, M. G.; Ortega-Romero, D. I.; Perez-Diaz, C. I.; Merchant, H.; Tellez, L. A.; Rueda-Orozco, P. E.\nScore: 34.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558667\nNeural preconfigured activity patterns (nPAPs) have been proposed as basic building blocks for cognitive and sensory processing. However, their existence and function in motor networks have not been explicitly studied. Here, we explore the possibility that nPAPs are present in the motor thalamus (VL/VM) and their potential contribution to motor-related activity. To this end, we developed a preparation where VL/VM multiunitary activity could be robustly recorded in mouse behavior evoked by primary motor cortex (M1) optogenetic stimulation and forelimb movements. VL/VM-evoked activity was organized as rigid stereotypical activity patterns at the single and population levels. These activity patterns were unable to dynamically adapt to different temporal architectures of M1 stimulation. Moreover, they were experience- independent and present in virtually all animals, confirming their preconfigured nature. Finally, subpopulations expressing specific M1-evoked patterns also displayed specific movement- related patterns. Our data demonstrate that the behaviorally related identity of specific neural subpopulations is tightly linked to nPAPs.\nSensory experience steers representational drift in mouse visual cortex\nAuthors: Bauer, J.; Lewin, U.; Herbert, E.; Gjorgjieva, J.; Schoonover, C. E.; Fink, A. J. P.; Rose, T.; Bonhoeffer, T.; Hübener, M.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558966\nRepresentational drift - the gradual continuous change of neuronal representations - has been observed across many brain areas. It is unclear whether this drift is caused by synaptic plasticity elicited by sensory experience, or by the intrinsic volatility of synapses. Here, using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex, we find that the preferred stimulus orientation of individual neurons slowly drifts over the course of weeks. By using cylinder lens goggles to limit visual experience to a narrow range of orientations, we show that the direction of drift, but not its magnitude, is biased by the statistics of visual input. A network model suggests that drift of preferred orientation largely results from synaptic volatility, which under normal visual conditions is counteracted by experience-driven Hebbian mechanisms, stabilizing preferred orientation. Under deprivation conditions these Hebbian mechanisms enable adaptation. Thus, Hebbian synaptic plasticity steers drift to match the statistics of the environment.\nWhere the present gets remembered: Sensory regions communicate with the brain over the longest timescales.\nAuthors: Cooper, G. J.; Blackburne, G.; Dekker, T. M.; Das, R. K.; Skipper, J. I.\nScore: 32.2, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558347\nIn natural contexts, the brain simultaneously processes sensory information over diverse timescales. Here we reveal how this is reflected in the organisation of asynchronous connectivity in the brain. In 86 individuals watching feature-length movies during functional neuroimaging, we calculated the delay at peak connectivity between brain regions. We found the longest delays in received whole-brain functional connectivity within sensory regions (:S 18 seconds). Two complementary dimensionality reduction approaches were used to probe the spatial organisation of connection delays and weights. First, clustering of received delays separated sensory, and transmodal/associative outputting regions, suggesting that putatively localised functions are associated with asynchronous local-to-whole-brain connectivity patterns. Next, we organised delayed connectivity maps by likeness, unveiling five orthogonal gradients of variation, each demonstrating associations between early-sensory and transmodal/associative regions. Together, these findings challenge contemporary conceptualisations of the brains temporal hierarchy by emphasising the role of sensory regions as sites of integration across timescales.\nDevelopmentally distinct architectures in top-down circuits\nAuthors: Klune, C. B.; Goodpaster, C. M.; Gongwer, M. W.; Gabriel, C. J.; Chen, R.; Jones, N. S.; Schwarz, L. A.; DeNardo, L. A.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.555010\nThe medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in learning, mood and decision making, including in how individuals respond to threats1-6. mPFC undergoes a uniquely protracted development, with changes in synapse density, cortical thickness, long-range connectivity, and neuronal encoding properties continuing into early adulthood7-21. Models suggest that before adulthood, the slow-developing mPFC cannot adequately regulate activity in faster-developing subcortical centers22,23. They propose that during development, the enhanced influence of subcortical systems underlies distinctive behavioural strategies of juveniles and adolescents and that increasing mPFC control over subcortical structures eventually allows adult behaviours to emerge. Yet it has remained unclear how a progressive strengthening of top-down control can lead to nonlinear changes in behaviour as individuals mature24,25. To address this discrepancy, here we monitored and manipulated activity in the developing brain as animals responded to threats, establishing direct causal links between frontolimbic circuit activity and the behavioural strategies of juvenile, adolescent and adult mice. Rather than a linear strengthening of mPFC synaptic connectivity progressively regulating behaviour, we uncovered multiple developmental switches in the behavioural roles of mPFC circuits targeting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We show these changes are accompanied by axonal pruning coinciding with functional strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the mPFC-BLA and mPFC-NAc pathways, which mature at different rates. Our results reveal how developing mPFC circuits pass through distinct architectures that may make them optimally adapted to the demands of age-specific challenges.\nEngram cell connectivity as a mechanism for information storage and memory function\nAuthors: Ortega-de San Luis, C.; Pezzoli, M.; Urrieta, E.; Ryan, T. J.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558774\nInformation derived from experiences is incorporated into the brain as changes to ensembles of cells, termed engram cells, that allow memory storage and recall. The mechanism by which those changes hold specific information is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that the specific synaptic wiring between engram cells is the substrate of information storage. First, we monitor how learning modifies the connectivity pattern between engram cells at a monosynaptic connection involving the hippocampal vCA1 region and the amygdala. Then, we assess the functional significance of these connectivity changes by artificially activating or inhibiting its presynaptic and postsynaptic components respectively. Finally, we identify a synaptic plasticity mechanism mediated by PSD-95, which impacts the connectivity pattern among engram cells and contributes to the long-term stability of the memory. These findings impact our theory of learning and memory by helping us explain the translation of specific information into engram cells and how these connections shape brain function.\n",

        <p class="abstract">With the omnipresence of social media, Boys Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection.

We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity.

Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Comprehensive characterization of protein networks in mounted brain tissue represents a major challenge in brain and neurodegenerative disease research. In this study, we develop a simple staining method, called TSWIFT, to iteratively stain pre-mounted formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) brain sections, thus enabling high-dimensional sample phenotyping. We show that TSWIFT conserves tissue architecture and allows for relabeling a single mounted FFPE sample more than 10 times, even after prolonged storage at 4 {degrees}C. Using TSWIFT, we profile the abundance and localization of the HSP70 family chaperones HSC70 (HSPA8) and BiP (HSPA5) in mounted human brain tissue. Our results establish TSWIFT as an efficient method to obtain integrated high-dimensional knowledge of cellular proteomes by analyzing mounted FFPE human brain tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision &lt;&lt;0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural preconfigured activity patterns (nPAPs) have been proposed as basic building blocks for cognitive and sensory processing. However, their existence and function in motor networks have not been explicitly studied. Here, we explore the possibility that nPAPs are present in the motor thalamus (VL/VM) and their potential contribution to motor-related activity. To this end, we developed a preparation where VL/VM multiunitary activity could be robustly recorded in mouse behavior evoked by primary motor cortex (M1) optogenetic stimulation and forelimb movements. VL/VM-evoked activity was organized as rigid stereotypical activity patterns at the single and population levels. These activity patterns were unable to dynamically adapt to different temporal architectures of M1 stimulation. Moreover, they were experience- independent and present in virtually all animals, confirming their preconfigured nature. Finally, subpopulations expressing specific M1-evoked patterns also displayed specific movement- related patterns. Our data demonstrate that the behaviorally related identity of specific neural subpopulations is tightly linked to nPAPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Representational drift - the gradual continuous change of neuronal representations - has been observed across many brain areas. It is unclear whether this drift is caused by synaptic plasticity elicited by sensory experience, or by the intrinsic volatility of synapses. Here, using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex, we find that the preferred stimulus orientation of individual neurons slowly drifts over the course of weeks. By using cylinder lens goggles to limit visual experience to a narrow range of orientations, we show that the direction of drift, but not its magnitude, is biased by the statistics of visual input. A network model suggests that drift of preferred orientation largely results from synaptic volatility, which under normal visual conditions is counteracted by experience-driven Hebbian mechanisms, stabilizing preferred orientation. Under deprivation conditions these Hebbian mechanisms enable adaptation. Thus, Hebbian synaptic plasticity steers drift to match the statistics of the environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In natural contexts, the brain simultaneously processes sensory information over diverse timescales. Here we reveal how this is reflected in the organisation of asynchronous connectivity in the brain. In 86 individuals watching feature-length movies during functional neuroimaging, we calculated the delay at peak connectivity between brain regions. We found the longest delays in received whole-brain functional connectivity within  sensory regions (:S 18 seconds). Two complementary dimensionality reduction approaches were used to probe the spatial organisation of connection delays and weights. First, clustering of received delays separated sensory, and transmodal/associative outputting regions, suggesting that putatively localised functions are associated with asynchronous local-to-whole-brain connectivity patterns. Next, we organised delayed connectivity maps by likeness, unveiling five orthogonal gradients of variation, each demonstrating associations between early-sensory and transmodal/associative regions. Together, these findings challenge contemporary conceptualisations of the brains temporal hierarchy by emphasising the role of sensory regions as sites of integration across timescales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in learning, mood and decision making, including in how individuals respond to threats1-6. mPFC undergoes a uniquely protracted development, with changes in synapse density, cortical thickness, long-range connectivity, and neuronal encoding properties continuing into early adulthood7-21. Models suggest that before adulthood, the slow-developing mPFC cannot adequately regulate activity in faster-developing subcortical centers22,23. They propose that during development, the enhanced influence of subcortical systems underlies distinctive behavioural strategies of juveniles and adolescents and that increasing mPFC control over subcortical structures eventually allows adult behaviours to emerge. Yet it has remained unclear how a progressive strengthening of top-down control can lead to nonlinear changes in behaviour as individuals mature24,25. To address this discrepancy, here we monitored and manipulated activity in the developing brain as animals responded to threats, establishing direct causal links between frontolimbic circuit activity and the behavioural strategies of juvenile, adolescent and adult mice. Rather than a linear strengthening of mPFC synaptic connectivity progressively regulating behaviour, we uncovered multiple developmental switches in the behavioural roles of mPFC circuits targeting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We show these changes are accompanied by axonal pruning coinciding with functional strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the mPFC-BLA and mPFC-NAc pathways, which mature at different rates. Our results reveal how developing mPFC circuits pass through distinct architectures that may make them optimally adapted to the demands of age-specific challenges.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Information derived from experiences is incorporated into the brain as changes to ensembles of cells, termed engram cells, that allow memory storage and recall. The mechanism by which those changes hold specific information is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that the specific synaptic wiring between engram cells is the substrate of information storage. First, we monitor how learning modifies the connectivity pattern between engram cells at a monosynaptic connection involving the hippocampal vCA1 region and the amygdala. Then, we assess the functional significance of these connectivity changes by artificially activating or inhibiting its presynaptic and postsynaptic components respectively. Finally, we identify a synaptic plasticity mechanism mediated by PSD-95, which impacts the connectivity pattern among engram cells and contributes to the long-term stability of the memory. These findings impact our theory of learning and memory by helping us explain the translation of specific information into engram cells and how these connections shape brain function.</p>
