E.\nScore: 59.3, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.568932\nSummary ParagraphAstrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2+) signaling1-8. Astrocyte Ca2+ activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity3,4 to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks9-11. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes5,8,12. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2+ responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2+ activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales13-15. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2+ activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.\nConnectivity underlying motor cortex activity during naturalistic goal-directed behavior\nAuthors: Finkelstein, A.; Daie, K.; Rozsa, M.; Darshan, R.; Svoboda, K.\nScore: 48.7, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568673\nNeural representations of information are shaped by local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity focused on stimulus selectivity in the sensory cortex. Here we study neural activity in the motor cortex during naturalistic behavior in which mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behavior does not require training and thus allowed us to probe neural coding and connectivity in motor cortex before its activity is shaped by learning a specific task. Neurons typically responded during and after reaching movements and exhibited conjunctive tuning to target location and reward outcome. We used an all-optical method for large-scale causal functional connectivity mapping in vivo. Mapping connectivity between \u003e 20,000,000 excitatory neuronal pairs revealed fine-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (\u003c 100 m) like-to-like connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant weakly connected neurons and sparse strongly connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target-location and reward-outcome but strongly influenced neighboring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviors.\nHigher-order connectomics of human brain function reveals local topological signatures of task decoding, individual identification, and behavior\nAuthors: Santoro, A.; Battiston, F.; Lucas, M.; Petri, G.; Amico, E.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569913\nTraditional models of human brain activity often represent it as a network of pairwise interactions between brain regions. Going beyond this limitation, recent approaches have been proposed to infer higher-order interactions from temporal brain signals involving three or more regions. However, to this day it remains unclear whether methods based on inferred higher-order interactions outperform traditional pairwise ones for the analysis of fMRI data. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using fMRI time series of 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We show that higher-order approaches greatly enhance our ability to decode dynamically between various tasks, to improve the individual identification of unimodal and transmodal functional subsystems, and to strengthen significantly the associations between brain activity and behavior. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of fMRI time series, improving the characterization of dynamic group dependencies in rest and tasks, and revealing a vast space of unexplored structures within human functional brain data, which may remain hidden when using traditional pairwise approaches.\nState-dependent circuit dynamics of superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells in macaques\nAuthors: Abbaspoor, S.; Hoffman, K. L.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570369\nDiverse neuron classes in hippocampal CA1 have been identified through their heterogeneity in cellular/molecular composition. How these classes relate to the hippocampal function and network dynamics that support cognition in primates remains unclear. Here we report functional cell groups in CA1 of freely-behaving macaques that show a range of spectral phase preferences and varied responses to local network states like the sharp-wave ripple. Segregating superficial-from deep-layer pyramidal cells uncovered differences in firing rate, burstiness, and sharp-wave ripple associated firing. They also showed strata-specific interactions with the inhibitory cell groups. CA1 ensemble recordings revealed the first observations of cell assemblies in the macaque hippocampus, and show that the stratification of pyramidal cells in primates is a major organizing principle of assemblies. These results suggest a sublayer-specific circuit organization in hippocampal CA1 of the freely-behaving macaque that may support dissociable contributions across cognitive and behavioral processes in the primate.\nSpatially resolved molecular and cellular atlas of the mouse brain\nAuthors: Han, L.; Liu, Z.; Jing, Z.; Liu, Y.; Chang, H.; Lei, J.; Peng, Y.; Wang, K.; Xu, Y.; Liu, W.; Wu, Z.; Li, Q.; Shi, X.; Zheng, M.; Wang, H.; Deng, J.; Zhong, Y.; Pan, H.; Lin, J.; Zhang, R.; Chen, Y.; Wu, J.; Xu, M.; Ren, B.; Cheng, M.; Yu, Q.; Song, X.; Lu, Y.; Tang, Y.; Yuan, N.; Sun, S.; An, Y.; Ding, W.; Sun, X.; Wei, Y.; Zhang, S.; Dou, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Han, L.; Zhu, Q.; Xu, J.; Wang, S.; Chen, H.; Wang, D.; Bai, Y.; Liang, Y.; Liu, Y.; Chen, M.; Xie, C.; Bo, B.; Li, M.; Zhang, X.; Ting, W.; Chen, Z.; Fang, J.; Li, S.; Jiang, Y.; Tan, X.; Zuo, G.; Xie, Y.; Li, H.; Tao, Q.; Li, Y.; Liu, J.; Li\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569501\nA comprehensive atlas of genes, cell types, and their spatial distribution across a whole mammalian brain is fundamental for understanding function of the brain. Here, using snRNA-seq and Stereo-seq techniques, we generated a mouse brain atlas with spatial information for 308 cell clusters with single-cell resolution involving over 6 million cells as well as for 29,655 genes. We have identified new astrocyte clusters, and demonstrated that distinct cell clusters exhibit preference for cortical subregions. In addition, we identified 155 genes exhibiting regional specificity in the brainstem, and 513 long non-coding RNA exhibited regional specificity in the adult brain. Parcellation of brain regions based on spatial transcriptomic information showed large overlap with that by traditional method. Furthermore, we have uncovered 411 transcription factor regulons with spatiotemporal specificity during development. Thus, our study has discovered genes and regulon with spatiotemporal specificity, and provided a high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain.\nAdaptive stretching of representations across brain regions and deep learning model layers\nAuthors: Zhang, X.-Y.; Bobadilla-Suarez, S.; Luo, X.; Lemonari, M.; Brincat, S. L.; Siegel, M.; Miller, E. K.; Love, B. C.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569615\nPrefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to modulate the visual system to favor goal-relevant information by accentuating task-relevant stimulus dimensions. Does the brain broadly re-configures itself to optimize performance by stretching visual representations along task-relevant dimensions? We considered a task that required monkeys to selectively attend on a trial-by-trial basis to one of two dimensions (color or motion direction) to make a decision. Except for V4 (color bound) and MT (motion bound), the brain radically re-configured itself to stretch representations along task-relevant dimensions in lateral PFC, frontal eye fields (FEF), lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), and inferotemporal cortex (IT). Spike timing was crucial to this code. A deep learning model was trained on the same visual input and rewards as the monkeys. Despite lacking an explicit selective attention or other control mechanism, the model displayed task-relevant stretching as a consequence of error minimization, indicating that stretching is an adaptive strategy.\nCapillary regression leads to sustained local hypoperfusion by inducing constriction of upstream transitional vessels\nAuthors: Bonney, S. K.; Nielson, C. D.; Sosa, M. J.; Shih, A. Y.\nScore: 43.7, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.564529\nIn the brain, a microvascular sensory web coordinates oxygen delivery to regions of neuronal activity. This involves a dense network of capillaries that send conductive signals upstream to feeding arterioles to promote vasodilation and blood flow. Although this process is critical to the metabolic supply of healthy brain tissue, it may also be a point of vulnerability in disease. Deterioration of capillary networks is a hallmark of many neurological disorders and how this web is engaged during vascular damage remains unknown. We performed in vivo two-photon microscopy on young adult mural cell reporter mice and induced focal capillary injuries using precise two-photon laser irradiation of single capillaries. We found that [~]63% of the injuries resulted in regression of the capillary segment 7-14 days following injury, and the remaining repaired to re-establish blood flow within 7 days. Injuries that resulted in capillary regression induced sustained vasoconstriction in the upstream arteriole-capillary transition (ACT) zone at least 21 days post-injury in both awake and anesthetized mice. This abnormal vasoconstriction involved attenuation of vasomotor dynamics and uncoupling from mural cell calcium signaling following capillary regression. Consequently, blood flow was reduced in the ACT zone and in secondary, uninjured downstream capillaries. These findings demonstrate how capillary injury and regression, as often seen in age-related neurological disease, can impair the microvascular sensory web and contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion. SIGNIFICANCEDeterioration of the capillary network is a characteristic of many neurological diseases and can exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration due to poor blood perfusion. Here we show that focal capillary injuries can induce vessel regression and elicit sustained vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels that branch from cortical penetrating arterioles. This reduces blood flow to broader, uninjured regions of the same microvascular network. These findings suggest that widespread and cumulative damage to brain capillaries in neurological disease may broadly affect blood supply and contribute to hypoperfusion through their remote actions.\nContentopic mapping in ventral and dorsal association cortex: the topographical organization of manipulable object information\nAuthors: Almeida, J.; Kristensen, S.; Tal, Z.; Fracasso, A.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.568856\nUnderstanding how object information is neurally organized is fundamental to unravel object recognition1-4. The best-known neural organizational principle of information is topographical mapping of specific dimensions. Such maps have been shown mainly for sensorimotor information within sensorimotor cortices (e.g., retinotopy)5-9. Thus, here we ask whether there are topographic maps - by analogy, contentopic maps - for mid-level object-related dimensions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and population receptive field analysis7 to measure tuning of neural populations to selected manipulable object-related dimensions. Here we show maps in dorsal and ventral occipital cortex that code for the score of each object on each target dimension in a linear progression following a particular direction along the cortical surface. Maps for each dimension are distinct, and consistent across individuals. Thus, object information is coded in multiple topographical maps - i.e., contentopic maps. These contentopic maps refer to intermediate level visual and visuomotor representations, and are potentially computed from the grouping of lower-level information through non-linear transformation following gestalt principles4,10. This shows that topography is a widespread and non-incidental strategy for the organization of information in the brain that leads to greatly reduced connectivity-related metabolic costs and fast and efficient readouts of information for stimuli discrimination11,12.\nPIEZO2-dependent rapid pain system in humans and mice.\nAuthors: Bouchatta, O.; Brodzki, M.; Manouze, H.; Carballo, G.

Here, we discovered an exception - a form of mechanical pain evoked by hair pulling. Based on observations in a rare group of individuals with PIEZO2 deficiency syndrome, we demonstrated that hair-pull pain is dependent on PIEZO2 transduction. Studies in control participants showed that hair-pull pain triggered a distinct nocifensive response, including a nociceptive reflex. Observations in rare A{beta} deafferented individuals and nerve conduction block studies in control participants revealed that hair-pull pain perception is dependent on A{beta} input. Single-unit axonal recordings revealed that a class of cooling-responsive myelinated nociceptors in human skin is selectively tuned to painful hair-pull stimuli. Further, we pharmacologically mapped these nociceptors to a specific transcriptomic class. Finally, using functional imaging in mice, we demonstrated that in a homologous nociceptor, Piezo2 is necessary for high-sensitivity, robust activation by hair-pull stimuli. Together, we have demonstrated that hair-pulling evokes a distinct type of pain with conserved behavioral, neural, and molecular features across humans and mice.\nGeometric experience sculpts the development and dynamics of hippocampal sequential cell assemblies\nAuthors: Farooq, U.; Dragoi, G.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.570026\nEuclidean space is the fabric of the world we live in. Whether and how geometric experience shapes our spatial-temporal representations of the world remained unknown. We deprived rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside translucent spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired neuronal pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear track experiences, partly driven by reduced preconfigured network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects, substantiating the role of geometric experience on hippocampal neural development. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Summary ParagraphAstrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2&#43;) signaling1-8. Astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity3,4 to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks9-11. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes5,8,12. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2&#43; imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2&#43; responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2&#43; activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales13-15. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural representations of information are shaped by local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity focused on stimulus selectivity in the sensory cortex. Here we study neural activity in the motor cortex during naturalistic behavior in which mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behavior does not require training and thus allowed us to probe neural coding and connectivity in motor cortex before its activity is shaped by learning a specific task. Neurons typically responded during and after reaching movements and exhibited conjunctive tuning to target location and reward outcome. We used an all-optical method for large-scale causal functional connectivity mapping in vivo. Mapping connectivity between &gt; 20,000,000 excitatory neuronal pairs revealed fine-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (&lt; 100 m) like-to-like connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant weakly connected neurons and sparse strongly connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target-location and reward-outcome but strongly influenced neighboring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traditional models of human brain activity often represent it as a network of pairwise interactions between brain regions. Going beyond this limitation, recent approaches have been proposed to infer higher-order interactions from temporal brain signals involving three or more regions. However, to this day it remains unclear whether methods based on inferred higher-order interactions outperform traditional pairwise ones for the analysis of fMRI data. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using fMRI time series of 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We show that higher-order approaches greatly enhance our ability to decode dynamically between various tasks, to improve the individual identification of unimodal and transmodal functional subsystems, and to strengthen significantly the associations between brain activity and behavior. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of fMRI time series, improving the characterization of dynamic group dependencies in rest and tasks, and revealing a vast space of unexplored structures within human functional brain data, which may remain hidden when using traditional pairwise approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse neuron classes in hippocampal CA1 have been identified through their heterogeneity in cellular/molecular composition. How these classes relate to the hippocampal function and network dynamics that support cognition in primates remains unclear. Here we report functional cell groups in CA1 of freely-behaving macaques that show a range of spectral phase preferences and varied responses to local network states like the sharp-wave ripple. Segregating superficial-from deep-layer pyramidal cells uncovered differences in firing rate, burstiness, and sharp-wave ripple associated firing. They also showed strata-specific interactions with the inhibitory cell groups. CA1 ensemble recordings revealed the first observations of cell assemblies in the macaque hippocampus, and show that the stratification of pyramidal cells in primates is a major organizing principle of assemblies. These results suggest a sublayer-specific circuit organization in hippocampal CA1 of the freely-behaving macaque that may support dissociable contributions across cognitive and behavioral processes in the primate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A comprehensive atlas of genes, cell types, and their spatial distribution across a whole mammalian brain is fundamental for understanding function of the brain. Here, using snRNA-seq and Stereo-seq techniques, we generated a mouse brain atlas with spatial information for 308 cell clusters with single-cell resolution involving over 6 million cells as well as for 29,655 genes. We have identified new astrocyte clusters, and demonstrated that distinct cell clusters exhibit preference for cortical subregions. In addition, we identified 155 genes exhibiting regional specificity in the brainstem, and 513 long non-coding RNA exhibited regional specificity in the adult brain. Parcellation of brain regions based on spatial transcriptomic information showed large overlap with that by traditional method. Furthermore, we have uncovered 411 transcription factor regulons with spatiotemporal specificity during development. Thus, our study has discovered genes and regulon with spatiotemporal specificity, and provided a high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to modulate the visual system to favor goal-relevant information by accentuating task-relevant stimulus dimensions. Does the brain broadly re-configures itself to optimize performance by stretching visual representations along task-relevant dimensions? We considered a task that required monkeys to selectively attend on a trial-by-trial basis to one of two dimensions (color or motion direction) to make a decision. Except for V4 (color bound) and MT (motion bound), the brain radically re-configured itself to stretch representations along task-relevant dimensions in lateral PFC, frontal eye fields (FEF), lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), and inferotemporal cortex (IT). Spike timing was crucial to this code. A deep learning model was trained on the same visual input and rewards as the monkeys. Despite lacking an explicit selective attention or other control mechanism, the model displayed task-relevant stretching as a consequence of error minimization, indicating that stretching is an adaptive strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the brain, a microvascular sensory web coordinates oxygen delivery to regions of neuronal activity. This involves a dense network of capillaries that send conductive signals upstream to feeding arterioles to promote vasodilation and blood flow. Although this process is critical to the metabolic supply of healthy brain tissue, it may also be a point of vulnerability in disease. Deterioration of capillary networks is a hallmark of many neurological disorders and how this web is engaged during vascular damage remains unknown. We performed in vivo two-photon microscopy on young adult mural cell reporter mice and induced focal capillary injuries using precise two-photon laser irradiation of single capillaries. We found that [~]63% of the injuries resulted in regression of the capillary segment 7-14 days following injury, and the remaining repaired to re-establish blood flow within 7 days. Injuries that resulted in capillary regression induced sustained vasoconstriction in the upstream arteriole-capillary transition (ACT) zone at least 21 days post-injury in both awake and anesthetized mice. This abnormal vasoconstriction involved attenuation of vasomotor dynamics and uncoupling from mural cell calcium signaling following capillary regression. Consequently, blood flow was reduced in the ACT zone and in secondary, uninjured downstream capillaries. These findings demonstrate how capillary injury and regression, as often seen in age-related neurological disease, can impair the microvascular sensory web and contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion.

SIGNIFICANCEDeterioration of the capillary network is a characteristic of many neurological diseases and can exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration due to poor blood perfusion. Here we show that focal capillary injuries can induce vessel regression and elicit sustained vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels that branch from cortical penetrating arterioles. This reduces blood flow to broader, uninjured regions of the same microvascular network. These findings suggest that widespread and cumulative damage to brain capillaries in neurological disease may broadly affect blood supply and contribute to hypoperfusion through their remote actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how object information is neurally organized is fundamental to unravel object recognition1-4. The best-known neural organizational principle of information is topographical mapping of specific dimensions. Such maps have been shown mainly for sensorimotor information within sensorimotor cortices (e.g., retinotopy)5-9. Thus, here we ask whether there are topographic maps - by analogy, contentopic maps - for mid-level object-related dimensions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and population receptive field analysis7 to measure tuning of neural populations to selected manipulable object-related dimensions. Here we show maps in dorsal and ventral occipital cortex that code for the score of each object on each target dimension in a linear progression following a particular direction along the cortical surface. Maps for each dimension are distinct, and consistent across individuals. Thus, object information is coded in multiple topographical maps - i.e., contentopic maps. These contentopic maps refer to intermediate level visual and visuomotor representations, and are potentially computed from the grouping of lower-level information through non-linear transformation following gestalt principles4,10. This shows that topography is a widespread and non-incidental strategy for the organization of information in the brain that leads to greatly reduced connectivity-related metabolic costs and fast and efficient readouts of information for stimuli discrimination11,12.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The PIEZO2 ion channel is critical for transducing light touch into neural signals but is not considered necessary for transducing acute pain in humans. Here, we discovered an exception - a form of mechanical pain evoked by hair pulling. Based on observations in a rare group of individuals with PIEZO2 deficiency syndrome, we demonstrated that hair-pull pain is dependent on PIEZO2 transduction. Studies in control participants showed that hair-pull pain triggered a distinct nocifensive response, including a nociceptive reflex. Observations in rare A{beta} deafferented individuals and nerve conduction block studies in control participants revealed that hair-pull pain perception is dependent on A{beta} input. Single-unit axonal recordings revealed that a class of cooling-responsive myelinated nociceptors in human skin is selectively tuned to painful hair-pull stimuli. Further, we pharmacologically mapped these nociceptors to a specific transcriptomic class. Finally, using functional imaging in mice, we demonstrated that in a homologous nociceptor, Piezo2 is necessary for high-sensitivity, robust activation by hair-pull stimuli. Together, we have demonstrated that hair-pulling evokes a distinct type of pain with conserved behavioral, neural, and molecular features across humans and mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Euclidean space is the fabric of the world we live in. Whether and how geometric experience shapes our spatial-temporal representations of the world remained unknown. We deprived rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside translucent spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired neuronal pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear track experiences, partly driven by reduced preconfigured network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects, substantiating the role of geometric experience on hippocampal neural development. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.</p>
