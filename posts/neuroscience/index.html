However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that areas role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neurons visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouses visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given areas collection of preferred stimuli ( own-stimuli) drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas ( other-stimuli). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.\nAn output-null signature of inertial load in motor cortex\nAuthors: Kirk, E. A.; Hope, K. T.; Sober, S. J.; Sauerbrei, B. A.\nScore: 42.1, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565869\nCoordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.\nAberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves following synapsin-dependent adenoviral expression of Ca2+ indicators\nAuthors: Masala, N.; Mittag, M.; Ambrad Giovannetti, E.; O'Neil, D. A.; Distler, F. J.; Rupprecht, P.; Helmchen, F.; Yuste, R.; Fuhrmann, M.; Beck, H.; Wenzel, M.; Kelly, T.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566169\nGenetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adenoviral transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2+ micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer. Ca2+ micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI under the synapsin promoter. Further, neuronal subtype, and density of GECI expression may play a role. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used syn-Ca2+-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca2+ responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca2+ micro-waves and we provide a potential solution for this problem.\nStriatum supports fast learning but not memory recall\nAuthors: Reinhold, K.; Iadarola, M.; Tang, S.; Kuwamoto, W.; Sun, S.; Hakim, R.; Zimmer, J.; Wang, W.; Sabatini, B. L.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566333\nAnimals learn to carry out motor actions in specific sensory contexts to achieve goals. The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory-motor associations, yet its contribution to memory formation or recall is not clear. To investigate the contribution of striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with forelimb reaches to access food pellets. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short- (within an hour) or long-term (across days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in task performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.\nDivergent Recruitment of Developmentally-Defined Neuronal Ensembles Supports Memory Dynamics\nAuthors: Kveim, V. A.; Salm, L.; Ulmer, T.; Kandler, S.; Imhof, F.; Donato, F.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565779\nMemories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence a memory properties evolution over time. By leveraging a developmental approach to target distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we show that memory encoding results in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces are instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and follow distinct reactivation trajectories post-encoding. Notably, the divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpins memory ensembles gradual reorganization, and modulates memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and memories progression over time.\nCell lineage analysis with somatic mutations reveals late divergence of neuronal cell types and cortical areas in human cerebral cortex\nAuthors: Kim, S. N.; Viswanadham, V. V.; Doan, R. N.; Dou, Y.; Bizzotto, S.; Khoshkoo, S.; Huang, A. Y.; Yeh, R.; Chhouk, B.; Truong, A.; Chappell, K. M.; Beaudin, M.; Barton, A. R.; Akula, S. K.; Rento, L.; Lodato, M.; Ganz, J.; Szeto, R. A.; Li, P.; Tsai, J. W.; Hill, R. S.; Park, P. J.; Walsh, C. A.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565899\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex shows functional specialization into regions with distinct neuronal compositions, most strikingly in the human brain, but little is known in about how cellular lineages shape cortical regional variation and neuronal cell types during development. Here, we use somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) to map lineages of neuronal sub-types and cortical regions. Early-occurring sSNVs rarely respect Brodmann area (BA) borders, while late-occurring sSNVs mark neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction, though descendants often dispersed into neighboring BAs. Nevertheless, in visual cortex, BA17 contains 30-70% more sSNVs compared to the neighboring BA18, with clones across the BA17/18 border distributed asymmetrically and thus displaying different cortex-wide dispersion patterns. Moreover, we find that excitatory neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction consistently share low-mosaic sSNVs with some inhibitory neurons, suggesting significant co-generation of excitatory and some inhibitory neurons in the dorsal cortex. Our analysis reveals human-specific cortical cell lineage patterns, with both regional inhomogeneities in progenitor proliferation and late divergence of excitatory/inhibitory lineages.\nGlutamate inputs send prediction error of reward but not negative value of aversive stimuli to dopamine neurons\nAuthors: Amo, R.; Uchida, N.; Watabe-Uchida, M.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566472\nMidbrain dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction errors (RPEs) but the mechanisms underlying RPE computation, particularly contributions of different neurotransmitters, remain poorly understood. Here we used a genetically-encoded glutamate sensor to examine the pattern of glutamate inputs to dopamine neurons. We found that glutamate inputs exhibit virtually all of the characteristics of RPE, rather than conveying a specific component of RPE computation such as reward or expectation. Notably, while glutamate inputs were transiently inhibited by reward omission, they were excited by aversive stimuli. Opioid analgesics altered dopamine negative responses to aversive stimuli toward more positive responses, while excitatory responses of glutamate inputs remained unchanged. Our findings uncover previously unknown synaptic mechanisms underlying RPE computations; dopamine responses are shaped by both synergistic and competitive interactions between glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons depending on valences, with competitive interactions playing a role in responses to aversive stimuli.\nVectorized instructive signals in cortical dendrites during a brain-computerinterface task\nAuthors: Francioni, V.; Tang, V. D.; Brown, N. J.; Toloza, E. H. S.; Harnett, M.\nScore: 23.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565534\nBackpropagation of error is the most widely used learning algorithm in artificial neural networks, forming the backbone of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence1,2. Backpropagation provides a solution to the credit assignment problem by vectorizing an error signal tailored to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement backpropagation-like learning by semi-independently processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments3-7. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. We designed a neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) task with an experimenter-defined reward function to evaluate the key requirements for dendrites to implement backpropagation-like learning. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (4 or 5 neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic versus dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals both depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. These results provide the first biological evidence of a backpropagation-like solution to the credit assignment problem in the brain.\nGeneral anaesthesia reduces the uniqueness of brain connectivity across individuals and across species\nAuthors: Luppi, A. I.; Golkowski, D.; Ranft, A.; Ilg, R.; Jordan, D.; Bzdok, D.; Owen, A. M. I.; Naci, L.; Stamatakis, E. A.; Amico, E. A.; Misic, B.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566332\nThe human brain is characterised by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain: both with respect to the brains of other individuals, and the brains of another species. We report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organised: it co-localises with the archetypal sensory-association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol, and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that under anaesthesia the functional connectivity of the human brain becomes more similar to the macaque brain. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and meta-analytic brain patterns aggregated from the NeuroSynth engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetised human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.\nEnvironmental enrichment and physical exercise prevent stress-induced behavioral and blood-brain barrier alterations via Fgf2\nAuthors: Paton, S. E.; Solano, J. L.; Collignon, A.; Richer, E.; Coulombe-Rozon, F.; Dion-Albert, L.; Binder, L. B.; Dudek, K. A.; Cadoret, A.; Signature Consortium, ; Lebel, M.; Menard, C.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566229\nChronic stress can promote loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity leading to passage of circulating inflammatory mediators in mood-regulating brain areas and establishment of depressive behaviors. Conversely, neurovascular adaptations favoring resilience to stress exposure remain undetermined. Here, we report that environmental enrichment dampens stress-induced loss of endothelial tight junction protein Claudin-5 (Cldn5) along with anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice via an increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2). Treatment of mouse and human endothelial cells with Fgf2 preceding an immune challenge with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, elevated after chronic stress and in depression, reduces BBB dysfunction, and altered cell signaling. Coping with voluntary physical exercise also protects the BBB from stress deleterious effects by increasing Fgf2 preventing Cldn5 loss, exacerbated inflammation, and social avoidance. Circulating FGF2 level is linked with depression severity and symptomatology in humans supporting involvement of this growth factor in mood disorders and stress-induced BBB changes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding computations in the visual system requires a characterization of the distinct feature preferences of neurons in different visual cortical areas. However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that areas role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neurons visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouses visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given areas collection of preferred stimuli ( own-stimuli) drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas ( other-stimuli). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adenoviral transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2&#43; micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer. Ca2&#43; micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2&#43; micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI under the synapsin promoter. Further, neuronal subtype, and density of GECI expression may play a role. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used syn-Ca2&#43;-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca2&#43; responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca2&#43; micro-waves and we provide a potential solution for this problem.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals learn to carry out motor actions in specific sensory contexts to achieve goals. The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory-motor associations, yet its contribution to memory formation or recall is not clear. To investigate the contribution of striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with forelimb reaches to access food pellets. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short- (within an hour) or long-term (across days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in task performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence a memory properties evolution over time. By leveraging a developmental approach to target distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we show that memory encoding results in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces are instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and follow distinct reactivation trajectories post-encoding. Notably, the divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpins memory ensembles gradual reorganization, and modulates memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and memories progression over time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian cerebral cortex shows functional specialization into regions with distinct neuronal compositions, most strikingly in the human brain, but little is known in about how cellular lineages shape cortical regional variation and neuronal cell types during development. Here, we use somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) to map lineages of neuronal sub-types and cortical regions. Early-occurring sSNVs rarely respect Brodmann area (BA) borders, while late-occurring sSNVs mark neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction, though descendants often dispersed into neighboring BAs. Nevertheless, in visual cortex, BA17 contains 30-70% more sSNVs compared to the neighboring BA18, with clones across the BA17/18 border distributed asymmetrically and thus displaying different cortex-wide dispersion patterns. Moreover, we find that excitatory neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction consistently share low-mosaic sSNVs with some inhibitory neurons, suggesting significant co-generation of excitatory and some inhibitory neurons in the dorsal cortex. Our analysis reveals human-specific cortical cell lineage patterns, with both regional inhomogeneities in progenitor proliferation and late divergence of excitatory/inhibitory lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction errors (RPEs) but the mechanisms underlying RPE computation, particularly contributions of different neurotransmitters, remain poorly understood. Here we used a genetically-encoded glutamate sensor to examine the pattern of glutamate inputs to dopamine neurons. We found that glutamate inputs exhibit virtually all of the characteristics of RPE, rather than conveying a specific component of RPE computation such as reward or expectation. Notably, while glutamate inputs were transiently inhibited by reward omission, they were excited by aversive stimuli. Opioid analgesics altered dopamine negative responses to aversive stimuli toward more positive responses, while excitatory responses of glutamate inputs remained unchanged. Our findings uncover previously unknown synaptic mechanisms underlying RPE computations; dopamine responses are shaped by both synergistic and competitive interactions between glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons depending on valences, with competitive interactions playing a role in responses to aversive stimuli.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Backpropagation of error is the most widely used learning algorithm in artificial neural networks, forming the backbone of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence1,2. Backpropagation provides a solution to the credit assignment problem by vectorizing an error signal tailored to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement backpropagation-like learning by semi-independently processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments3-7. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. We designed a neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) task with an experimenter-defined reward function to evaluate the key requirements for dendrites to implement backpropagation-like learning. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (4 or 5 neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic versus dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals both depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. These results provide the first biological evidence of a backpropagation-like solution to the credit assignment problem in the brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human brain is characterised by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain: both with respect to the brains of other individuals, and the brains of another species. We report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organised: it co-localises with the archetypal sensory-association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol, and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that under anaesthesia the functional connectivity of the human brain becomes more similar to the macaque brain. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and meta-analytic brain patterns aggregated from the NeuroSynth engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetised human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic stress can promote loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity leading to passage of circulating inflammatory mediators in mood-regulating brain areas and establishment of depressive behaviors. Conversely, neurovascular adaptations favoring resilience to stress exposure remain undetermined. Here, we report that environmental enrichment dampens stress-induced loss of endothelial tight junction protein Claudin-5 (Cldn5) along with anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice via an increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2). Treatment of mouse and human endothelial cells with Fgf2 preceding an immune challenge with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, elevated after chronic stress and in depression, reduces BBB dysfunction, and altered cell signaling. Coping with voluntary physical exercise also protects the BBB from stress deleterious effects by increasing Fgf2 preventing Cldn5 loss, exacerbated inflammation, and social avoidance. Circulating FGF2 level is linked with depression severity and symptomatology in humans supporting involvement of this growth factor in mood disorders and stress-induced BBB changes.</p>
