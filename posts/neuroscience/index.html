C.; Roth, B. L.\nScore: 79.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559347\nPsychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.\nNeural circuit mechanisms underlying context-specific halting in Drosophila.\nAuthors: Sapkal, N.; Mancini, N.; Kumar, D. S.; Spiller, N.; Murakami, K.; Vitelli, G.; Bargeron, B.; Maier, K.; Eichler, K.; Jefferis, G. S. X. E.; Shiu, P.; Sterne, G. R.; Bidaye, S. S.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559438\nWalking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical but often overlooked component of walking control. While recent studies have delineated specific genetically defined neuronal populations in the mouse brainstem that drive different types of halting1-3, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking-state neural activity to generate context-appropriate halting, remain unclear. Here, we elucidate two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (\"walk-OFF\" mechanism) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, while the second mechanism (\"brake\" mechanism) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve-cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. Using connectome-informed models4-6 and functional studies, we show that two neuronal types that deploy the \"walk-OFF\" mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward-walking or steering. The \"brake\" neurons on the other hand, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking promoting pathways and increasing the resistance at the leg-joints leading to an arrest of leg movements in the stance phase of walking. We characterized two ethologically relevant behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the \"walk-OFF\" pathway was engaged for halting during feeding, and the \"brake\" pathway was engaged for halting during grooming. Furthermore, this knowledge of the neural targets and mechanisms for halting, allowed us to use connectomics to predict novel halting pathways that could be relevant in other behavioral contexts.\nAdolescent oligodendrogenesis and myelination restrict experience-dependent neuronal plasticity in adult visual cortex\nAuthors: Xin, W.; Kaneko, M.; Roth, R. H.; Zhang, A.; Nocera, S.; Ding, J. B.; Stryker, M. P.; Chan, J. R.\nScore: 27.8, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560231\nBACKGROUND: Developmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age. We tested this hypothesis in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To prevent myelin progression, we conditionally deleted Myrf, a transcription factor necessary for oligodendrocyte maturation, from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Myrf cKO) in adolescent mice. To induce experience-dependent plasticity, adult control and Myrf cKO mice were monocularly deprived by eyelid suture. Functional and structural neuronal plasticity in the visual cortex were assessed in vivo by intrinsic signal optical imaging and longitudinal two photon imaging of dendritic spines, respectively. RESULTS: During adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. Myrf deletion from oligodendrocyte precursors during adolescence led to inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that persisted into adulthood. Following monocular deprivation, visual cortex activity in response to visual stimulation of the deprived eye remained stable in adult control mice, as expected for post-critical period animals. By contrast, visual cortex responses to the deprived eye decreased significantly following monocular deprivation in adult Myrf cKO mice, reminiscent of the plasticity observed in adolescent mice. Furthermore, visual cortex neurons in adult Myrf cKO mice had fewer dendritic spines and a higher level of spine turnover. Finally, monocular deprivation induced spatially coordinated spine size decreases in adult Myrf cKO, but not control, mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of myelin acting as a brake on neuronal plasticity during development.\nPlacebo treatment affects brain systems related to affective and cognitive processes, but not nociceptive pain\nAuthors: Botvinik-Nezer, R.; Petre, B.; Ceko, M.; Lindquist, M. A.; Friedman, N. P.; Wager, T. D.\nScore: 31.7, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558825\nPlacebo analgesia is a replicable and well-studied phenomenon, yet it remains unclear to what degree it includes modulation of nociceptive processes. Some studies find effects consistent with nociceptive effects, but meta-analyses show that these effects are often small. We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain. Our results indicate that processes related to affective and cognitive aspects of pain primarily drive placebo analgesia.\nSARS-CoV-2 neurotropism-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors require Microglia activation\nAuthors: Ge, Q.; Zhou, S.; Porras, J.; Fu, P.; Wang, T.; Du, J.; Li, K.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560570\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a wide range of long COVID neurological symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.\nHierarchical VAEs provide a normative account of motion processing in the primate brain\nAuthors: Vafaii, H.; Yates, J. L.; Butts, D. A.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559646\nThe relationship between perception and inference, as postulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century, is paralleled in modern machine learning by generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their hierarchical variants. Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We introduce a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We found that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth variables and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses with a performance gain of over 2x and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. Finally, these results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Collectively, these results support the notion that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlies the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs offer an effective means of capturing this understanding.\nNeocortico-hippocampal ripple-based coordination during naturalistic encoding\nAuthors: Silva, M.; Wu, X.; Sabio, M.; Conde-Blanco, E.; Roldan, P.; Donaire, A.; Carreno, M.; Axmacher, N.; Baldassano, C.; Fuentemilla, L.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559739\nMemory formation relies on effective communication between the hippocampus and neocortical areas. Ripples have been proposed as a key neural signature facilitating information transmission in the brain. However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored. Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie. Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and in neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex). Our results revealed a coordinated neocortico-hippocampal ripple-based interaction during encoding. However, this interaction exhibited distinct timing patterns: ripples in the temporal cortex preceded those from the hippocampus which then preceded those from frontal cortex. Additionally, enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the role of ripples in event segmentation, suggesting their potential role in forming long-term memories of distinct episodes.\nDistractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments\nAuthors: Gheza, D.; Kool, W.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556248\nGoal-directed behavior requires humans to constantly manage and switch between multiple, independent, and conflicting, sources of information. Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments. To address this question, we developed a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions. We use it to test whether people adapt to prior conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis. Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization. A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units. Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control, and their neurocomputational underpinnings.\nObjects, faces, and spaces: Organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior\nAuthors: Sigurdardottir, H. M.; Olafsdottir, I. M.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560383\nWhat are the diagnostic dimensions on which objects truly differ visually, and do these dimensions provide the foundation for the organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior? Using data-driven methods, we utilized a deep convolutional neural network to construct a visual object space extracted from deep layer activations for a reference set of objects. The first two dimensions of object space capture attributes that distinguish one object from another and may map onto the anatomical organization of the ventral visual stream of non-human primates, but its existence in humans is unclear. If object space underlies human visual cognition, this should have a measurable effect on people's object discrimination. We focused on the so-called face quadrant of object space, as there are considerable individual differences in face discrimination abilities, and a lively debate has revolved around whether such abilities are specific to faces. In this preregistered study, we collected data from a large (N=511) heterogeneous sample to amplify individual differences in visual discrimination. We primarily targeted people with self-declared face recognition abilities on opposite sides of the spectrum, ranging from poor to excellent face recognizers. We then administered a visual foraging task where faces and other objects had to be discriminated. Stimuli were carefully picked out of tens of thousands of images to either match or not match with the coordinates of faces in object space. Results showed that face discrimination did not rely on completely domain-specific abilities but also tapped into mechanisms that supported other object discrimination. Specifically, people who struggled with telling apart faces also had difficulties with discriminating other objects from the face quadrant of object space. To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first behavioral evidence for the existence of an object space in human visual cognition.\nNeurological Imprints of Boys' Love Culture: Shaping Sexual Orientation Identity in the Digital Age's Young females\nAuthors: Yanan, C.; Na, A.; Xiaowei, J.; Yingying, C.; Huihui, N.; Shuoyan, H.\nScore: 574.2, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558088\nWith the omnipresence of social media, Boys Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for many neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine, and cluster headaches. LSD and psilocybin exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (HTR2A). Here we provide a suite of engineered mice useful for clarifying the role of HTR2A and HTR2A-expressing neurons in psychedelic drug actions. We first generated Htr2a-EGFP-CT-IRES-CreERT2 mice (CT:C-terminus) to independently identify both HTR2A-EGFP-CT receptors and HTR2A-containing cells thereby providing a detailed anatomical map of HTR2A and identifying cell types that express HTR2A. We also generated a humanized Htr2a mouse line and an additional constitutive Htr2A-Cre mouse line. Psychedelics induced a variety of known behavioral changes in our mice validating their utility for behavioral studies. Finally, electrophysiology studies revealed that extracellular 5-HT elicited a HTR2A-mediated robust increase in firing of genetically-identified pyramidal neurons--consistent with a plasma membrane localization and mode of action. These mouse lines represent invaluable tools for elucidating the molecular, cellular, pharmacological, physiological, behavioral, and other actions of psychedelic drugs in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Walking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical but often overlooked component of walking control. While recent studies have delineated specific genetically defined neuronal populations in the mouse brainstem that drive different types of halting1-3, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking-state neural activity to generate context-appropriate halting, remain unclear. Here, we elucidate two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (&#34;walk-OFF&#34; mechanism) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, while the second mechanism (&#34;brake&#34; mechanism) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve-cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. Using connectome-informed models4-6 and functional studies, we show that two neuronal types that deploy the &#34;walk-OFF&#34; mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward-walking or steering. The &#34;brake&#34; neurons on the other hand, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking promoting pathways and increasing the resistance at the leg-joints leading to an arrest of leg movements in the stance phase of walking. We characterized two ethologically relevant behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the &#34;walk-OFF&#34; pathway was engaged for halting during feeding, and the &#34;brake&#34; pathway was engaged for halting during grooming. Furthermore, this knowledge of the neural targets and mechanisms for halting, allowed us to use connectomics to predict novel halting pathways that could be relevant in other behavioral contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Developmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age. We tested this hypothesis in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To prevent myelin progression, we conditionally deleted Myrf, a transcription factor necessary for oligodendrocyte maturation, from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Myrf cKO) in adolescent mice. To induce experience-dependent plasticity, adult control and Myrf cKO mice were monocularly deprived by eyelid suture. Functional and structural neuronal plasticity in the visual cortex were assessed in vivo by intrinsic signal optical imaging and longitudinal two photon imaging of dendritic spines, respectively. RESULTS: During adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. Myrf deletion from oligodendrocyte precursors during adolescence led to inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that persisted into adulthood. Following monocular deprivation, visual cortex activity in response to visual stimulation of the deprived eye remained stable in adult control mice, as expected for post-critical period animals. By contrast, visual cortex responses to the deprived eye decreased significantly following monocular deprivation in adult Myrf cKO mice, reminiscent of the plasticity observed in adolescent mice. Furthermore, visual cortex neurons in adult Myrf cKO mice had fewer dendritic spines and a higher level of spine turnover. Finally, monocular deprivation induced spatially coordinated spine size decreases in adult Myrf cKO, but not control, mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of myelin acting as a brake on neuronal plasticity during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Placebo analgesia is a replicable and well-studied phenomenon, yet it remains unclear to what degree it includes modulation of nociceptive processes. Some studies find effects consistent with nociceptive effects, but meta-analyses show that these effects are often small. We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain. Our results indicate that processes related to affective and cognitive aspects of pain primarily drive placebo analgesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a wide range of long COVID neurological symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relationship between perception and inference, as postulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century, is paralleled in modern machine learning by generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their hierarchical variants. Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We introduce a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We found that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth variables and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses with a performance gain of over 2x and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. Finally, these results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Collectively, these results support the notion that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlies the brain&#39;s understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs offer an effective means of capturing this understanding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memory formation relies on effective communication between the hippocampus and neocortical areas. Ripples have been proposed as a key neural signature facilitating information transmission in the brain. However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored. Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie. Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and in neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex). Our results revealed a coordinated neocortico-hippocampal ripple-based interaction during encoding. However, this interaction exhibited distinct timing patterns: ripples in the temporal cortex preceded those from the hippocampus which then preceded those from frontal cortex. Additionally, enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the role of ripples in event segmentation, suggesting their potential role in forming long-term memories of distinct episodes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Goal-directed behavior requires humans to constantly manage and switch between multiple, independent, and conflicting, sources of information. Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments. To address this question, we developed a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions. We use it to test whether people adapt to prior conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis. Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization. A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units. Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control, and their neurocomputational underpinnings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">What are the diagnostic dimensions on which objects truly differ visually, and do these dimensions provide the foundation for the organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior? Using data-driven methods, we utilized a deep convolutional neural network to construct a visual object space extracted from deep layer activations for a reference set of objects. The first two dimensions of object space capture attributes that distinguish one object from another and may map onto the anatomical organization of the ventral visual stream of non-human primates, but its existence in humans is unclear. If object space underlies human visual cognition, this should have a measurable effect on people&#39;s object discrimination. We focused on the so-called face quadrant of object space, as there are considerable individual differences in face discrimination abilities, and a lively debate has revolved around whether such abilities are specific to faces. In this preregistered study, we collected data from a large (N=511) heterogeneous sample to amplify individual differences in visual discrimination. We primarily targeted people with self-declared face recognition abilities on opposite sides of the spectrum, ranging from poor to excellent face recognizers. We then administered a visual foraging task where faces and other objects had to be discriminated. Stimuli were carefully picked out of tens of thousands of images to either match or not match with the coordinates of faces in object space. Results showed that face discrimination did not rely on completely domain-specific abilities but also tapped into mechanisms that supported other object discrimination. Specifically, people who struggled with telling apart faces also had difficulties with discriminating other objects from the face quadrant of object space. To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first behavioral evidence for the existence of an object space in human visual cognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the omnipresence of social media, Boys Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.</p>
