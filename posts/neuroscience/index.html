B.\nScore: 74.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572654\nTo survive in evolving environments with uncertain resources, animals need to dynamically adapt their behavior and exhibit flexibility in choosing appropriate behavioral strategies, for example, to exploit familiar choices, to explore and acquire novel information, or to disengage altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal decision strategies during explore/exploit trade-offs. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioral strategies such as exploiting, exploring or disengaging from the environment, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub critical for flexible switching between behavioral strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations, calcium fiber photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behavioral tasks, we found that the MRN's main cell types, GABAergic, glutamatergic (VGluT2-positive), and serotonergic neurons, have complementary functions and drive exploitation, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons, for instance through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN, leads to perseverance in current actions and goals, and thus promotes exploitatory behavior. In contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploratory behavior. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula conveying negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioral switchboard, uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioral strategies. These circuits thus may also play an important role in the etiology and possible treatment of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.\nBrain-wide topographic coordination of traveling spiral waves\nAuthors: Ye, Z.; Bull, M. S.; Li, A.; Birman, D.; Daigle, T. L.; Tasic, B.; Zeng, H.; Steinmetz, N. A.\nScore: 91.8, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570517\nTraveling waves of activity are a prevalent phenomenon within neural networks of diverse brain regions and species1-4, and have been implicated in myriad brain functions including sensory perception5-8, memory9, spatial navigation10-12 and motor control13,14. However, the anatomical basis for these waves, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we use cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. Finally, at the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are structured by axonal pathways and globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems.\nSleepEEGpy: a Python-based package for the preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of sleep EEG data\nAuthors: Belonosov, G.; Falach, R.; Schmidig, F. J.; Aderka, M.; Zhelezniakov, V.; Shani-Hershkovich, R.; Bar, E.; Nir, Y.\nScore: 53.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572046\nSleep research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to infer brain activity in health and disease. Beyond standard sleep scoring, there is increased interest in advanced EEG analysis that investigates activities at specific times, frequencies, and scalp locations. Such analysis requires preprocessing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and dedicated analysis algorithms and visualizations. While many EEG software packages exist, sleep research has specific considerations (e.g., avoiding particular artifacts, analysis, and visualization in an ongoing non-epoch nature, detection of characteristic oscillatory events, and interface with sleep staging) that require dedicated tools. Currently, sleep investigators typically use available libraries for specific tasks in a fragmented configuration that is inefficient, prone to errors, and requires the burdensome learning of multiple software environments. Here, we present SleepEEGpy, an open-source Python package for sleep EEG data preprocessing and analysis, including (i) cleaning, (ii) independent component analysis, (iii) analysis of sleep events, (iv) analysis of spectral features, and associated visualization tools. SleepEEGpy builds upon MNE-Python, YASA, and SpecParam (formerly FOOOF) tools to provide an all-in-one package for comprehensive yet straightforward sleep EEG research. We demonstrate the SleepEEGpy pipeline and its functionalities by applying it to overnight high-density EEG data in healthy participants, revealing multiple characteristic activity signatures typical of each vigilance state. These include alpha oscillations in wakefulness, sleep spindle and slow wave activities in NREM sleep, and theta activity in REM sleep. We hope that this package will be embraced and further developed by the sleep research community, allowing investigators to focus more on science and improve reproducibility among research groups.\nA single computational objective drives specialization of streams in visual cortex\nAuthors: Finzi, D.; Margalit, E.; Kay, K.; Yamins, D. L. K.; Grill-Spector, K.\nScore: 49.1, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572460\nHuman visual cortex is organized into dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. A long-standing hypothesis is that the functional organization into streams emerged to support distinct visual behaviors. Here, we use a neural network-based computational model and a massive fMRI dataset to test how visual streams emerge. We find that models trained for stream-specific visual behaviors poorly capture neural responses and organization. Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts neural responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors, and suggest instead that functional organization arises from a single principle: balancing general representation learning with local spatial constraints.\nThe molecular basis of sugar detection by an insect taste receptor\nAuthors: Gomes, J. V. T.; Singh-Bhagania, S.; Cenci, M.; Cordon, C. C.; Singh, M.; Butterwick, J. A.\nScore: 37.9, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572227\nAnimals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules. To gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, D-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how specificity for D-fructose is seemingly achieved by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in D-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We identified the conformational change required to open the channel gate that provides an additional layer of receptor tuning in BmGr9; only D-fructose can both fit into the pocket and simultaneously engage a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the ion conducting pore. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor-ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction.\nMachine learning of brain-specific biomarkers from EEG\nAuthors: Bomatter, P.; Paillard, J.; Garces, P.; Hipp, J. F.; Engemann, D. A.\nScore: 28.7, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571864\nElectroencephalography (EEG) has a long history as a clinical tool to study brain function, and its potential to derive biomarkers for various applications is far from exhausted. Machine learning (ML) can guide future innovation by harnessing the wealth of complex EEG signals to isolate relevant brain activity. Yet, ML studies in EEG tend to ignore physiological artifacts, which may cause problems for deriving biomarkers specific to the central nervous system (CNS). We present a framework for conceptualizing machine learning from CNS versus peripheral signals measured with EEG. A common signal representation across the frequency spectrum based on Morlet wavelets allowed us to define traditional brain activity features (e.g. log power) and alternative inputs used by state-of-the-art ML approaches (covariance matrices). Using more than 2600 EEG recordings from large public databases (TUAB, TDBRAIN), we studied the impact of peripheral signals and artifact removal techniques on ML models in exemplary age- and sex-prediction analyses. Across benchmarks, basic artifact rejection improved model performance whereas further removal of peripheral signals using ICA decreased performance. Our analyses revealed that peripheral signals enable age and sex prediction. However, they explained only a fraction of the performance provided by brain signals. We show that brain signals and body signals, both reflected in the EEG, allow for prediction of personal characteristics. While these results may depend on specific prediction problems, our work suggests that great care is needed to separate these signals when the goal is to develop CNS-specific biomarkers using ML.\nEgr1 is a sex-specific regulator of neuronal chromatin, synaptic plasticity, and behaviour\nAuthors: Rocks, D.; Purisic, E.; Gallo, E. F.; Greally, J. M.; Suzuki, M.; Kundakovic, M.\nScore: 27.3, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572697\nSex differences are found in brain structure and function across species, and across brain disorders in humans. The major source of brain sex differences is differential secretion of steroid hormones from the gonads across the lifespan. Specifically, ovarian hormones oestrogens and progesterone are known to dynamically change structure and function of the adult female brain, having a major impact on psychiatric risk. However, due to limited molecular studies in female rodents, very little is still known about molecular drivers of female-specific brain and behavioural plasticity. Here we show that overexpressing Egr1, a candidate oestrous cycle-dependent transcription factor, induces sex-specific changes in ventral hippocampal neuronal chromatin, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity, along with hippocampus-dependent behaviours. Importantly, Egr1 overexpression mimics the high-oestrogenic phase of the oestrous cycle, and affects behaviours in ovarian hormone-depleted females but not in males. We demonstrate that Egr1 opens neuronal chromatin directly across the sexes, although with limited genomic overlap. Our study not only reveals the first sex-specific chromatin regulator in the brain, but also provides functional evidence that this sex-specific gene regulation drives neuronal gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Our study exemplifies an innovative sex-based approach to studying neuronal gene regulation in order to understand sex-specific synaptic and behavioural plasticity and inform novel brain disease treatments.\nDDHD2 is necessary for activity-driven fatty acid fueling of nerve terminal function\nAuthors: Kumar, M.; Wu, Y.; Knapp, J.; Park, D.; Gupta, K.; De Camilli, P.; Ryan, T. A.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572201\nHSP54, a hereditary spastic paraplegia associated with cognitive impairment, is caused by mutations in the neuron-specific triglyceride (TG) lipase DDHD2. Loss of DDHD2 function results in lipid accumulation in human brains1 and lipid droplets (LDs) in mouse neurons2. In metabolically demanding tissues, TG lipases generate a fatty acid (FA) flux from LDs to fuel mitochondrial ATP production, but neurons are considered unable to use fat as an energy source. Thus, the basis for cognitive impairment driven by DDHD2 loss remains enigmatic. To resolve this paradox, we took advantage of presynaptic sensitivity to metabolic perturbations to determine if FAs derived from LDs could power local {beta}-oxidation to support synaptic functions and whether DDHD2 activity would be required in the process. We demonstrate that nerve terminals are enriched with DDHD2 and blocking its activity leads to presynaptic accumulation of LDs. Moreover, we show that FAs derived from axonal LDs enter mitochondria in an activity-dependent fashion and drive local mitochondrial ATP production allowing nerve terminals to sustain function in the complete absence of glucose. Our data demonstrate that neurons and their nerve terminals can make use of LDs during electrical activity to provide metabolic support when glucose is in short supply.\nA bipolar taxonomy of adult human brain sulcal morphology related to timing of fetalsulcation and trans-sulcal gene expression gradients\nAuthors: Snyder, W. E.; Vertes, P. E.; Kyriakopoulou, V.; Wagstyl, K.; Williams, L. Z. J.; Moraczewski, D.; Thomas, A. G.; Karolis, V. R.; Seidlitz, J. R.; Riviere, D.; Robinson, E. C.; Mangin, J.-F.; Raznahan, A.; Bullmore, E. T.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572454\nWe developed a computational pipeline (now provided as a resource) for measuring morphological similarity between cortical surface sulci to construct a sulcal phenotype network (SPN) from each magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in an adult cohort (N=34,725; 45-82 years). Networks estimated from pairwise similarities of 40 sulci on 5 morphological metrics comprised two clusters of sulci, represented also by the bipolar distribution of sulci on a linear-to-complex dimension. Linear sulci were more heritable and typically located in unimodal cortex; complex sulci were less heritable and typically located in heteromodal cortex. Aligning these results with an independent fetal brain MRI cohort (N=228; 21-36 gestational weeks), we found that linear sulci formed earlier, and the earliest and latest-forming sulci had the least between-adult variation. Using high-resolution maps of cortical gene expression, we found that linear sulcation is mechanistically underpinned by trans-sulcal gene expression gradients enriched for developmental processes.\nSomatostatin interneurons control the timing of developmental desynchronization in cortical networks\nAuthors: Modol, L.; Moissidis, M.; Selten, M.; Oozeer, F.; Marin, O.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572767\nSynchronous neuronal activity is a hallmark of the early developing brain. In the mouse cerebral cortex, activity decorrelates during the second week of postnatal development, progressively acquiring the characteristic pattern of sparse coding underlying the integration of multidimensional sensory information. The maturation of inhibition seems critical for this process, but the specific types of interneurons involved in this crucial transition of network activity in the developing cortex remain unknown. Using in vivo volumetric and longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging during the period that precedes the change from highly synchronous to decorrelated activity, we identify somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons as critical modulators of this switch. Modulation of the activity of SST+ cells accelerates or delays the decorrelation of cortical network activity, a process that involves regulating the degree of maturation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons. SST+ cells critically link sensory inputs with local circuits controlling the neural dynamics in the developing cortex while modulating the integration of other interneurons into nascent cortical circuits.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To survive in evolving environments with uncertain resources, animals need to dynamically adapt their behavior and exhibit flexibility in choosing appropriate behavioral strategies, for example, to exploit familiar choices, to explore and acquire novel information, or to disengage altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal decision strategies during explore/exploit trade-offs. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioral strategies such as exploiting, exploring or disengaging from the environment, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub critical for flexible switching between behavioral strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations, calcium fiber photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behavioral tasks, we found that the MRN&#39;s main cell types, GABAergic, glutamatergic (VGluT2-positive), and serotonergic neurons, have complementary functions and drive exploitation, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons, for instance through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN, leads to perseverance in current actions and goals, and thus promotes exploitatory behavior. In contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2&#43; neurons drives exploratory behavior. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula conveying negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioral switchboard, uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioral strategies. These circuits thus may also play an important role in the etiology and possible treatment of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traveling waves of activity are a prevalent phenomenon within neural networks of diverse brain regions and species1-4, and have been implicated in myriad brain functions including sensory perception5-8, memory9, spatial navigation10-12 and motor control13,14. However, the anatomical basis for these waves, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we use cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. Finally, at the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are structured by axonal pathways and globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to infer brain activity in health and disease. Beyond standard sleep scoring, there is increased interest in advanced EEG analysis that investigates activities at specific times, frequencies, and scalp locations. Such analysis requires preprocessing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and dedicated analysis algorithms and visualizations. While many EEG software packages exist, sleep research has specific considerations (e.g., avoiding particular artifacts, analysis, and visualization in an ongoing non-epoch nature, detection of characteristic oscillatory events, and interface with sleep staging) that require dedicated tools. Currently, sleep investigators typically use available libraries for specific tasks in a  fragmented configuration that is inefficient, prone to errors, and requires the burdensome learning of multiple software environments. Here, we present SleepEEGpy, an open-source Python package for sleep EEG data preprocessing and analysis, including (i) cleaning, (ii) independent component analysis, (iii) analysis of sleep events, (iv) analysis of spectral features, and associated visualization tools. SleepEEGpy builds upon MNE-Python, YASA, and SpecParam (formerly FOOOF) tools to provide an all-in-one package for comprehensive yet straightforward sleep EEG research. We demonstrate the SleepEEGpy pipeline and its functionalities by applying it to overnight high-density EEG data in healthy participants, revealing multiple characteristic activity signatures typical of each vigilance state. These include alpha oscillations in wakefulness, sleep spindle and slow wave activities in NREM sleep, and theta activity in REM sleep. We hope that this package will be embraced and further developed by the sleep research community, allowing investigators to focus more on science and improve reproducibility among research groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human visual cortex is organized into dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. A long-standing hypothesis is that the functional organization into streams emerged to support distinct visual behaviors. Here, we use a neural network-based computational model and a massive fMRI dataset to test how visual streams emerge. We find that models trained for stream-specific visual behaviors poorly capture neural responses and organization. Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts neural responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors, and suggest instead that functional organization arises from a single principle: balancing general representation learning with local spatial constraints.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules. To gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, D-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how specificity for D-fructose is seemingly achieved by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in D-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We identified the conformational change required to open the channel gate that provides an additional layer of receptor tuning in BmGr9; only D-fructose can both fit into the pocket and simultaneously engage a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the ion conducting pore. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor-ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electroencephalography (EEG) has a long history as a clinical tool to study brain function, and its potential to derive biomarkers for various applications is far from exhausted. Machine learning (ML) can guide future innovation by harnessing the wealth of complex EEG signals to isolate relevant brain activity. Yet, ML studies in EEG tend to ignore physiological artifacts, which may cause problems for deriving biomarkers specific to the central nervous system (CNS). We present a framework for conceptualizing machine learning from CNS versus peripheral signals measured with EEG. A common signal representation across the frequency spectrum based on Morlet wavelets allowed us to define traditional brain activity features (e.g. log power) and alternative inputs used by state-of-the-art ML approaches (covariance matrices). Using more than 2600 EEG recordings from large public databases (TUAB, TDBRAIN), we studied the impact of peripheral signals and artifact removal techniques on ML models in exemplary age- and sex-prediction analyses. Across benchmarks, basic artifact rejection improved model performance whereas further removal of peripheral signals using ICA decreased performance. Our analyses revealed that peripheral signals enable age and sex prediction. However, they explained only a fraction of the performance provided by brain signals. We show that brain signals and body signals, both reflected in the EEG, allow for prediction of personal characteristics. While these results may depend on specific prediction problems, our work suggests that great care is needed to separate these signals when the goal is to develop CNS-specific biomarkers using ML.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex differences are found in brain structure and function across species, and across brain disorders in humans. The major source of brain sex differences is differential secretion of steroid hormones from the gonads across the lifespan. Specifically, ovarian hormones oestrogens and progesterone are known to dynamically change structure and function of the adult female brain, having a major impact on psychiatric risk. However, due to limited molecular studies in female rodents, very little is still known about molecular drivers of female-specific brain and behavioural plasticity. Here we show that overexpressing Egr1, a candidate oestrous cycle-dependent transcription factor, induces sex-specific changes in ventral hippocampal neuronal chromatin, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity, along with hippocampus-dependent behaviours. Importantly, Egr1 overexpression mimics the high-oestrogenic phase of the oestrous cycle, and affects behaviours in ovarian hormone-depleted females but not in males. We demonstrate that Egr1 opens neuronal chromatin directly across the sexes, although with limited genomic overlap. Our study not only reveals the first sex-specific chromatin regulator in the brain, but also provides functional evidence that this sex-specific gene regulation drives neuronal gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Our study exemplifies an innovative sex-based approach to studying neuronal gene regulation in order to understand sex-specific synaptic and behavioural plasticity and inform novel brain disease treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">HSP54, a hereditary spastic paraplegia associated with cognitive impairment, is caused by mutations in the neuron-specific triglyceride (TG) lipase DDHD2. Loss of DDHD2 function results in lipid accumulation in human brains1 and lipid droplets (LDs) in mouse neurons2. In metabolically demanding tissues, TG lipases generate a fatty acid (FA) flux from LDs to fuel mitochondrial ATP production, but neurons are considered unable to use fat as an energy source. Thus, the basis for cognitive impairment driven by DDHD2 loss remains enigmatic. To resolve this paradox, we took advantage of presynaptic sensitivity to metabolic perturbations to determine if FAs derived from LDs could power local {beta}-oxidation to support synaptic functions and whether DDHD2 activity would be required in the process. We demonstrate that nerve terminals are enriched with DDHD2 and blocking its activity leads to presynaptic accumulation of LDs. Moreover, we show that FAs derived from axonal LDs enter mitochondria in an activity-dependent fashion and drive local mitochondrial ATP production allowing nerve terminals to sustain function in the complete absence of glucose. Our data demonstrate that neurons and their nerve terminals can make use of LDs during electrical activity to provide metabolic support when glucose is in short supply.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We developed a computational pipeline (now provided as a resource) for measuring morphological similarity between cortical surface sulci to construct a sulcal phenotype network (SPN) from each magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in an adult cohort (N=34,725; 45-82 years). Networks estimated from pairwise similarities of 40 sulci on 5 morphological metrics comprised two clusters of sulci, represented also by the bipolar distribution of sulci on a linear-to-complex dimension. Linear sulci were more heritable and typically located in unimodal cortex; complex sulci were less heritable and typically located in heteromodal cortex. Aligning these results with an independent fetal brain MRI cohort (N=228; 21-36 gestational weeks), we found that linear sulci formed earlier, and the earliest and latest-forming sulci had the least between-adult variation. Using high-resolution maps of cortical gene expression, we found that linear sulcation is mechanistically underpinned by trans-sulcal gene expression gradients enriched for developmental processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synchronous neuronal activity is a hallmark of the early developing brain. In the mouse cerebral cortex, activity decorrelates during the second week of postnatal development, progressively acquiring the characteristic pattern of sparse coding underlying the integration of multidimensional sensory information. The maturation of inhibition seems critical for this process, but the specific types of interneurons involved in this crucial transition of network activity in the developing cortex remain unknown. Using in vivo volumetric and longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging during the period that precedes the change from highly synchronous to decorrelated activity, we identify somatostatin-expressing (SST&#43;) interneurons as critical modulators of this switch. Modulation of the activity of SST&#43; cells accelerates or delays the decorrelation of cortical network activity, a process that involves regulating the degree of maturation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV&#43;) interneurons. SST&#43; cells critically link sensory inputs with local circuits controlling the neural dynamics in the developing cortex while modulating the integration of other interneurons into nascent cortical circuits.</p>
