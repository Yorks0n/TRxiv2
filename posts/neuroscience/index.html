However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.\nWhole-cortex in situ sequencing reveals peripheral input-dependent cell type-defined area identity\nAuthors: Chen, X.; Fischer, S.; Rue, M. C.; Zhang, A.; Mukherjee, D.; Kanold, P. O.; Gillis, J.; Zador, A.\nScore: 144.0, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.06.515380\nThe cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.\nA dual-pathway architecture enables chronic stress to promote habit formation\nAuthors: Giovanniello, J. R.; Paredes, N.; Wiener, A.; Ramirez-Armenta, K.; Oragwam, C.; Uwadia, H. O.; Lim, K.; Nnamdi, G.; Wang, A.; Sehgal, M.; Reis, F. M.; Sias, A. C.; Silva, A. J.; Adhikari, A.; Malvaez, M.; Wassum, K. M.\nScore: 43.4, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560731\nChronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions by promoting the formation of inflexible, potentially maladaptive, habits. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual pathway, amygdala-striatal, neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress shapes learning to disrupt flexible goal-directed behavior in favor of inflexible habits. Chronic stress inhibits activity of basolateral amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to impede the action-outcome learning that supports flexible, goal-directed decisions. Stress also increases activity in direct central amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to promote the formation of rigid, inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala-striatal pathways to promote premature habit formation. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision making, and help understand how stress can lead to the disrupted decision making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions.\nSynaptic Basis of Behavioral Timescale Plasticity\nAuthors: Gonzalez, K. C.; Negrean, A.; Liao, Z.; Polleux, F.; Losonczy, A.\nScore: 43.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560848\nLearning and memory are fundamental to adaptive behavior and cognition. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of feature selectivity in neurons underlying episodic memory. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at single-neuron resolution in awake-behaving animals. Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) postulates that synaptic inputs active during a seconds-long time window preceding and immediately following a large depolarizing plateau spike are potentiated, while synaptic inputs active outside this time window are depressed. We experimentally tested this model in vivo in awake-behaving mice using an all-optical approach by inducing place fields (PFs) in single CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1PNs) while monitoring the spatiotemporal tuning of individual dendritic spines and changes in their corresponding synaptic weights. We identified an asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around plateau burst induction. Surprisingly, our work also uncovered compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal and oblique dendrites of CA1PNs. Our results provide the first experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.\nMulti-donor human cortical Chimeroids reveal individual susceptibility to neurotoxic triggers\nAuthors: Anton-Bolanos, N.; Faravelli, I.; Faits, T.; Andreadis, S.; Trattaro, S.; Kastli, R.; Adiconis, X.; Di Bella, D. J.; Tegtmeyer, M.; Nehme, R.; Levin, J. Z.; Regev, A.; Arlotta, P.\nScore: 34.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.558331\nInter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain \"Chimeroids\", a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.\nThe COMBO window: A chronic cranial implant for multiscale circuit interrogation in mice\nAuthors: Edelman, B.; Siegenthaler, D.; Wanken, P.; Jenkins, B.; Schmid, B.; Ressle, A.; Gogolla, N.; Frank, T.; Mace, E.\nScore: 29.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560470\nNeuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca2+ imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures, and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant - the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multi-site two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.\nCue-specific neuronal ensembles span intermittent rate coding of working memory\nAuthors: Panichello, M. F.; Jonikaitis, D.; Oh, J.; Zhu, S.; Trepka, E. B.; Moore, T.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561121\nPersistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory. However, emerging evidence suggests a possible role for 'activity-silent' synaptic mechanisms. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely depended on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. We show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of prefrontal neurons, but instead alternates between 'On' and 'Off' periods during memory delays. At the level of single neurons, Off periods are driven by a coordinated loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to baseline levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings, we asked whether the functional connectivity among large neuronal ensembles depended on information held in working memory. We show that mnemonic information is available in the pattern of ensemble connectivity during the memory delay in both On and Off periods of neuronal activity. Intermittent epochs of memoranda-specific spiking therefore coexist with activity-silent mechanisms to span memory delays.\nCadherins orchestrate specific patterns of perisomatic inhibition onto distinct pyramidal cell populations\nAuthors: Jezequel, J.; Condomitti, G.; Kroon, T.; Hamid, F.; Sanalidou, S.; Garces, T.; Maeso, P.; Balia, M.; Rico, B.\nScore: 28.0, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559922\nIn the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells are assembled into distinct subnetworks, which project to different brain areas. GABAergic interneurons were long thought to connect promiscuously and extensively to pyramidal neurons, but recent evidence supports the existence of a cell type-specific inhibitory connectome. How and when interneurons establish such a precise connectivity pattern among intermingled populations of excitatory neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular rules shaping cell type- and input-specific inhibitory connectivity in different Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell populations. We found that neighboring L5 intra- (L5 IT) and extra-telencephalic (L5 ET) neurons receive different combinations of inhibitory perisomatic inputs from Parvalbumin- (PV+) and Cholecystokynine-positive (CCK+) basket cells. We also identified Cdh12 and Cdh13, two cadherin superfamily members, as critical mediators of L5 pyramidal cell type-specific inhibitory connectivity. Our data revealed a minimal overlap between L5 IT and L5 ET presynaptic inhibitory networks, and suggests that different populations PV+ basket cells innervate distinct L5 pyramidal cell types. Altogether, our work unravels the contribution of cadherins in shaping cortical interneuron wiring and provides new insights into the development of inhibitory microcircuits.\nAstrocytes Control Recent and Remote Memory Strength by Affecting the Recruitment of the CA1-\u003eACC Projection to Engrams\nAuthors: Refaeli, R.; Kreisel, T.; Groysman, M.; Goshen, I.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-10-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561396\nRecent and remote memories are encoded throughout the brain in 'Engrams': cell ensembles formed during acquisition, and upon their reactivation, a specific memory can be recalled. The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1-\u003eACC). Various modifications to CA1 astrocytes, to the Gq- or Gi- GPCR pathways, during memory acquisition were shown to affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address the inconsistency, we applied transgenic approaches for ensemble identification, CLARITY, retro-AAV virus for circuit mapping, and chemogenetics in astrocytes for functional investigation. We manipulated the activity of either Gq- or Gi- pathways in CA1 astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged cFos+ engram cells and CA1-\u003eACC cells during recent and remote recall in the same animals. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1-\u003eACC projection cells to the engram, demonstrated by the number of CA1-\u003eACC projecting cells in the engram as well as the number of axons projecting from the CA1 engram toward the ACC: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1-\u003eACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, when activating the Gi pathway in astrocytes during acquisition, only remote recall was impaired, and CA1-\u003eACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that astrocytes control behavioral performance by targeting the CA1-\u003eACC projection. Specifically, that Gq- and Gi- pathway activation affect memory differently, but do so by modulating the same mechanism. These findings illuminate the importance of astrocytes in the acquisition of fear memory and their implications on recent and remote recall.\nNeural correlates of visual object recognition in rats\nAuthors: Rhee, J. Y.; Echavarria, C.; Soucy, E.; Greenwood, J.; Masis, J. A.; Cox, D. D.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.555183\nInvariant object recognition--the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context--is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Although initially believed to be unique to primates due to its complexity, emerging evidence suggests rodents, too, can recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. Here, we describe a comprehensive pipeline for investigating visual behavior in rats, from high-throughput training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Using this suite of tools, we demonstrate that rats excel in visual object recognition and explore potential neural pathways which may support this capacity. We leverage our optical approach to systematically profile multiple visual areas with responses to a range of stimulus types recorded in the same neurons. Primary and higher-order areas of rat visual cortex exhibit a hierarchical organization consistent with a role in visual object recognition. However, marked deviations from the functional organization of primate visual cortex suggest species-specific differences in the neural circuits underlying visual object recognition. This work reinforces the notion that rats possess sophisticated visual abilities and offers the technical foundation for their use as a powerful model to link neuronal responses to perception and behavior.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a wide range of &#34;long COVID&#34; neurological symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions by promoting the formation of inflexible, potentially maladaptive, habits. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual pathway, amygdala-striatal, neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress shapes learning to disrupt flexible goal-directed behavior in favor of inflexible habits. Chronic stress inhibits activity of basolateral amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to impede the action-outcome learning that supports flexible, goal-directed decisions. Stress also increases activity in direct central amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to promote the formation of rigid, inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala-striatal pathways to promote premature habit formation. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision making, and help understand how stress can lead to the disrupted decision making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning and memory are fundamental to adaptive behavior and cognition. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of feature selectivity in neurons underlying episodic memory. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at single-neuron resolution in awake-behaving animals. Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) postulates that synaptic inputs active during a seconds-long time window preceding and immediately following a large depolarizing plateau spike are potentiated, while synaptic inputs active outside this time window are depressed. We experimentally tested this model in vivo in awake-behaving mice using an all-optical approach by inducing place fields (PFs) in single CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1PNs) while monitoring the spatiotemporal tuning of individual dendritic spines and changes in their corresponding synaptic weights. We identified an asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around plateau burst induction. Surprisingly, our work also uncovered compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal and oblique dendrites of CA1PNs. Our results provide the first experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain &#34;Chimeroids&#34;, a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca2&#43; imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures, and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant - the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multi-site two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Persistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory. However, emerging evidence suggests a possible role for &#39;activity-silent&#39; synaptic mechanisms. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely depended on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. We show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of prefrontal neurons, but instead alternates between &#39;On&#39; and &#39;Off&#39; periods during memory delays. At the level of single neurons, Off periods are driven by a coordinated loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to baseline levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings, we asked whether the functional connectivity among large neuronal ensembles depended on information held in working memory. We show that mnemonic information is available in the pattern of ensemble connectivity during the memory delay in both On and Off periods of neuronal activity. Intermittent epochs of memoranda-specific spiking therefore coexist with activity-silent mechanisms to span memory delays.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells are assembled into distinct subnetworks, which project to different brain areas. GABAergic interneurons were long thought to connect promiscuously and extensively to pyramidal neurons, but recent evidence supports the existence of a cell type-specific inhibitory connectome. How and when interneurons establish such a precise connectivity pattern among intermingled populations of excitatory neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular rules shaping cell type- and input-specific inhibitory connectivity in different Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell populations. We found that neighboring L5 intra- (L5 IT) and extra-telencephalic (L5 ET) neurons receive different combinations of inhibitory perisomatic inputs from Parvalbumin- (PV&#43;) and Cholecystokynine-positive (CCK&#43;) basket cells. We also identified Cdh12 and Cdh13, two cadherin superfamily members, as critical mediators of L5 pyramidal cell type-specific inhibitory connectivity. Our data revealed a minimal overlap between L5 IT and L5 ET presynaptic inhibitory networks, and suggests that different populations PV&#43; basket cells innervate distinct L5 pyramidal cell types. Altogether, our work unravels the contribution of cadherins in shaping cortical interneuron wiring and provides new insights into the development of inhibitory microcircuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent and remote memories are encoded throughout the brain in &#39;Engrams&#39;: cell ensembles formed during acquisition, and upon their reactivation, a specific memory can be recalled. The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1-&gt;ACC). Various modifications to CA1 astrocytes, to the Gq- or Gi- GPCR pathways, during memory acquisition were shown to affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address the inconsistency, we applied transgenic approaches for ensemble identification, CLARITY, retro-AAV virus for circuit mapping, and chemogenetics in astrocytes for functional investigation. We manipulated the activity of either Gq- or Gi- pathways in CA1 astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged cFos&#43; engram cells and CA1-&gt;ACC cells during recent and remote recall in the same animals. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1-&gt;ACC projection cells to the engram, demonstrated by the number of CA1-&gt;ACC projecting cells in the engram as well as the number of axons projecting from the CA1 engram toward the ACC: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1-&gt;ACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, when activating the Gi pathway in astrocytes during acquisition, only remote recall was impaired, and CA1-&gt;ACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that astrocytes control behavioral performance by targeting the CA1-&gt;ACC projection. Specifically, that Gq- and Gi- pathway activation affect memory differently, but do so by modulating the same mechanism. These findings illuminate the importance of astrocytes in the acquisition of fear memory and their implications on recent and remote recall.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invariant object recognition--the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context--is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Although initially believed to be unique to primates due to its complexity, emerging evidence suggests rodents, too, can recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. Here, we describe a comprehensive pipeline for investigating visual behavior in rats, from high-throughput training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Using this suite of tools, we demonstrate that rats excel in visual object recognition and explore potential neural pathways which may support this capacity. We leverage our optical approach to systematically profile multiple visual areas with responses to a range of stimulus types recorded in the same neurons. Primary and higher-order areas of rat visual cortex exhibit a hierarchical organization consistent with a role in visual object recognition. However, marked deviations from the functional organization of primate visual cortex suggest species-specific differences in the neural circuits underlying visual object recognition. This work reinforces the notion that rats possess sophisticated visual abilities and offers the technical foundation for their use as a powerful model to link neuronal responses to perception and behavior.</p>
