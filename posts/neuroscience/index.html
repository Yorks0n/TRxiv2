These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.\nLearning produces a hippocampal cognitive map in the form of an orthogonalized state machine\nAuthors: Sun, W.; Winnubst, J.; Natrajan, M.; Lai, C.; Kajikawa, K.; Michaelos, M.; Gattoni, R.; Fitzgerald, J. E.; Spruston, N.\nScore: 102.6, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551900\nCognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.\nWithin-Individual Organization of the Human Cerebral Cortex: Networks, Global Topography, and Function\nAuthors: Du, J.; DiNicola, L. M.; Angeli, P. A.; Saadon-Grosman, N.; Sun, W.; Kaiser, S.; Ladopoulou, J.; Xue, A.; Yeo, B. T. T.; Eldaief, M. C.; Buckner, R. L.\nScore: 39.0, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552437\nThe human cerebral cortex is populated by specialized regions that are organized into networks. Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian sModel (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.\nBRAND: A platform for closed-loop experiments with deep network models\nAuthors: Ali, Y.

D.; Miller, L. E.; Brandman, D. M.; Pandarinath, C.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552473\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g., Python and Julia) while maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing (e.g., C and C++). To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in BRAND with minimal implementation changes. In our tests, BRAND achieved \u003c600 microsecond latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 1-millisecond chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with less than 8 milliseconds of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. By providing a framework that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.\nA collaboration between immune cells and the choroid plexus epithelium in brain inflammation\nAuthors: Xu, H.; Lotfy, P.; Gelb, S.; Pragana, A.; Hehnly, C.; Shipley, F. B.; Zawadzki, M. E.; Cui, J.; Deng, L.; Taylor, M.; Webb, M.; Lidov, H. G. W.; Andermann, M. L.; Chiu, I. M.; Ordovas-Montanes, J.; Lehtinen, M. K.\nScore: 35.3, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552298\nThe choroid plexus (ChP) is a vital brain barrier and source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we use chronic two-photon imaging in awake mice and single-cell transcriptomics to demonstrate that in addition to these roles, the ChP is a complex immune organ that regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse meningitis model, neutrophils and monocytes accumulated in ChP stroma and surged across the epithelial barrier into the CSF. Bi-directional recruitment of monocytes from the periphery and, unexpectedly, macrophages from the CSF to the ChP helped eliminate neutrophils and repair the barrier. Transcriptomic analyses detailed the molecular steps accompanying this process, including the discovery of epithelial cells that transiently specialized to nurture immune cells, coordinate their recruitment, survival, and differentiation, and ultimately, control the opening/closing of the ChP brain barrier. Collectively, we provide a new conceptual understanding and comprehensive roadmap of neuroinflammation at the ChP brain barrier.\nExpansion of a frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression\nAuthors: Lynch, C. J.; Elbau, I.; Ng, T.; Ayaz, A.; Zhu, S.; Manfredi, N.; Johnson, M.; Wolk, D.; Power, J. D.; Gordon, E. M.; Kay, K.; Aloysi, A.; Moia, S.; Gaudes, C. C.; Victoria, L. W.; Solomonov, N.; Goldwaser, E.; Zebley, B.; Grosenick, L.; Downar, J.; Vila-Rodriguez, F.; Daskalakis, Z. J.; Blumberger, D. M.; Williams, N.; Gunning, F.; Liston, C.\nScore: 26.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.551651\nHundreds of neuroimaging studies spanning two decades have revealed only modest differences in brain structure and functional connectivity in depression, complicating efforts to derive mechanistic pathophysiologic insights or develop biomarkers. Furthermore, although depression is a fundamentally episodic condition, few neuroimaging studies have taken a longitudinal approach, which is critical for understanding cause and effect and delineating mechanisms that drive mood state transitions over time. The emerging field of precision functional mapping using densely-sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data has revealed unexpected, functionally meaningful individual differences in brain network topology in healthy individuals, but these approaches have never been applied to individuals with depression. Here, using precision functional mapping techniques and 11 datasets comprising n=187 repeatedly-sampled individuals and \u003e21,000 minutes of fMRI data, we show that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded two-fold in most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in multiple samples and caused primarily by network border shifts affecting specific functional systems, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was unexpectedly stable over time, unaffected by changes in mood state, and detectable in children before the subsequent onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in specific frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptom domains and predicted future anhedonia symptoms before they emerged. Together, these findings identify a stable trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.\nBasolateral amygdala parvalbumin interneurons coordinate oscillations to drive reward behaviors\nAuthors: Amaya, K. A.; Teboul, E.; Weiss, G. L.; Antonoudiou, P.; Maguire, J.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552674\nThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in mediating both fear and reward learning. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) in the BLA have previously been shown to contribute to BLA oscillatory states integral to fear expression, but whether BLA oscillatory states and PV interneurons also contribute to reward learning is unknown and critical to our understanding of reward processing. Local field potentials in the BLA were collected as animals consumed a sucrose reward, where prominent changes in the beta band (15-30 Hz) emerged with reward experience. Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons to entrain the BLA network to 20Hz during consumption of one bottle during a two-bottle choice test produced a robust bottle preference. Finally, to demonstrate that PV activity is necessary for reward value use, PVs were chemogenetically targeted and inhibited following outcome devaluation, rendering those animals incapable of using updated reward value information to guide their behavior. Taken together, these experiments provide novel information regarding the physiological signatures of reward learning while highlighting the importance of PV interneurons in reward learning. This work builds upon the fields established knowledge of PV involvement in fear expression and provides evidence that PV orchestration of unique BLA network states is involved in both learning types.\nLearning attentional templates for value-based decision-making\nAuthors: Jahn, C. I.; Markov, N. T.; Morea, B.; Ebitz, B.; Buschman, T. J.\nScore: 31.9, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550426\nAttention filters sensory inputs to enhance task-relevant information. It is guided by an attentional template that represents the stimulus features that are relevant for the current task. To understand how the brain learns and uses new templates, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task that required them to repeatedly learn new attentional templates. Neural recordings found templates were represented across prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template towards rewarded features. Finally, we found attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template. Altogether, our results provide new insight into the neural mechanisms by which the brain learns to control attention and how attention can be flexibly deployed across tasks.\nA developmental increase of inhibition promotes the emergence of hippocampal ripples\nAuthors: Pochinok, I.; Stöber, T. M.; Triesch, J.; Chini, M.; Hanganu-Opatz, I. L.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552951\nSharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are a hippocampal network phenomenon critical for memory consolidation and planning. SPW-Rs have been extensively studied in the adult brain, yet their developmental trajectory is poorly understood. While SPWs have been recorded in rodents shortly after birth, the time point and mechanisms of ripple emergence are still unclear. Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12 days-old mice to address this knowledge gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation of ChR2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day (P) 10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons. Finally, we show that early SPW-Rs elicit a more robust prefrontal cortex response then SPWs lacking ripples. Thus, development of inhibition promotes ripples emergence.\nDaytime experiences shape neural activity and dream content in the sleeping brain\nAuthors: Kumral, D.; Palmieri, J.; Gais, S.; Schoenauer, M.\nScore: 51.7, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551087\nLearning-related brain activity patterns are replayed during sleep, and memories of recent experiences appear in our dreams. The connection between these phenomena, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether memory reinstatement during sleep contributes to dreaming. Participants listened to audiobooks before falling asleep. We could determine which audiobook they had studied based on dream reports collected during the night. Audiobook content was also reinstated at the neural level, in high-density EEG recordings. Brain activity during rapid eye movement sleep, particularly in the high-frequency beta range, carried information about the audiobook and simultaneously benefitted memory retention. Crucially, when the learning condition was manifest in neural activity, it also emerged in dreams. Reprocessing of daytime experiences during sleep thus shapes our brain activity, our dreams, and our memories.\n",

        <p class="abstract">When animals move through space, neurons in their entorhinal cortex activate periodically at multiple locations to form a map of the spatial environment. These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human cerebral cortex is populated by specialized regions that are organized into networks. Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian sModel (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g., Python and Julia) while maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing (e.g., C and C&#43;&#43;). To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in BRAND with minimal implementation changes. In our tests, BRAND achieved &lt;600 microsecond latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 1-millisecond chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with less than 8 milliseconds of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. By providing a framework that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The choroid plexus (ChP) is a vital brain barrier and source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we use chronic two-photon imaging in awake mice and single-cell transcriptomics to demonstrate that in addition to these roles, the ChP is a complex immune organ that regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse meningitis model, neutrophils and monocytes accumulated in ChP stroma and surged across the epithelial barrier into the CSF. Bi-directional recruitment of monocytes from the periphery and, unexpectedly, macrophages from the CSF to the ChP helped eliminate neutrophils and repair the barrier. Transcriptomic analyses detailed the molecular steps accompanying this process, including the discovery of epithelial cells that transiently specialized to nurture immune cells, coordinate their recruitment, survival, and differentiation, and ultimately, control the opening/closing of the ChP brain barrier. Collectively, we provide a new conceptual understanding and comprehensive roadmap of neuroinflammation at the ChP brain barrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hundreds of neuroimaging studies spanning two decades have revealed only modest differences in brain structure and functional connectivity in depression, complicating efforts to derive mechanistic pathophysiologic insights or develop biomarkers. Furthermore, although depression is a fundamentally episodic condition, few neuroimaging studies have taken a longitudinal approach, which is critical for understanding cause and effect and delineating mechanisms that drive mood state transitions over time. The emerging field of precision functional mapping using densely-sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data has revealed unexpected, functionally meaningful individual differences in brain network topology in healthy individuals, but these approaches have never been applied to individuals with depression. Here, using precision functional mapping techniques and 11 datasets comprising n=187 repeatedly-sampled individuals and &gt;21,000 minutes of fMRI data, we show that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded two-fold in most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in multiple samples and caused primarily by network border shifts affecting specific functional systems, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was unexpectedly stable over time, unaffected by changes in mood state, and detectable in children before the subsequent onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in specific frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptom domains and predicted future anhedonia symptoms before they emerged. Together, these findings identify a stable trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in mediating both fear and reward learning. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) in the BLA have previously been shown to contribute to BLA oscillatory states integral to fear expression, but whether BLA oscillatory states and PV interneurons also contribute to reward learning is unknown and critical to our understanding of reward processing. Local field potentials in the BLA were collected as animals consumed a sucrose reward, where prominent changes in the beta band (15-30 Hz) emerged with reward experience. Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons to entrain the BLA network to 20Hz during consumption of one bottle during a two-bottle choice test produced a robust bottle preference. Finally, to demonstrate that PV activity is necessary for reward value use, PVs were chemogenetically targeted and inhibited following outcome devaluation, rendering those animals incapable of using updated reward value information to guide their behavior. Taken together, these experiments provide novel information regarding the physiological signatures of reward learning while highlighting the importance of PV interneurons in reward learning. This work builds upon the fields established knowledge of PV involvement in fear expression and provides evidence that PV orchestration of unique BLA network states is involved in both learning types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Attention filters sensory inputs to enhance task-relevant information. It is guided by an  attentional template that represents the stimulus features that are relevant for the current task. To understand how the brain learns and uses new templates, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task that required them to repeatedly learn new attentional templates. Neural recordings found templates were represented across prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template towards rewarded features. Finally, we found attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template. Altogether, our results provide new insight into the neural mechanisms by which the brain learns to control attention and how attention can be flexibly deployed across tasks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are a hippocampal network phenomenon critical for memory consolidation and planning. SPW-Rs have been extensively studied in the adult brain, yet their developmental trajectory is poorly understood. While SPWs have been recorded in rodents shortly after birth, the time point and mechanisms of ripple emergence are still unclear. Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12 days-old mice to address this knowledge gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation of ChR2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day (P) 10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons. Finally, we show that early SPW-Rs elicit a more robust prefrontal cortex response then SPWs lacking ripples. Thus, development of inhibition promotes ripples emergence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning-related brain activity patterns are replayed during sleep, and memories of recent experiences appear in our dreams. The connection between these phenomena, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether memory reinstatement during sleep contributes to dreaming. Participants listened to audiobooks before falling asleep. We could determine which audiobook they had studied based on dream reports collected during the night. Audiobook content was also reinstated at the neural level, in high-density EEG recordings. Brain activity during rapid eye movement sleep, particularly in the high-frequency beta range, carried information about the audiobook and simultaneously benefitted memory retention. Crucially, when the learning condition was manifest in neural activity, it also emerged in dreams. Reprocessing of daytime experiences during sleep thus shapes our brain activity, our dreams, and our memories.</p>
