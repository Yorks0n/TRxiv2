B.; Libermann, T. A.; Lehtinen, M. K.\nScore: 47.0, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574486\nWe discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brains ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.\nSARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease activates nociceptors to drive sneeze and pain\nAuthors: Mali, S. S.; Silva, R.; Gong, Z.; Cronce, M.; Vo, U.; Vuong, C.; Moayedi, Y.; Cox, J. S.; Bautista, D. M.\nScore: 38.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575114\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.\nGrid cells perform path integration in multiple reference frames during self-motion-based navigation\nAuthors: Peng, J.-J.; Throm, B.; Najafian Jazi, M.; Yen, T.-Y.; Monyer, H.; Allen, K.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572857\nWith their periodic firing pattern, grid cells are considered a fundamental unit of a neural network performing path integration. The periodic firing patterns of grid cells have been observed mainly during behaviors with little navigational demands, and the firing patterns of grid cells in animals navigating 2D environments using path integration are largely unknown. Here, we recorded the activity of grid cells in mice performing the AutoPI task, a task assessing homing based on path integration. Using artificial deep neural networks to decode the animals moment-to-moment movement vectors, we found that grid cells perform path integration over short trajectories and change their reference frames within single trials. More specifically, grid cell modules re-anchor to a task-relevant object via a translation of the grid pattern. The code for movement direction in grid modules drifts as the animal navigates using self-motion cues, and this drift predicts the homing direction of the mouse. These results reveal the computations in grid cell circuits during self-motion-based navigation.\nA developmental brain-wide screen identifies retrosplenial cortex as a key player in the emergence of persistent memory\nAuthors: Jin, B.; Gongwer, M. W.; Ohanian, L.; Holden-Wingate, L.; Le, B.; Darmawan, A.; Nakayama, Y.; Mora, S. A. R.; DeNardo, L. A.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574554\nMemories formed early in life are short-lived while those formed later persist. Recent work revealed that infant memories are stored in a latent state. But why they fail to be retrieved is poorly understood. Here we investigated brain-wide circuit mechanisms underlying infantile amnesia in mice. We performed a screen that combined activity-dependent neuronal tagging at different postnatal ages, tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy. We observed striking developmental transitions in the organization of fear memory networks and changes in the activity and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) that aligned with the emergence of persistent memory. 7 days after learning, chemogenetic reactivation of tagged RSP ensembles enhanced memory in adults but not in infants. But after 33 days, reactivating infant-tagged RSP ensembles recovered forgotten memories. These studies show that RSP ensembles store latent infant memories, reveal the time course of RSP functional maturation, and suggest that immature RSP functional networks contribute to infantile amnesia.\nPrefrontal cortical dynorphin peptidergic transmission constrains threat-driven behavioral and network states\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Flores, R.

A.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574700\nPrefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits provide top-down control of threat reactivity. This includes ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) circuitry, which plays a role in suppressing fear-related behavioral states. Dynorphin (Dyn) has been implicated in mediating negative affect and mal-adaptive behaviors induced by severe threats and is expressed in limbic circuits, including the vmPFC. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of how vmPFC Dyn-expressing neurons and Dyn transmission detect threats and regulate expression of defensive behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that Dyn cells are broadly activated by threats and release Dyn locally in the vmPFC to limit passive defensive behaviors. We further demonstrate that vmPFC Dyn-mediated signaling promotes a switch of vmPFC networks to a fear-related state. In conclusion, we reveal a previously unknown role of vmPFC Dyn neurons and Dyn neuropeptidergic transmission in suppressing defensive behaviors in response to threats via state-driven changes in vmPFC networks.

L.; Yonehara, K.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574952\nGABA ({gamma}-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). There is a wide range of GABAergic neuronal types, each of which plays an important role in neural processing and the etiology of neurological disorders. However, there is no comprehensive understanding of this functional diversity, due to the lack of genetic tools to target and study the multitude of cell types. Here we perform two-photon imaging of GABA release in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina using the newly developed GABA sensor iGABASnFR2. By applying varied light stimuli to isolated retinae, we reveal over 40 different GABA-releasing neurons, including some not previously described. Individual types show unique distributions of synaptic release sites in the sublayers comprising the IPL, allowing layer-specific visual encoding. Synaptic input and output sites are aligned along specific retinal orientations for multiple neuronal types. Furthermore, computational modeling reveals that the combination of cell type-specific spatial structure and unique release kinetics enables inhibitory neurons to suppress and sculpt excitatory signals in response to a wide range of behaviorally relevant motion structures. Our high-throughput approach provides the first comprehensive physiological characterization of inhibitory signaling in the vertebrate CNS. Future applications of this method will enable interrogation of the function and dysfunction of diverse inhibitory circuits in health and disease.\nBehavioral screening of conserved RNA-binding proteins reveals CEY-1/YBX RNA-binding protein dysfunction leads to impairments in memory and cognition\nAuthors: Hayden, A. N.; Brandel, K. L.; Merlau, P. R.; Vijayakumar, P.; Leptich, E. J.; Pietryk, E. W.; Gaytan, E. S.; Ni, C. W.; Chao, H.-T.; Rosenfeld, J. A.; Arey, R. N.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574402\nRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of translation and plasticity in the nervous system, which are processes required for learning and memory. Indeed, RBP dysfunction has been linked to a wide range of neurological disorders where cognitive impairments are a key symptom. However, the human genome encodes nearly 2,000 RBPs, many of which have yet to be characterized with regards to neurological phenotypes like associative behaviors. To address this, we used the model organism C. elegans to perform a targeted screen assessing the role of 20 conserved RBPs in learning and memory. We identified 16 associative memory regulators, eight of which are novel. Intriguingly, three novel memory regulators are in the C. elegans Y-Box (CEY) RNA-binding protein family: cey-1, cey-2, and cey-3. We determined that cey-1 is the closest ortholog to the mammalian Y-Box RNA-binding (YBX) proteins and that CEY-1 is specifically required in the nervous system for the ability to remember. Additionally, CEY-1 is a memory promoting molecule, as increasing CEY-1 only in the nervous system improves memory. We also examined human copy number variation datasets and found that copy number deletions in the human YBX1 and YBX3 may be associated with neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, which mirror our findings in C. elegans. We identified a similar association with a rare, mono-allelic YBX3 variant in individuals with neurological findings. Strikingly, introducing this predicted deleterious YBX3 variant into the endogenous cey-1 locus caused memory deficits in the worm. Our study highlights that high-throughput approaches in the worm reveal novel and conserved regulators of memory and identified a potential new source of rare neurological disease linked to RBP dysfunction.\nPsilocybin Promotes Cell-Type-Specific Changes in the Orbitofrontal Cortex Revealed by Single-Nucleus RNA-seq\nAuthors: Huang, Z.; Wei, X.; Wang, Y.; Tian, J.; Dong, J.; Liang, B.; Lu, L.; Zhang, W.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.573163\nRecent clinical breakthroughs hold great promise for the application of psilocybin in the treatments of psychological disorders, such as depression, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psilocybin is a psychedelic whose metabolite, psilocin, is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of psilocybin on the brain are not fully illustrated, and cell type-specific and circuit effects of psilocybin are not fully understood. Here, we combined single-nucleus RNA-seq with functional assays to study the long-term effects of psilocybin on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region vulnerable to psychological disorders such as depression. We showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced long-term genetic and functional changes in neurons of the OFC, and excitatory and inhibitory neurons collectively reduced circuit activity of the brain region. Knockdown of 5-HT2A receptor in deep layer excitatory neurons abated psilocybin-induced functional changes and the anti-depressant effect. Together, these results showed the cell type-specific mechanisms of psilocybin and shed light on the brain region difference in the effect of psychedelics.\nAn adaptable, reusable, and light implant for chronic Neuropixels probes\nAuthors: Bimbard, C.; Takacs, F.; Catarino, J.

M.; Carandini, M.; Coen, P.\nScore: 44.7, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551752\nElectrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. Here, we present the \"Apollo Implant\", an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a \"payload\" module that is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a \"docking\" module that is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across seven labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.\nDynamical constraints on neural population activity\nAuthors: Oby, E. R.; Degenhart, A. D.; Grigsby, E. M.; Motiwala, A.; McClain, N. T.; Marino, P. J.; Yu, B.; Batista, A. P.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573543\nThe manner in which neural activity unfolds over time is thought to be central to sensory, motor, and cognitive functions in the brain. Network models have long posited that the brains computations involve time courses of activity that are shaped by the underlying network. A prediction from this view is that the activity time courses should be difficult to violate. We leveraged a brain-computer interface (BCI) to challenge monkeys to violate the naturally-occurring time courses of neural population activity that we observed in motor cortex. This included challenging animals to traverse the natural time course of neural activity in a time-reversed manner. Animals were unable to violate the natural time courses of neural activity when directly challenged to do so. These results provide empirical support for the view that activity time courses observed in the brain indeed reflect the underlying network-level computational mechanisms that they are believed to implement.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brains ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With their periodic firing pattern, grid cells are considered a fundamental unit of a neural network performing path integration. The periodic firing patterns of grid cells have been observed mainly during behaviors with little navigational demands, and the firing patterns of grid cells in animals navigating 2D environments using path integration are largely unknown. Here, we recorded the activity of grid cells in mice performing the AutoPI task, a task assessing homing based on path integration. Using artificial deep neural networks to decode the animals moment-to-moment movement vectors, we found that grid cells perform path integration over short trajectories and change their reference frames within single trials. More specifically, grid cell modules re-anchor to a task-relevant object via a translation of the grid pattern. The code for movement direction in grid modules drifts as the animal navigates using self-motion cues, and this drift predicts the homing direction of the mouse. These results reveal the computations in grid cell circuits during self-motion-based navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memories formed early in life are short-lived while those formed later persist. Recent work revealed that infant memories are stored in a latent state. But why they fail to be retrieved is poorly understood. Here we investigated brain-wide circuit mechanisms underlying infantile amnesia in mice. We performed a screen that combined activity-dependent neuronal tagging at different postnatal ages, tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy. We observed striking developmental transitions in the organization of fear memory networks and changes in the activity and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) that aligned with the emergence of persistent memory. 7 days after learning, chemogenetic reactivation of tagged RSP ensembles enhanced memory in adults but not in infants. But after 33 days, reactivating infant-tagged RSP ensembles recovered forgotten memories. These studies show that RSP ensembles store latent infant memories, reveal the time course of RSP functional maturation, and suggest that immature RSP functional networks contribute to infantile amnesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits provide top-down control of threat reactivity. This includes ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) circuitry, which plays a role in suppressing fear-related behavioral states. Dynorphin (Dyn) has been implicated in mediating negative affect and mal-adaptive behaviors induced by severe threats and is expressed in limbic circuits, including the vmPFC. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of how vmPFC Dyn-expressing neurons and Dyn transmission detect threats and regulate expression of defensive behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that Dyn cells are broadly activated by threats and release Dyn locally in the vmPFC to limit passive defensive behaviors. We further demonstrate that vmPFC Dyn-mediated signaling promotes a switch of vmPFC networks to a fear-related state. In conclusion, we reveal a previously unknown role of vmPFC Dyn neurons and Dyn neuropeptidergic transmission in suppressing defensive behaviors in response to threats via state-driven changes in vmPFC networks.

        <p class="abstract">GABA ({gamma}-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). There is a wide range of GABAergic neuronal types, each of which plays an important role in neural processing and the etiology of neurological disorders. However, there is no comprehensive understanding of this functional diversity, due to the lack of genetic tools to target and study the multitude of cell types. Here we perform two-photon imaging of GABA release in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina using the newly developed GABA sensor iGABASnFR2. By applying varied light stimuli to isolated retinae, we reveal over 40 different GABA-releasing neurons, including some not previously described. Individual types show unique distributions of synaptic release sites in the sublayers comprising the IPL, allowing layer-specific visual encoding. Synaptic input and output sites are aligned along specific retinal orientations for multiple neuronal types. Furthermore, computational modeling reveals that the combination of cell type-specific spatial structure and unique release kinetics enables inhibitory neurons to suppress and sculpt excitatory signals in response to a wide range of behaviorally relevant motion structures. Our high-throughput approach provides the first comprehensive physiological characterization of inhibitory signaling in the vertebrate CNS. Future applications of this method will enable interrogation of the function and dysfunction of diverse inhibitory circuits in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of translation and plasticity in the nervous system, which are processes required for learning and memory. Indeed, RBP dysfunction has been linked to a wide range of neurological disorders where cognitive impairments are a key symptom. However, the human genome encodes nearly 2,000 RBPs, many of which have yet to be characterized with regards to neurological phenotypes like associative behaviors. To address this, we used the model organism C. elegans to perform a targeted screen assessing the role of 20 conserved RBPs in learning and memory. We identified 16 associative memory regulators, eight of which are novel. Intriguingly, three novel memory regulators are in the C. elegans Y-Box (CEY) RNA-binding protein family: cey-1, cey-2, and cey-3. We determined that cey-1 is the closest ortholog to the mammalian Y-Box RNA-binding (YBX) proteins and that CEY-1 is specifically required in the nervous system for the ability to remember. Additionally, CEY-1 is a memory promoting molecule, as increasing CEY-1 only in the nervous system improves memory. We also examined human copy number variation datasets and found that copy number deletions in the human YBX1 and YBX3 may be associated with neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, which mirror our findings in C. elegans. We identified a similar association with a rare, mono-allelic YBX3 variant in individuals with neurological findings. Strikingly, introducing this predicted deleterious YBX3 variant into the endogenous cey-1 locus caused memory deficits in the worm. Our study highlights that high-throughput approaches in the worm reveal novel and conserved regulators of memory and identified a potential new source of rare neurological disease linked to RBP dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent clinical breakthroughs hold great promise for the application of psilocybin in the treatments of psychological disorders, such as depression, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psilocybin is a psychedelic whose metabolite, psilocin, is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of psilocybin on the brain are not fully illustrated, and cell type-specific and circuit effects of psilocybin are not fully understood. Here, we combined single-nucleus RNA-seq with functional assays to study the long-term effects of psilocybin on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region vulnerable to psychological disorders such as depression. We showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced long-term genetic and functional changes in neurons of the OFC, and excitatory and inhibitory neurons collectively reduced circuit activity of the brain region. Knockdown of 5-HT2A receptor in deep layer excitatory neurons abated psilocybin-induced functional changes and the anti-depressant effect. Together, these results showed the cell type-specific mechanisms of psilocybin and shed light on the brain region difference in the effect of psychedelics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. Here, we present the &#34;Apollo Implant&#34;, an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a &#34;payload&#34; module that is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a &#34;docking&#34; module that is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across seven labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The manner in which neural activity unfolds over time is thought to be central to sensory, motor, and cognitive functions in the brain. Network models have long posited that the brains computations involve time courses of activity that are shaped by the underlying network. A prediction from this view is that the activity time courses should be difficult to violate. We leveraged a brain-computer interface (BCI) to challenge monkeys to violate the naturally-occurring time courses of neural population activity that we observed in motor cortex. This included challenging animals to traverse the natural time course of neural activity in a time-reversed manner. Animals were unable to violate the natural time courses of neural activity when directly challenged to do so. These results provide empirical support for the view that activity time courses observed in the brain indeed reflect the underlying network-level computational mechanisms that they are believed to implement.</p>
