S.; Bautista, D. M.\nScore: 51.7, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575114\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.\nExtracting interpretable signatures of whole-brain dynamics through systematic comparison\nAuthors: Bryant, A. G.; Aquino, K.; Parkes, L.; Fornito, A.; Fulcher, B. D.\nScore: 44.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.573372\nDespite a rich and interdisciplinary literature on time-series analysis, the brains complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using only a limited set of manually selected representations and statistics. This leaves open the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here we address this limitation by introducing a systematic procedure to compare diverse, interpretable features of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, drawn from comprehensive algorithmic libraries to capture both dynamical properties of individual brain regions (intra-regional activity) and patterns of statistical dependence between regions (inter-regional functional coupling). We apply our data-driven approach to investigate alterations to dynamical structures in resting-state fMRI in participants with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar 1 disorder (BP), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our findings broadly support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for fMRI-based case-control analysis, while also identifying novel informative dynamical structures that have previously received less attention. While some simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics perform surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), we found performance improvements through combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling--consistent with distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The data-driven approach here enables the systematic identification and interpretation of disorder-specific dynamical signatures, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.\nDiverse GABA signaling in the inner retina enables spatiotemporal coding\nAuthors: Matsumoto, A.; Morris, J.; Looger, L. L.; Yonehara, K.\nScore: 29.3, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574952\nSummary paragraphGABA ({psi}-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) 1,2. There is a wide range of GABAergic neuronal types, each of which plays an important role in neural processing and the etiology of neurological disorders 3-5. However, there is no comprehensive understanding of this functional diversity, due to the lack of genetic tools to target and study the multitude of cell types. Here we perform two-photon imaging of GABA release in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina using the newly developed GABA sensor iGABASnFR2. By applying varied light stimuli to isolated retinae, we reveal over 40 different GABA-releasing neurons, including some not previously described. Individual types show unique distributions of synaptic release sites in the sublayers comprising the IPL, allowing layer-specific visual encoding. Synaptic input and output sites are aligned along specific retinal orientations for multiple neuronal types. Furthermore, computational modeling reveals that the combination of cell type-specific spatial structure and unique release kinetics enables inhibitory neurons to suppress and sculpt excitatory signals in response to a wide range of behaviorally relevant motion structures. Our high-throughput approach provides the first comprehensive physiological characterization of inhibitory signaling in the vertebrate CNS. Future applications of this method will enable interrogation of the function and dysfunction of diverse inhibitory circuits in health and disease.\nThrough the lens of causal inference: Decisions and pitfalls of covariate selection\nAuthors: Chen, G.; Cai, Z.; Taylor, P. A.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575211\nThe critical importance of justifying the inclusion of covariates is a facet often overlooked in data analysis. While the incorporation of covariates typically follows informal guidelines, we argue for a comprehensive exploration of underlying principles to avoid significant statistical and interpretational challenges. Our focus is on addressing three common yet problematic practices: the indiscriminate lumping of covariates, the lack of rationale for covariate inclusion, and the oversight of potential issues in result reporting. These challenges, prevalent in neuroimaging models involving covariates such as reaction time, demographics, and morphometric measures, can introduce biases, including overestimation, underestimation, masking, sign flipping, or spurious effects. Our exploration of causal inference principles underscores the pivotal role of domain knowledge in guiding covariate selection, challenging the common reliance on statistical measures. This understanding carries implications for experimental design, model-building, and result interpretation. We draw connections between these insights and reproducibility concerns, specifically addressing the selection bias resulting from the widespread practice of strict thresholding, akin to the logical pitfall associated with \"double dipping.\" Recommendations for robust data analysis involving covariates encompass explicit research question statements, justified covariate inclusions/exclusions, centering quantitative variables for interpretability, appropriate reporting of effect estimates, and advocating a \"highlight, don't hide\" approach in result reporting. These suggestions are intended to enhance the robustness, transparency, and reproducibility of covariate-driven analyses, encompassing investigations involving consortium datasets such as ABCD and UK Biobank. We discuss how researchers can use a transparent depiction of the covariate relationships to enhance the ethos of open science and promote research reproducibility.\nActivity-dependent expression of Fezf2 regulates inhibitory synapse formation in pyramidal cells\nAuthors: Kroon, T.; Sanalidou, S.; Maeso, P.; Garces, T.; Yang, H.; Rico, B.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575171\nThe function of the cerebral cortex relies on the precise integration of diverse neuronal populations during development, which is regulated by dynamic fine-tuning mechanisms maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition. For instance, the development of excitatory pyramidal cells is simultaneously and precisely counterbalanced by the formation of inhibitory synapses during the maturation of neuronal circuits. Although this process relies on neuronal activity, different types of pyramidal cells likely respond to changes in activity through the expression of cell-specific genes. However, the molecular programs underlying the activity-dependent recruitment of inhibition by distinct types of pyramidal cells in the neocortex are unknown. Here, we combined neuronal activity manipulation with ribosome-associated mRNA profiling of layer 5 (L5) extra-telencephalic (ET) cells to address this question in mice. We unveiled a novel function for the selector gene Fezf2 as an activity-dependent transcription factor controlling the parvalbumin inputs onto L5 ET neurons. One of the downstream effectors of FEZF2 shaping the formation of inhibitory synapses onto L5 ET pyramidal cells is the cell-surface molecule cadherin 22. Our study identifies activity-dependent factors regulating the cell type-specific assembly of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal cells.\nPrefrontal cortical dynorphin peptidergic transmission constrains threat-driven behavioral and network states\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Flores, R.

E.; Kim, Y.; Deisseroth, K.; Or, G.; Dong, C.; Hoon, M. A.; Tian, L.; Tejeda, H. A.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574700\nPrefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits provide top-down control of threat reactivity. This includes ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) circuitry, which plays a role in suppressing fear-related behavioral states. Dynorphin (Dyn) has been implicated in mediating negative affect and mal-adaptive behaviors induced by severe threats and is expressed in limbic circuits, including the vmPFC. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of how vmPFC Dyn-expressing neurons and Dyn transmission detect threats and regulate expression of defensive behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that Dyn cells are broadly activated by threats and release Dyn locally in the vmPFC to limit passive defensive behaviors. We further demonstrate that vmPFC Dyn-mediated signaling promotes a switch of vmPFC networks to a fear-related state. In conclusion, we reveal a previously unknown role of vmPFC Dyn neurons and Dyn neuropeptidergic transmission in suppressing defensive behaviors in response to threats via state-driven changes in vmPFC networks.

Recent publications in both mice and humans demonstrate that subcortical areas including hippocampus and striatum can be targeted using TI. However, whereas TI stimulation is set to be focused on a specific region of interest, other off-target areas may still be stimulated, including cortical structures. This is a major concern as off-target stimulation carries the risk of modulating unwanted brain structures and circuits. In the present study, we focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice and developed a computational modelling approach to identify the best electrode locations for targeting PFC. Using in-vivo electrophysiological recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with TI, we confirmed the presence of induced TI fields and hemodynamic responses in the PFC but also identified off-target stimulated sites. To minimize the occurrence of off-target effects, we propose a new configuration with three electrode pairs, one of which has an active phase shift of 180 degrees in relation to the other two TI-inducing pairs. The use of this phase-canceling field allowed us to improve the focality of TI by reducing off-target stimulations without significantly affecting the TI field in the target area. The proposed design effectively addresses one of TIs most critical shortcomings and opens new avenues for applications.

P.; Yimer, E. D.; Dani, N.; Shipley, F. B.; Libermann, T. A.; Lehtinen, M. K.\nScore: 46.6, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574486\nWe discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brain's ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.\nAn adaptable, reusable, and light implant for chronic Neuropixels probes\nAuthors: Bimbard, C.; Takacs, F.; Catarino, J.

D.; Kullmann, D. M.; Lignani, G.; Mainen, Z. F.; Margrie, T. W.; Rochefort, N. L.; Wikenheiser, A. M.; Carandini, M.; Coen, P.\nScore: 45.0, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551752\nElectrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. Here, we present the \"Apollo Implant\", an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a \"payload\" module that is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a \"docking\" module that is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across seven labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.\nSynaptic Theory of Working Memory for Serial Order\nAuthors: Mongillo, G.; Tsodyks, M.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575157\nWorking Memory (WM) enables the temporally-ordered maintenance of sequences of stimuli over short periods of time. This ability is critical for many cognitive and behavioral tasks. Despite its importance, however, how WM encodes, stores and retrieves information about serial order remains a major outstanding problem. Here, we extend our previously-proposed synaptic theory of WM to include synaptic augmentation, as experimentally observed at the same synapses that feature short-term facilitation. We find that synaptic augmentation leads to the emergence of a primacy gradient that can be used to reconstruct the order of presentation at recall, by an appropriate control of the background input to the WM network. The model reproduces prominent features of the behavior of human subjects recalling lists of items and makes a series of experimentally-testable predictions. Intriguingly, the model suggests that WM capacity limitations could result from a failure in retrieving, rather than encoding, information.\n",

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite a rich and interdisciplinary literature on time-series analysis, the brains complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using only a limited set of manually selected representations and statistics. This leaves open the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here we address this limitation by introducing a systematic procedure to compare diverse, interpretable features of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, drawn from comprehensive algorithmic libraries to capture both dynamical properties of individual brain regions (intra-regional activity) and patterns of statistical dependence between regions (inter-regional functional coupling). We apply our data-driven approach to investigate alterations to dynamical structures in resting-state fMRI in participants with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar 1 disorder (BP), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our findings broadly support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for fMRI-based case-control analysis, while also identifying novel informative dynamical structures that have previously received less attention. While some simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics perform surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), we found performance improvements through combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling--consistent with distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The data-driven approach here enables the systematic identification and interpretation of disorder-specific dynamical signatures, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary paragraphGABA ({psi}-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) 1,2. There is a wide range of GABAergic neuronal types, each of which plays an important role in neural processing and the etiology of neurological disorders 3-5. However, there is no comprehensive understanding of this functional diversity, due to the lack of genetic tools to target and study the multitude of cell types. Here we perform two-photon imaging of GABA release in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina using the newly developed GABA sensor iGABASnFR2. By applying varied light stimuli to isolated retinae, we reveal over 40 different GABA-releasing neurons, including some not previously described. Individual types show unique distributions of synaptic release sites in the sublayers comprising the IPL, allowing layer-specific visual encoding. Synaptic input and output sites are aligned along specific retinal orientations for multiple neuronal types. Furthermore, computational modeling reveals that the combination of cell type-specific spatial structure and unique release kinetics enables inhibitory neurons to suppress and sculpt excitatory signals in response to a wide range of behaviorally relevant motion structures. Our high-throughput approach provides the first comprehensive physiological characterization of inhibitory signaling in the vertebrate CNS. Future applications of this method will enable interrogation of the function and dysfunction of diverse inhibitory circuits in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The critical importance of justifying the inclusion of covariates is a facet often overlooked in data analysis. While the incorporation of covariates typically follows informal guidelines, we argue for a comprehensive exploration of underlying principles to avoid significant statistical and interpretational challenges. Our focus is on addressing three common yet problematic practices: the indiscriminate lumping of covariates, the lack of rationale for covariate inclusion, and the oversight of potential issues in result reporting. These challenges, prevalent in neuroimaging models involving covariates such as reaction time, demographics, and morphometric measures, can introduce biases, including overestimation, underestimation, masking, sign flipping, or spurious effects. Our exploration of causal inference principles underscores the pivotal role of domain knowledge in guiding covariate selection, challenging the common reliance on statistical measures. This understanding carries implications for experimental design, model-building, and result interpretation. We draw connections between these insights and reproducibility concerns, specifically addressing the selection bias resulting from the widespread practice of strict thresholding, akin to the logical pitfall associated with &#34;double dipping.&#34; Recommendations for robust data analysis involving covariates encompass explicit research question statements, justified covariate inclusions/exclusions, centering quantitative variables for interpretability, appropriate reporting of effect estimates, and advocating a &#34;highlight, don&#39;t hide&#34; approach in result reporting. These suggestions are intended to enhance the robustness, transparency, and reproducibility of covariate-driven analyses, encompassing investigations involving consortium datasets such as ABCD and UK Biobank. We discuss how researchers can use a transparent depiction of the covariate relationships to enhance the ethos of open science and promote research reproducibility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The function of the cerebral cortex relies on the precise integration of diverse neuronal populations during development, which is regulated by dynamic fine-tuning mechanisms maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition. For instance, the development of excitatory pyramidal cells is simultaneously and precisely counterbalanced by the formation of inhibitory synapses during the maturation of neuronal circuits. Although this process relies on neuronal activity, different types of pyramidal cells likely respond to changes in activity through the expression of cell-specific genes. However, the molecular programs underlying the activity-dependent recruitment of inhibition by distinct types of pyramidal cells in the neocortex are unknown. Here, we combined neuronal activity manipulation with ribosome-associated mRNA profiling of layer 5 (L5) extra-telencephalic (ET) cells to address this question in mice. We unveiled a novel function for the selector gene Fezf2 as an activity-dependent transcription factor controlling the parvalbumin inputs onto L5 ET neurons. One of the downstream effectors of FEZF2 shaping the formation of inhibitory synapses onto L5 ET pyramidal cells is the cell-surface molecule cadherin 22. Our study identifies activity-dependent factors regulating the cell type-specific assembly of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits provide top-down control of threat reactivity. This includes ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) circuitry, which plays a role in suppressing fear-related behavioral states. Dynorphin (Dyn) has been implicated in mediating negative affect and mal-adaptive behaviors induced by severe threats and is expressed in limbic circuits, including the vmPFC. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of how vmPFC Dyn-expressing neurons and Dyn transmission detect threats and regulate expression of defensive behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that Dyn cells are broadly activated by threats and release Dyn locally in the vmPFC to limit passive defensive behaviors. We further demonstrate that vmPFC Dyn-mediated signaling promotes a switch of vmPFC networks to a fear-related state. In conclusion, we reveal a previously unknown role of vmPFC Dyn neurons and Dyn neuropeptidergic transmission in suppressing defensive behaviors in response to threats via state-driven changes in vmPFC networks.

        <p class="abstract">Temporal Interference Stimulation (TI) is a novel brain stimulation technique that aims to integrate the depth characteristic of conventional deep brain stimulation protocols with the non-invasive nature of transcranial electric stimulation. Recent publications in both mice and humans demonstrate that subcortical areas including hippocampus and striatum can be targeted using TI. However, whereas TI stimulation is set to be focused on a specific region of interest, other off-target areas may still be stimulated, including cortical structures. This is a major concern as off-target stimulation carries the risk of modulating unwanted brain structures and circuits. In the present study, we focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice and developed a computational modelling approach to identify the best electrode locations for targeting PFC. Using in-vivo electrophysiological recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with TI, we confirmed the presence of induced TI fields and hemodynamic responses in the PFC but also identified off-target stimulated sites. To minimize the occurrence of off-target effects, we propose a new configuration with three electrode pairs, one of which has an active phase shift of 180 degrees in relation to the other two TI-inducing pairs. The use of this phase-canceling field allowed us to improve the focality of TI by reducing off-target stimulations without significantly affecting the TI field in the target area. The proposed design effectively addresses one of TIs most critical shortcomings and opens new avenues for applications.

        <p class="abstract">We discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brain&#39;s ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. Here, we present the &#34;Apollo Implant&#34;, an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a &#34;payload&#34; module that is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a &#34;docking&#34; module that is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across seven labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Working Memory (WM) enables the temporally-ordered maintenance of sequences of stimuli over short periods of time. This ability is critical for many cognitive and behavioral tasks. Despite its importance, however, how WM encodes, stores and retrieves information about serial order remains a major outstanding problem. Here, we extend our previously-proposed synaptic theory of WM to include synaptic augmentation, as experimentally observed at the same synapses that feature short-term facilitation. We find that synaptic augmentation leads to the emergence of a primacy gradient that can be used to reconstruct the order of presentation at recall, by an appropriate control of the background input to the WM network. The model reproduces prominent features of the behavior of human subjects recalling lists of items and makes a series of experimentally-testable predictions. Intriguingly, the model suggests that WM capacity limitations could result from a failure in retrieving, rather than encoding, information.</p>
