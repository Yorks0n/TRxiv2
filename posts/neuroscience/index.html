Both these diseases and several other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity. Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases in the wake of COVID-19.\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA Persists in the Central Nervous System of Non-Human Primates Despite Clinical Recovery\nAuthors: Li, H.; McLaurin, K. A.; Mactutus, C. F.; Rappaport, J.; Datta, P. K.; Booze, R.\nScore: 113.3, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555368\nAdverse neurological and psychiatric outcomes, collectively termed the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), persist in adults clinically recovered from COVID-19. Effective therapeutic interventions are fundamental to reducing the burden of PASC, necessitating an investigation of the pathophysiology underlying the debilitating neurological symptoms associated with the condition. Herein, eight non-human primates (Wild-Caught African Green Monkeys, n=4; Indian Rhesus Macaques, n=4) were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 by either small particle aerosol or via multiple routes. At necropsy, tissue from the olfactory epithelium and pyriform cortex/amygdala of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates were collected for ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization (i.e., RNAscope). First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) mRNA are downregulated in the pyriform cortex/amygdala of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 inoculation relative to wildtype controls. Second, abundant SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was detected in clinically recovered non-human primates; mRNA which is predominantly harbored in pericytes. Collectively, examination of post-mortem pyriform cortex/amygdala brain tissue of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed two early pathophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying PASC. Indeed, therapeutic interventions targeting the downregulation of ACE2, decreased expression of TMPRSS2, and/or persistent infection of pericytes in the central nervous system may effectively mitigate the debilitating symptoms of PASC.\nUltra-high density electrodes improve detection, yield, and cell type specificity of brain recordings\nAuthors: Ye, Z.; Shelton, A.

B.; Bair, W.; Pasupathy, A.; Mora-Lopez, C.; Dutta, B.; Paninski, L.; Siegle, J. H.; Koch, C.; Olsen, S. R.; Harris, T. D.; Steinmetz, N. A.\nScore: 112.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554527\nTo study the neural basis of behavior, we require methods to sensitively and accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at ultra-high densities (\u003e1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), with 6 {micro}m center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neurons electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves [~]3-fold. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging, we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75% success among three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.\nA general exposome factor explains individual differences in functional brain network topography and cognition in youth\nAuthors: Keller, A. S.; Moore, T. M.; Luo, A.; Visoki, E.; Gatavins, M. M.; Shetty, A.; Cui, Z.; Fan, Y.; Feczko, E.; Houghton, A.; Li, H.; Mackey, A. P.; Miranda-Dominguez, O.; Pines, A.; Shinohara, R. T.; Sun, K. Y.; Fair, D. A.; Satterthwaite, T. D.; Barzilay, R.\nScore: 40.1, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554893\nOur minds and brains are highly unique. Despite the long-recognized importance of the environment in shaping individual differences in cognitive neurodevelopment, only with the combination of deep phenotyping approaches and the availability of large-scale datasets have we been able to more comprehensively characterize the many inter-connected features of an individuals environment and experience (\"exposome\"). Moreover, despite clear evidence that brain organization is highly individualized, most neuroimaging studies still rely on group atlases to define functional networks, smearing away inter-individual variation in the spatial layout of functional networks across the cortex (\"functional topography\"). Here, we leverage the largest longitudinal study of brain and behavior development in the United States to investigate how an individuals exposome may contribute to functional brain network organization leading to differences in cognitive functioning. To do so, we apply three previously-validated data driven computational models to characterize an individuals multidimensional exposome, define individual-specific maps of functional brain networks, and measure cognitive functioning across broad domains. In pre-registered analyses replicated across matched discovery (n=5,139, 48.5% female) and replication (n=5,137, 47.1% female) samples, we find that a childs exposome is associated with multiple domains of cognitive functioning both at baseline assessment and two years later - over and above associations with baseline cognition. Cross-validated ridge regression models reveal that the exposome is reflected in childrens unique patterns of functional topography. Finally, we uncover both shared and unique contributions of the exposome and functional topography to cognitive abilities, finding that models trained on a single variable capturing a childs exposome can more accurately and parsimoniously predict future cognitive performance than models trained on a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data. This study advances our understanding of how childhood environments contribute to unique patterns of functional brain organization and variability in cognitive abilities.\nBrain-Derived CCN3 Is An Osteoanabolic Hormone That Sustains Bone in Lactating Females\nAuthors: Babey, M. E.; Krause, W. C.; Herber, C. B.; Chen, K.; Nikkannen, J.; Rodriquez, R.; Zhang, X.; Castro-Navarro, F.; Wang, Y.; Villeda, S.; Lane, N. E.; Scheller, E. L.; Chan, C. K. F.; Ambrosi, T. H.; Ingraham, H. A.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554707\nIn lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2+) demand for milk production triggers significant bone resorption. While estrogen would normally counteract excessive bone loss and maintain sufficient bone formation during this postpartum period, this sex steroid drops precipitously after giving birth. Here, we report that brain-derived CCN3 (Cellular Communication Network factor 3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. Using parabiosis and bone transplant methods, we first established that a humoral factor accounts for the female-specific, high bone mass previously observed by our group after deleting estrogen receptor alpha (ER) from ARCKISS1 neurons1. This exceptional bone phenotype in mutant females can be traced back to skeletal stem cells (SSCs), as reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from ARCKISS1 neurons, acting on mouse and human SSCs at low subnanomolar concentrations independent of age or sex. That brain-derived CCN3 promotes bone formation was further confirmed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies. Notably, a transient rise in CCN3 appears in ARCKISS1 neurons in estrogen-depleted lactating females coincident with increased bone remodeling and high calcium demand. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone that defines a novel female-specific brain-bone axis for ensuring mammalian species survival.\nComparative neuroimaging of sex differences in human and mouse brain anatomy\nAuthors: Guma, E.; Beauchamp, A.; Liu, S.; Levitis, E.; Ellegood, J.; Pham, L.; Mars, R. B.; Raznahan, A.; Lerch, J. P.\nScore: 29.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554334\nIn vivo neuroimaging studies have established several reproducible volumetric sex differences in the human brain, but the causes of such differences are hard to parse. While mouse models are useful for understanding the cellular and mechanistic bases of sex-biased brain development in mammals, there have been no attempts to formally compare mouse and human sex differences across the whole brain to ascertain how well they translate. Addressing this question would shed critical light on use of the mouse as a translational model for sex differences in the human brain and provide insights into the degree to which sex differences in brain volume are conserved across mammals. Here, we use cross-species structural magnetic resonance imaging to carry out the first comparative neuroimaging study of sex-biased neuroanatomical organization of the human and mouse brain. In line with previous findings, we observe that in humans, males have significantly larger and more variable total brain volume; these sex differences are not mirrored in mice. After controlling for total brain volume, we observe modest cross-species congruence in the volumetric effect size of sex across 60 homologous brain regions (r=0.30; e.g.: M\u003eF amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hypothalamus and F\u003eM anterior cingulate, somatosensory, and primary auditory cortices). This cross-species congruence is greater in the cortex (r=0.33) than non-cortex (r=0.16). By incorporating regional measures of gene expression in both species, we reveal that cortical regions with greater cross-species congruence in volumetric sex differences also show greater cross-species congruence in the expression profile of 2835 homologous genes. This phenomenon differentiates primary sensory regions with high congruence of sex effects and gene expression from limbic cortices where congruence in both these features was weaker between species. These findings help identify aspects of sex-biased brain anatomy present in mice that are retained, lost, or inverted in humans. More broadly, our work provides an empirical basis for targeting mechanistic studies of sex-biased brain development in mice to brain regions that best echo sex-biased brain development in humans.\nD--hydroxybutyrate stabilizes the hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit during acute insulin resistance.\nAuthors: Kula, B.; Antal, B.; Weistuch, C.; Gackiere, F.; Barre, A.; Velado, V.; Hubbard, J. M.; Kukley, M.; Mujica-Parodi, L. R.; Smith, N. A.\nScore: 33.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554428\nThe brain primarily relies on glycolysis for mitochondrial respiration but switches to alternative fuels such as ketone bodies (KB) during low glucose availability. Neuronal KB uptake, which does not rely on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and insulin, has shown promising clinical applications in alleviating the neurological and cognitive effects of disorders with hypometabolic components. However, the specific mechanisms by which such interventions affect neuronal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we pharmacologically blocked GLUT4 to investigate the effects of the exogenous KB D-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (D-{beta}Hb) on mouse brain metabolism during acute insulin resistance (AIR). We found the impacts of AIR and D-{beta}Hb to be qualitatively distinct across neuronal compartments: AIR decreased synaptic activity and LTP, and impaired axonal conduction, synchronization, and action potential (AP) properties. D-{beta}Hb rescued neuronal functions connected to axonal conduction and synchronization but did not rescue synaptic activity. While D-{beta}HB failed to rescue synaptic activity, it successfully rescued neuronal functions associated with axonal conduction and synchronization. Teaser: D-{beta}Hb reverses detrimental effects of acute insulin resistance in the hippocampus, with distinct effects on soma, dendrites, and axons.\nPrenatal environment is associated with the pace of cortical network development over the first three years of life\nAuthors: Tooley, U.; Latham, A.; Kenley, J. K.; Alexopoulos, D.; Smyser, T.; Warner, B. B.; Shimony, J. S.; Neil, J. J.; Luby, J. L.; Barch, D. M.; Rogers, C. E.; Smyser, C. D.\nScore: 25.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.552639\nEnvironmental influences on brain structure and function during early development have been well-characterized. In pre-registered analyses, we test the theory that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with differences in trajectories of intrinsic brain network development from birth to three years (n = 261). Prenatal SES is associated with developmental increases in cortical network segregation, with neonates and toddlers from lower-SES backgrounds showing a steeper increase in cortical network segregation with age, consistent with accelerated network development. Associations between SES and cortical network segregation occur at the local scale and conform to a sensorimotor-association hierarchy of cortical organization. SES-associated differences in cortical network segregation are associated with language abilities at two years, such that lower segregation is associated with improved language abilities. These results yield key insight into the timing and directionality of associations between the early environment and trajectories of cortical development.\nTranslocation of gut commensal bacteria to the brain\nAuthors: Thapa, M.; Kumari, A.; Chin, C.-Y.; Choby, J.; Jin, F.; Bogati, B.; Chopyk, D.; Koduri, N.; Pahnke, A.; Elrod, E.; Burd, E. M.; Weiss, D. S.; Grakoui, A.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555630\nThe gut-brain axis, a bidirectional signaling network between the intestine and the central nervous system, is crucial to the regulation of host physiology and inflammation. Recent advances suggest a strong correlation between gut dysbiosis and neurological diseases, however, relatively little is known about how gut bacteria impact the brain. Here, we reveal that gut commensal bacteria can translocate directly to the brain when mice are fed an altered diet that causes dysbiosis and intestinal permeability, and that this also occurs without diet alteration in distinct murine models of neurological disease. The bacteria were not found in other systemic sites or the blood, but were detected in the vagus nerve. Unilateral cervical vagotomy significantly reduced the number of bacteria in the brain, implicating the vagus nerve as a conduit for translocation. The presence of bacteria in the brain correlated with microglial activation, a marker of neuroinflammation, and with neural protein aggregation, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In at least one model, the presence of bacteria in the brain was reversible as a switch from high-fat to standard diet resulted in amelioration of intestinal permeability, led to a gradual loss of detectable bacteria in the brain, and reduced the number of neural protein aggregates. Further, in murine models of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and autism spectrum disorder, we observed gut dysbiosis, gut leakiness, bacterial translocation to the brain, and microglial activation. These data reveal a commensal bacterial translocation axis to the brain in models of diverse neurological diseases.\nCryo-EM structures of Tau filaments from the brains of mice transgenic for human mutant P301S Tau\nAuthors: Schweighauser, M.; Murzin, A. G.; McDonald, J.; Lavenir, I. L.; Crowther, R. A.; Scheres, S.; Goedert, M.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555656\nMice transgenic for human mutant P301S tau are widely used as models for human tauopathies. They develop neurodegeneration and abundant filamentous inclusions made of human mutant four-repeat tau. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments from the brains of Tg2541 and PS19 mice. Both lines express human P301S tau (0N4R for Tg2541 and 1N4R for PS19) on mixed genetic backgrounds and downstream of different promoters (murine Thy1 for Tg2541 and murine Prnp for PS19). The structures of tau filaments from Tg2541 and PS19 mice differ from each other and those of tau filaments from human brains. However, they share a substructure at the junction of repeats 2 and 3, which comprises residues I297-V312 of tau and includes the P301S mutation. The filament core from the brainstem of Tg2541 mice consists of residues K274-H329 of tau and two disconnected protein densities. Two non-proteinaceous densities are also in evidence. The filament core from the cerebral cortex of line PS19 extends from residues G271-P364 of tau. One strong non- proteinaceous density is also present. Unlike the tau filaments from human brains, the sequences following repeat 4 are missing from the cores of tau filaments from the brains of Tg2541 and PS19 mice.\n",

        <p class="abstract">An increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity. Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adverse neurological and psychiatric outcomes, collectively termed the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), persist in adults clinically recovered from COVID-19. Effective therapeutic interventions are fundamental to reducing the burden of PASC, necessitating an investigation of the pathophysiology underlying the debilitating neurological symptoms associated with the condition. Herein, eight non-human primates (Wild-Caught African Green Monkeys, n=4; Indian Rhesus Macaques, n=4) were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 by either small particle aerosol or via multiple routes. At necropsy, tissue from the olfactory epithelium and pyriform cortex/amygdala of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates were collected for ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization (i.e., RNAscope). First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) mRNA are downregulated in the pyriform cortex/amygdala of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 inoculation relative to wildtype controls. Second, abundant SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was detected in clinically recovered non-human primates; mRNA which is predominantly harbored in pericytes. Collectively, examination of post-mortem pyriform cortex/amygdala brain tissue of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed two early pathophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying PASC. Indeed, therapeutic interventions targeting the downregulation of ACE2, decreased expression of TMPRSS2, and/or persistent infection of pericytes in the central nervous system may effectively mitigate the debilitating symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To study the neural basis of behavior, we require methods to sensitively and accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at ultra-high densities (&gt;1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), with 6 {micro}m center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neurons electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves [~]3-fold. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging, we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75% success among three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our minds and brains are highly unique. Despite the long-recognized importance of the environment in shaping individual differences in cognitive neurodevelopment, only with the combination of deep phenotyping approaches and the availability of large-scale datasets have we been able to more comprehensively characterize the many inter-connected features of an individuals environment and experience (&#34;exposome&#34;). Moreover, despite clear evidence that brain organization is highly individualized, most neuroimaging studies still rely on group atlases to define functional networks, smearing away inter-individual variation in the spatial layout of functional networks across the cortex (&#34;functional topography&#34;). Here, we leverage the largest longitudinal study of brain and behavior development in the United States to investigate how an individuals exposome may contribute to functional brain network organization leading to differences in cognitive functioning. To do so, we apply three previously-validated data driven computational models to characterize an individuals multidimensional exposome, define individual-specific maps of functional brain networks, and measure cognitive functioning across broad domains. In pre-registered analyses replicated across matched discovery (n=5,139, 48.5% female) and replication (n=5,137, 47.1% female) samples, we find that a childs exposome is associated with multiple domains of cognitive functioning both at baseline assessment and two years later - over and above associations with baseline cognition. Cross-validated ridge regression models reveal that the exposome is reflected in childrens unique patterns of functional topography. Finally, we uncover both shared and unique contributions of the exposome and functional topography to cognitive abilities, finding that models trained on a single variable capturing a childs exposome can more accurately and parsimoniously predict future cognitive performance than models trained on a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data. This study advances our understanding of how childhood environments contribute to unique patterns of functional brain organization and variability in cognitive abilities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2&#43;) demand for milk production triggers significant bone resorption. While estrogen would normally counteract excessive bone loss and maintain sufficient bone formation during this postpartum period, this sex steroid drops precipitously after giving birth. Here, we report that brain-derived CCN3 (Cellular Communication Network factor 3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. Using parabiosis and bone transplant methods, we first established that a humoral factor accounts for the female-specific, high bone mass previously observed by our group after deleting estrogen receptor alpha (ER) from ARCKISS1 neurons1. This exceptional bone phenotype in mutant females can be traced back to skeletal stem cells (SSCs), as reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from ARCKISS1 neurons, acting on mouse and human SSCs at low subnanomolar concentrations independent of age or sex. That brain-derived CCN3 promotes bone formation was further confirmed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies. Notably, a transient rise in CCN3 appears in ARCKISS1 neurons in estrogen-depleted lactating females coincident with increased bone remodeling and high calcium demand. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone that defines a novel female-specific brain-bone axis for ensuring mammalian species survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vivo neuroimaging studies have established several reproducible volumetric sex differences in the human brain, but the causes of such differences are hard to parse. While mouse models are useful for understanding the cellular and mechanistic bases of sex-biased brain development in mammals, there have been no attempts to formally compare mouse and human sex differences across the whole brain to ascertain how well they translate. Addressing this question would shed critical light on use of the mouse as a translational model for sex differences in the human brain and provide insights into the degree to which sex differences in brain volume are conserved across mammals. Here, we use cross-species structural magnetic resonance imaging to carry out the first comparative neuroimaging study of sex-biased neuroanatomical organization of the human and mouse brain. In line with previous findings, we observe that in humans, males have significantly larger and more variable total brain volume; these sex differences are not mirrored in mice. After controlling for total brain volume, we observe modest cross-species congruence in the volumetric effect size of sex across 60 homologous brain regions (r=0.30; e.g.: M&gt;F amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hypothalamus and F&gt;M anterior cingulate, somatosensory, and primary auditory cortices). This cross-species congruence is greater in the cortex (r=0.33) than non-cortex (r=0.16). By incorporating regional measures of gene expression in both species, we reveal that cortical regions with greater cross-species congruence in volumetric sex differences also show greater cross-species congruence in the expression profile of 2835 homologous genes. This phenomenon differentiates primary sensory regions with high congruence of sex effects and gene expression from limbic cortices where congruence in both these features was weaker between species. These findings help identify aspects of sex-biased brain anatomy present in mice that are retained, lost, or inverted in humans. More broadly, our work provides an empirical basis for targeting mechanistic studies of sex-biased brain development in mice to brain regions that best echo sex-biased brain development in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brain primarily relies on glycolysis for mitochondrial respiration but switches to alternative fuels such as ketone bodies (KB) during low glucose availability. Neuronal KB uptake, which does not rely on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and insulin, has shown promising clinical applications in alleviating the neurological and cognitive effects of disorders with hypometabolic components. However, the specific mechanisms by which such interventions affect neuronal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we pharmacologically blocked GLUT4 to investigate the effects of the exogenous KB D-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (D-{beta}Hb) on mouse brain metabolism during acute insulin resistance (AIR). We found the impacts of AIR and D-{beta}Hb to be qualitatively distinct across neuronal compartments: AIR decreased synaptic activity and LTP, and impaired axonal conduction, synchronization, and action potential (AP) properties. D-{beta}Hb rescued neuronal functions connected to axonal conduction and synchronization but did not rescue synaptic activity. While D-{beta}HB failed to rescue synaptic activity, it successfully rescued neuronal functions associated with axonal conduction and synchronization.

Teaser: D-{beta}Hb reverses detrimental effects of acute insulin resistance in the hippocampus, with distinct effects on soma, dendrites, and axons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental influences on brain structure and function during early development have been well-characterized. In pre-registered analyses, we test the theory that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with differences in trajectories of intrinsic brain network development from birth to three years (n = 261). Prenatal SES is associated with developmental increases in cortical network segregation, with neonates and toddlers from lower-SES backgrounds showing a steeper increase in cortical network segregation with age, consistent with accelerated network development. Associations between SES and cortical network segregation occur at the local scale and conform to a sensorimotor-association hierarchy of cortical organization. SES-associated differences in cortical network segregation are associated with language abilities at two years, such that lower segregation is associated with improved language abilities. These results yield key insight into the timing and directionality of associations between the early environment and trajectories of cortical development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional signaling network between the intestine and the central nervous system, is crucial to the regulation of host physiology and inflammation. Recent advances suggest a strong correlation between gut dysbiosis and neurological diseases, however, relatively little is known about how gut bacteria impact the brain. Here, we reveal that gut commensal bacteria can translocate directly to the brain when mice are fed an altered diet that causes dysbiosis and intestinal permeability, and that this also occurs without diet alteration in distinct murine models of neurological disease. The bacteria were not found in other systemic sites or the blood, but were detected in the vagus nerve. Unilateral cervical vagotomy significantly reduced the number of bacteria in the brain, implicating the vagus nerve as a conduit for translocation. The presence of bacteria in the brain correlated with microglial activation, a marker of neuroinflammation, and with neural protein aggregation, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In at least one model, the presence of bacteria in the brain was reversible as a switch from high-fat to standard diet resulted in amelioration of intestinal permeability, led to a gradual loss of detectable bacteria in the brain, and reduced the number of neural protein aggregates. Further, in murine models of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and autism spectrum disorder, we observed gut dysbiosis, gut leakiness, bacterial translocation to the brain, and microglial activation. These data reveal a commensal bacterial translocation axis to the brain in models of diverse neurological diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mice transgenic for human mutant P301S tau are widely used as models for human tauopathies. They develop neurodegeneration and abundant filamentous inclusions made of human mutant four-repeat tau. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments from the brains of Tg2541 and PS19 mice. Both lines express human P301S tau (0N4R for Tg2541 and 1N4R for PS19) on mixed genetic backgrounds and downstream of different promoters (murine Thy1 for Tg2541 and murine Prnp for PS19). The structures of tau filaments from Tg2541 and PS19 mice differ from each other and those of tau filaments from human brains. However, they share a substructure at the junction of repeats 2 and 3, which comprises residues I297-V312 of tau and includes the P301S mutation. The filament core from the brainstem of Tg2541 mice consists of residues K274-H329 of tau and two disconnected protein densities. Two non-proteinaceous densities are also in evidence. The filament core from the cerebral cortex of line PS19 extends from residues G271-P364 of tau. One strong non- proteinaceous density is also present. Unlike the tau filaments from human brains, the sequences following repeat 4 are missing from the cores of tau filaments from the brains of Tg2541 and PS19 mice.</p>
