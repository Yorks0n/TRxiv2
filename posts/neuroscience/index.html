Here we examined the mechanisms for biased value learning using reinforcement learning models incorporating recent findings on synaptic plasticity and opponent circuit mechanisms in the basal ganglia. We show that variations in tonic dopamine can alter the balance between learning from positive and negative reward prediction errors, leading to biased value predictions. This bias arises from the sigmoidal shapes of the dose-occupancy curves and distinct affinities of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors: changes in tonic dopamine differentially alters the slope of the dose-occupancy curves of these receptors, thus sensitivities, at baseline dopamine concentrations. We show that this mechanism can explain biased value learning in both mice and humans and may also contribute to symptoms observed in psychiatric disorders. Our model provides a foundation for understanding the basal ganglia circuit and underscores the significance of tonic dopamine in modulating learning processes.\nGenetic, transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analysis of progressive supranuclear palsy implicates glial activation and novel risk genes\nAuthors: Farrell, K.; Humphrey, J.; Chang, T.; Zhao, Y.; Leung, Y.

H.;\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.565552\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare Parkinsonian disorder characterized by problems with movement, balance, cognition, and other symptoms. PSP differs from Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases displaying abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (\"tauopathies\") by the presence of pathology not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences, however much of PSP genetics remains unexplained. Here we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP to date including 2,779 cases (2,595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5,584 controls and identified six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (p \u003c 5x10-8) associations including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations revealed a unique oligodendrocytic signature that distinguishes PSP from AD and Parkinsons disease. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identified oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, as well as an association with elevated C4A expression in bulk brain tissue which may be driven by increased C4A copy number in PSP cases. Finally, histological studies demonstrated abnormal tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies including epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identified potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in the pathogenesis of PSP.\nPain persists in mice lacking both Substance P and CGRPα signaling\nAuthors: MacDonald, D. I.; Jayabalan, M.; Seaman, J. T.; Nickolls, A. R.; Chesler, A. T.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567208\nThe neuropeptides Substance P and CGRP have long been thought important for pain sensation. Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRP are extensively co-expressed we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated Tac1 and Calca double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRP peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRP are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.\nEngineered odorant receptors illuminate structural principles of odor discrimination\nAuthors: de March, C.

Vertebrate animals perceive odors via G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs). In humans, [~]400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family is composed of two major classes: Class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids while Class II ORs, representing the vast majority of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants. How ORs recognize chemically diverse odorants remains poorly understood. A fundamental bottleneck is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here, we uncover fundamental molecular properties of odorant-OR interactions by employing engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modeling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled four cryoEM structures of distinct consORs with unique ligand recognition properties. The structure of a Class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and yielded a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three Class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between Class I and Class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.\nCriticality of resting-state EEG predicts perturbational complexity and level of consciousness during anesthesia\nAuthors: Maschke, C.; O'Byrne, J.; Colombo, M. A.; Boly, M.; Gosseries, O.; Laureys, S.; Rosanova, M.; Jerbi, K.; Blain-Moraes, S.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564247\n1Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigated dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. We then studied the relation of these dynamic properties with the perturbational complexity index (PCI), which has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independent of behavior. All participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams)., enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. We estimated (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related measures, and found that states of unconsciousness were characterized by a distancing from both the edge of activity propagation and the edge of chaos. We were then able to predict individual subjects PCI (i.e., PCImax) with a mean absolute error below 7%. Our results establish a firm link between the PCI and criticality and provide further evidence for the role of criticality in the emergence of consciousness. 2 Significance StatementComplexity has long been of interest in consciousness science and had a fundamental impact on many of todays theories of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) uses the complexity of the brains response to cortical perturbations to quantify the presence of consciousness. We propose criticality as a unifying framework underlying maximal complexity and sensitivity to perturbation in the conscious brain. We demonstrate that criticality measures derived from resting-state electroencephalography can distinguish conscious from unconscious states, using propofol, xenon and ketamine anesthesia, and from these measures we were able to predict the PCI with a mean error below 7%. Our results support the hypothesis that critical brain dynamics are implicated in the emergence of consciousness and may provide new directions for the assessment of consciousness.\nXCP-D: A Robust Pipeline for the post-processing of fMRI data\nAuthors: Mehta, K.

D.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567926\nFunctional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded \u003e3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.\nFunctional brain networks are associated with both sex and gender in children\nAuthors: Dhamala, E.; Bassett, D.; Yeo, B. T. T.; Holmes, A.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566592\nSex and gender are associated with human behavior throughout the lifespan and across health and disease, but whether they are associated with similar or distinct neural phenotypes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in children, sex and gender are uniquely reflected in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain. Unimodal networks are more strongly associated with sex while heteromodal networks are more strongly associated with gender. These results suggest sex and gender are irreducible to one another not only in society but also in biology.\nMultivariate links between the developmental timing of adversity exposure and white matter tract integrity in adulthood\nAuthors: Sisk, L.

G.\nScore: 24.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566271\nEarly-life adversity is pervasive worldwide and represents a potent risk factor for increased mental health burden across the lifespan. However, there is substantial individual heterogeneity in associations between adversity exposure, neurobiological changes, and mental health problems. Accounting for key features of adversity such as the developmental timing of exposure may clarify associations between adversity, neurodevelopment, and mental health. The present study leverages sparse canonical correlation analysis to characterize modes of covariation between age of adversity exposure and the integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain in a sample of 107 adults. We find that adversity exposure during middle childhood (ages 5-6 and 8-9 in particular) is consistently linked with alterations in white matter tract integrity, such that tracts supporting sensorimotor functions display higher integrity in relation to adversity exposure while tracts supporting cortico-cortical communication display lower integrity. Further, latent patterns of tract integrity linked with adversity experienced across preschool age and middle childhood (ages 4-9) were associated with trauma-related symptoms in adulthood. Our findings underscore that adversity exposure may differentially affect white matter in a function- and developmental-timing specific manner and suggest that adversity experienced between ages 4-9 may shape the development of global white matter tracts in ways that are relevant for adult mental health.\nA shared spatial topography links the functional connectome correlates of cocaine use disorder and dopamine D2/3 receptor densities\nAuthors: Ricard, J. A.; Labache, L.; Segal, A.; Dhamala, E.; Cocuzza, C. V.; Jones, G.; Yip, S.; Chopra, S.; Holmes, A. J.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567591\nBackground: The biological mechanisms that contribute to cocaine and other substance use disorders involve an array of cortical and subcortical systems. Prior work on the development and maintenance of substance use has largely focused on cortico-striatal circuits, with relatively less attention on alterations within and across large-scale functional brain networks, and associated aspects of the dopamine system. The brain-wide pattern of temporal co-activation between distinct brain regions, referred to as the functional connectome, underpins individual differences in behavior. Critically, the functional connectome correlates of substance use and their specificity to dopamine receptor densities relative to other metabotropic receptors classes remains to be established. Methods: We comprehensively characterized brain-wide differences in functional connectivity across multiple scales, including individual connections, regions, and networks in participants with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n=69) and healthy matched controls (n=62), Further, we studied the relationship between the observed functional connectivity signatures of CUD and the spatial distribution of a broad range of normative neurotransmitter receptor and transporter bindings as assessed through 18 different normative positron emission tomography (PET) maps. Results: Our analyses identified a widespread profile of functional connectivity differences between individuals with CUD and matched healthy comparison participants (8.8% of total edges; 8,185 edges; pFWE=0.025). We largely find lower connectivity preferentially linking default network and subcortical regions, and higher within-network connectivity in the default network in participants with CUD. Furthermore, we find consistent and replicable associations between signatures of CUD and normative spatial density of dopamine D2/3 receptors. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed a widespread profile of altered connectivity in individuals with CUD that extends across the functional connectome and implicates multiple circuits. This profile is robustly coupled with normative dopamine D2/3 receptors densities. Underscoring the translational potential of connectomic approaches for the study of in vivo brain functions, CUD-linked aspects of brain function were spatially coupled to disorder relevant neurotransmitter systems.\nUsing cluster-based permutation tests to estimate MEG/EEG onsets: how bad is it?\nAuthors: Rousselet, G. A.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566864\nLocalising effects in space, time and other dimensions is a fundamental goal of magneto- and electro-encephalography research. A popular exploratory approach applies mass-univariate statistics that are corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster inferences, by pooling together neighbouring effects. However, these cluster-based methods have an important limitation: because the inference is at the cluster level, there is no explicit localisation, and one must be cautious about interpreting when and where effects start and end. Sassenhagen \u0026 Draschkow (2019) provided an important reminder of this limitation. They also reported results from a simulation, suggesting that estimated onsets are both positively biased and underestimate real onsets in a large proportion of simulated experiments. However, the simulation did not provide results from other methods as a comparison. Using a new simulation, here I demonstrate that cluster-based inferences perform well relative to other standard methods that provide p values at every testing point: correcting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate adjustment leads to higher underestimation, while a maximum statistic leads to higher overestimation. Researchers using cluster-based inferences will report more accurate onset estimates in the long run than if they use these alternative methods. It is also worth keeping in mind that all common approaches to infer effect onsets rely on a statistical fallacy, because they never explicitly test the implied interaction between statistically significant and non-significant points. Better approaches to onset estimation can be implemented, for instance using change point detection algorithms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of various psychiatric disorders is biased future predictions. Here we examined the mechanisms for biased value learning using reinforcement learning models incorporating recent findings on synaptic plasticity and opponent circuit mechanisms in the basal ganglia. We show that variations in tonic dopamine can alter the balance between learning from positive and negative reward prediction errors, leading to biased value predictions. This bias arises from the sigmoidal shapes of the dose-occupancy curves and distinct affinities of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors: changes in tonic dopamine differentially alters the slope of the dose-occupancy curves of these receptors, thus sensitivities, at baseline dopamine concentrations. We show that this mechanism can explain biased value learning in both mice and humans and may also contribute to symptoms observed in psychiatric disorders. Our model provides a foundation for understanding the basal ganglia circuit and underscores the significance of tonic dopamine in modulating learning processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare Parkinsonian disorder characterized by problems with movement, balance, cognition, and other symptoms. PSP differs from Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases displaying abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (&#34;tauopathies&#34;) by the presence of pathology not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences, however much of PSP genetics remains unexplained. Here we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP to date including 2,779 cases (2,595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5,584 controls and identified six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (p &lt; 5x10-8) associations including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations revealed a unique oligodendrocytic signature that distinguishes PSP from AD and Parkinsons disease. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identified oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, as well as an association with elevated C4A expression in bulk brain tissue which may be driven by increased C4A copy number in PSP cases. Finally, histological studies demonstrated abnormal tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies including epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identified potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in the pathogenesis of PSP.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuropeptides Substance P and CGRP have long been thought important for pain sensation. Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRP are extensively co-expressed we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated Tac1 and Calca double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRP peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRP are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A central challenge in olfaction is understanding how the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations. Vertebrate animals perceive odors via G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs). In humans, [~]400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family is composed of two major classes: Class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids while Class II ORs, representing the vast majority of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants. How ORs recognize chemically diverse odorants remains poorly understood. A fundamental bottleneck is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here, we uncover fundamental molecular properties of odorant-OR interactions by employing engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modeling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled four cryoEM structures of distinct consORs with unique ligand recognition properties. The structure of a Class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and yielded a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three Class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between Class I and Class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigated dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. We then studied the relation of these dynamic properties with the perturbational complexity index (PCI), which has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independent of behavior. All participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams)., enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. We estimated (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related measures, and found that states of unconsciousness were characterized by a distancing from both the edge of activity propagation and the edge of chaos. We were then able to predict individual subjects PCI (i.e., PCImax) with a mean absolute error below 7%. Our results establish a firm link between the PCI and criticality and provide further evidence for the role of criticality in the emergence of consciousness.

2 Significance StatementComplexity has long been of interest in consciousness science and had a fundamental impact on many of todays theories of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) uses the complexity of the brains response to cortical perturbations to quantify the presence of consciousness. We propose criticality as a unifying framework underlying maximal complexity and sensitivity to perturbation in the conscious brain. We demonstrate that criticality measures derived from resting-state electroencephalography can distinguish conscious from unconscious states, using propofol, xenon and ketamine anesthesia, and from these measures we were able to predict the PCI with a mean error below 7%. Our results support the hypothesis that critical brain dynamics are implicated in the emergence of consciousness and may provide new directions for the assessment of consciousness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Functional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded &gt;3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex and gender are associated with human behavior throughout the lifespan and across health and disease, but whether they are associated with similar or distinct neural phenotypes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in children, sex and gender are uniquely reflected in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain. Unimodal networks are more strongly associated with sex while heteromodal networks are more strongly associated with gender. These results suggest sex and gender are irreducible to one another not only in society but also in biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life adversity is pervasive worldwide and represents a potent risk factor for increased mental health burden across the lifespan. However, there is substantial individual heterogeneity in associations between adversity exposure, neurobiological changes, and mental health problems. Accounting for key features of adversity such as the developmental timing of exposure may clarify associations between adversity, neurodevelopment, and mental health. The present study leverages sparse canonical correlation analysis to characterize modes of covariation between age of adversity exposure and the integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain in a sample of 107 adults. We find that adversity exposure during middle childhood (ages 5-6 and 8-9 in particular) is consistently linked with alterations in white matter tract integrity, such that tracts supporting sensorimotor functions display higher integrity in relation to adversity exposure while tracts supporting cortico-cortical communication display lower integrity. Further, latent patterns of tract integrity linked with adversity experienced across preschool age and middle childhood (ages 4-9) were associated with trauma-related symptoms in adulthood. Our findings underscore that adversity exposure may differentially affect white matter in a function- and developmental-timing specific manner and suggest that adversity experienced between ages 4-9 may shape the development of global white matter tracts in ways that are relevant for adult mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The biological mechanisms that contribute to cocaine and other substance use disorders involve an array of cortical and subcortical systems. Prior work on the development and maintenance of substance use has largely focused on cortico-striatal circuits, with relatively less attention on alterations within and across large-scale functional brain networks, and associated aspects of the dopamine system. The brain-wide pattern of temporal co-activation between distinct brain regions, referred to as the functional connectome, underpins individual differences in behavior. Critically, the functional connectome correlates of substance use and their specificity to dopamine receptor densities relative to other metabotropic receptors classes remains to be established. Methods: We comprehensively characterized brain-wide differences in functional connectivity across multiple scales, including individual connections, regions, and networks in participants with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n=69) and healthy matched controls (n=62), Further, we studied the relationship between the observed functional connectivity signatures of CUD and the spatial distribution of a broad range of normative neurotransmitter receptor and transporter bindings as assessed through 18 different normative positron emission tomography (PET) maps. Results: Our analyses identified a widespread profile of functional connectivity differences between individuals with CUD and matched healthy comparison participants (8.8% of total edges; 8,185 edges; pFWE=0.025). We largely find lower connectivity preferentially linking default network and subcortical regions, and higher within-network connectivity in the default network in participants with CUD. Furthermore, we find consistent and replicable associations between signatures of CUD and normative spatial density of dopamine D2/3 receptors. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed a widespread profile of altered connectivity in individuals with CUD that extends across the functional connectome and implicates multiple circuits. This profile is robustly coupled with normative dopamine D2/3 receptors densities. Underscoring the translational potential of connectomic approaches for the study of in vivo brain functions, CUD-linked aspects of brain function were spatially coupled to disorder relevant neurotransmitter systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Localising effects in space, time and other dimensions is a fundamental goal of magneto- and electro-encephalography research. A popular exploratory approach applies mass-univariate statistics that are corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster inferences, by pooling together neighbouring effects. However, these cluster-based methods have an important limitation: because the inference is at the cluster level, there is no explicit localisation, and one must be cautious about interpreting when and where effects start and end. Sassenhagen &amp; Draschkow (2019) provided an important reminder of this limitation. They also reported results from a simulation, suggesting that estimated onsets are both positively biased and underestimate real onsets in a large proportion of simulated experiments. However, the simulation did not provide results from other methods as a comparison. Using a new simulation, here I demonstrate that cluster-based inferences perform well relative to other standard methods that provide p values at every testing point: correcting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate adjustment leads to higher underestimation, while a maximum statistic leads to higher overestimation.

Researchers using cluster-based inferences will report more accurate onset estimates in the long run than if they use these alternative methods. It is also worth keeping in mind that all common approaches to infer effect onsets rely on a statistical fallacy, because they never explicitly test the implied interaction between statistically significant and non-significant points. Better approaches to onset estimation can be implemented, for instance using change point detection algorithms.</p>
