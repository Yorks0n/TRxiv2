Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity focused on stimulus selectivity in the sensory cortex 1-4. Here we study neural activity in the motor cortex during naturalistic behavior in which mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behavior does not require training and thus allowed us to probe neural coding and connectivity in motor cortex before its activity is shaped by learning a specific task. Neurons typically responded during and after reaching movements and exhibited conjunctive tuning to target location and reward outcome. We used an all-optical 5,4,6,7 method for large-scale causal functional connectivity mapping in vivo. Mapping connectivity between \u003e 20,000,000 excitatory neuronal pairs revealed fine-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (\u003c 100 m) like-to-like connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant weakly connected neurons and sparse strongly connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target-location and reward-outcome but strongly influenced neighboring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviors.\nNetwork-level encoding of local neurotransmitters in cortical astrocytes\nAuthors: Cahill, M. K.; Collard, M.; Tse, V.; Reitman, M. E.; Etchenique, R.; Kirst, C.; Poskanzer, K. E.\nScore: 61.5, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.568932\nSummary ParagraphAstrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2+) signaling1-8. Astrocyte Ca2+ activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity3,4 to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks9-11. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes5,8,12. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2+ responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2+ activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales13-15. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2+ activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.\nOligodendrocytes and neurons contribute to amyloid-β deposition in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Sasmita, A. O.; Depp, C.; Nazarenko, T.; Sun, T.; Siems, S. B.; Yu, X.; Boehler, C.; Ong, E. C.; Bues, B.; Evangelista, L.; Morgado, B.; Wu, Z.; Ruhwedel, T.; Subramanian, S.; Boerensen, F.; Overhoff, K.; Spieth, L.; Berghoff, S. A.; Sadleir, K. R.; Vassar, R.; Eggert, S.; Goebbels, S.; Saito, T.; Saido, T.; Moebius, W.; Castelo-Branco, G.; Klafki, H.-W.; Wirths, O.; Wiltfang, J.; Jaekel, S.; Yan, R.; Nave, K.-A.\nScore: 27.8, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.570514\nIn Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is thought to be of neuronal origin. However, in single-cell RNAseq datasets from mouse and human, we found transcripts of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the amyloidogenic-processing machinery equally abundant in oligodendrocytes (OLs). By cell-type-specific deletion of Bace1 in a humanized knock-in AD model, APPNLGF, we demonstrate that almost a third of cortical A{beta} deposited in plaques is derived from OLs. However, excitatory projection neurons must provide a threshold level of A{beta} production for plaque deposition to occur and for oligodendroglial A{beta} to co-aggregate. Indeed, very few plaques are deposited in the absence of neuronally-derived A{beta}, although soluble A{beta} species are readily detected, especially in subcortical white matter. Our data identify OLs as a source of A{beta} in vivo and further underscore a non-linear relationship between cellular A{beta} production and resulting plaque formation. Ultimately, our observations are relevant for therapeutic strategies aimed at disease prevention in AD.\nRhythmic sampling of multiple decision alternatives in the human brain\nAuthors: Siems, M.; Cao, Y.; Tohidi-Moghaddam, M.; Donner, T. H.; Tsetsos, K.\nScore: 26.3, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570734\nSummaryDuring decision-making attention plays a pivotal role by guiding information sampling between alternatives. We need to optimally encode different options and compare between them. So far the role of attention in decision-making has only been addressed through saccadic displacements. However, looking is not always attending and attending not always looking. The influence of covert attention on decision-making is poorly understood. Here, we combined a three-alternative perceptual choice task with magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings to chart covert attention during decision-formation. We found that rhythmic attentional sampling is a neurophysiological mechanism that can temporally disentangle the conflict between focusing and reorienting attention in decision-making. Embedded within an 11Hz oscillation focused processing and reorienting appeared at the peak and trough of the attention oscillation. Reorienting further intrinsically reset the oscillation and covert attention was dissociable from oculomotor activity. We thus propose that (covert) rhythmic sampling is a general cognitive mechanism harnessed to orchestrate flexible information processing in multi-alternative decisions. Highlights- Assessing covert attention in multi-alternative decision-making with magnetoencephalography (MEG) - Rhythmic sampling as mechanism orchestrating attention between alternatives - Focused information sampling alternates with attention switching between decision alternatives - Covert attention allocation dissociates from oculomotor activity\nState-dependent circuit dynamics of superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells in macaques\nAuthors: Abbaspoor, S.; Hoffman, K. L.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570369\nDiverse neuron classes in hippocampal CA1 have been identified through their heterogeneity in cellular/molecular composition. How these classes relate to the hippocampal function and network dynamics that support cognition in primates remains unclear. Here we report functional cell groups in CA1 of freely-behaving macaques that show a range of spectral phase preferences and varied responses to local network states like the sharp-wave ripple. Segregating superficial-from deep-layer pyramidal cells uncovered differences in firing rate, burstiness, and sharp-wave ripple associated firing. They also showed strata-specific interactions with the inhibitory cell groups. CA1 ensemble recordings revealed the first observations of cell assemblies in the macaque hippocampus, and show that the stratification of pyramidal cells in primates is a major organizing principle of assemblies. These results suggest a sublayer-specific circuit organization in hippocampal CA1 of the freely-behaving macaque that may support dissociable contributions across cognitive and behavioral processes in the primate.\nSpatially resolved molecular and cellular atlas of the mouse brain\nAuthors: Han, L.; Liu, Z.; Jing, Z.; Liu, Y.; Chang, H.; Lei, J.; Peng, Y.; Wang, K.; Xu, Y.; Liu, W.; Wu, Z.; Li, Q.; Shi, X.; Zheng, M.; Wang, H.; Deng, J.; Zhong, Y.; Pan, H.; Lin, J.; Zhang, R.; Chen, Y.; Wu, J.; Xu, M.; Ren, B.; Cheng, M.; Yu, Q.; Song, X.; Lu, Y.; Tang, Y.; Yuan, N.; Sun, S.; An, Y.; Ding, W.; Sun, X.; Wei, Y.; Zhang, S.; Dou, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Han, L.; Zhu, Q.; Xu, J.; Wang, S.; Chen, H.; Wang, D.; Bai, Y.; Liang, Y.; Liu, Y.; Chen, M.; Xie, C.; Bo, B.; Li, M.; Zhang, X.; Ting, W.; Chen, Z.; Fang, J.; Li, S.; Jiang, Y.; Tan, X.; Zuo, G.; Xie, Y.; Li, H.; Tao, Q.; Li, Y.; Liu, J.; Li\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569501\nA comprehensive atlas of genes, cell types, and their spatial distribution across a whole mammalian brain is fundamental for understanding function of the brain. Here, using snRNA-seq and Stereo-seq techniques, we generated a mouse brain atlas with spatial information for 308 cell clusters with single-cell resolution involving over 6 million cells as well as for 29,655 genes. We have identified new astrocyte clusters, and demonstrated that distinct cell clusters exhibit preference for cortical subregions. In addition, we identified 155 genes exhibiting regional specificity in the brainstem, and 513 long non-coding RNA exhibited regional specificity in the adult brain. Parcellation of brain regions based on spatial transcriptomic information showed large overlap with that by traditional method. Furthermore, we have uncovered 411 transcription factor regulons with spatiotemporal specificity during development. Thus, our study has discovered genes and regulon with spatiotemporal specificity, and provided a high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain.\nGeometric experience sculpts the development and dynamics of hippocampal sequential cell assemblies\nAuthors: Farooq, U.; Dragoi, G.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.570026\nEuclidean space is the fabric of the world we live in. Whether and how geometric experience shapes our spatial-temporal representations of the world remained unknown. We deprived rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside translucent spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired neuronal pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear track experiences, partly driven by reduced preconfigured network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects, substantiating the role of geometric experience on hippocampal neural development. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.\nBeta and theta oscillations track effort and previous reward in human basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex during decision making\nAuthors: Hoy, C. W.; de Hemptinne, C.; Wang, S. S.; Harmer, C. J.; Apps, M. A. J.; Husain, M.; Starr, P. A.; Little, S.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570285\nChoosing whether to exert effort to obtain rewards is fundamental to human motivated behavior. However, the neural dynamics underlying the evaluation of reward and effort in humans is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this with chronic intracranial recordings from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia (BG; subthalamic nuclei and globus pallidus) in people with Parkinsons disease performing a decision-making task with offers that varied in levels of reward and physical effort required. This revealed dissociable neural signatures of reward and effort, with BG beta (12-20 Hz) oscillations tracking subjective effort on a single trial basis and PFC theta (4-7 Hz) signaling previous trial reward. Stimulation of PFC increased overall acceptance of offers in addition to increasing the impact of reward on choices. This work uncovers oscillatory mechanisms that guide fundamental decisions to exert effort for reward across BG and PFC, as well as supporting a causal role of PFC for such choices.\nMitochondrial network reorganization and transient expansion during oligodendrocyte generation\nAuthors: Bame, X.; Hill, R. A.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570104\nOligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. This process persists throughout life and is essential for recovery from neurodegeneration. To better understand the cellular checkpoints that occur during oligodendrogenesis, we determined the mitochondrial distribution and morphometrics across the oligodendrocyte lineage in mouse and human cerebral cortex. During oligodendrocyte generation, mitochondrial content expanded concurrently with a change in subcellular partitioning towards the distal processes. These changes were followed by an abrupt loss of mitochondria in the oligodendrocyte processes and myelin, coinciding with sheath compaction. This reorganization and extensive expansion and depletion took 3 days. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria were stationary over days while OPC mitochondrial motility was modulated by animal arousal state within minutes. Aged OPCs also displayed decreased mitochondrial size, content, and motility. Thus, mitochondrial dynamics are linked to oligodendrocyte generation, dynamically modified by their local microenvironment, and altered in the aging brain.\nSocial cognitive regions of human association cortex are selectively connected to the amygdala\nAuthors: Edmonds, D.; Salvo, J. J.; Anderson, N.; Lakshman, M.; Yang, Q.; Kay, K.; Zelano, C.; Braga, R. M.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570477\nReasoning about someones thoughts and intentions - i.e., forming a theory of mind - is an important aspect of social cognition that relies on association areas of the brain that have expanded disproportionately in the human lineage. We recently showed that these association zones comprise parallel distributed networks that, despite occupying adjacent and interdigitated regions, serve dissociable functions. One network is selectively recruited by theory of mind processes. What circuit properties differentiate these parallel networks? Here, we show that social cognitive association areas are intrinsically and selectively connected to regions of the anterior medial temporal lobe that are implicated in emotional learning and social behaviors, including the amygdala at or near the basolateral complex and medial nucleus. The results suggest that social cognitive functions emerge through coordinated activity between amygdala circuits and a distributed association network, and indicate the medial nucleus may play an important role in social cognition in humans.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Neural representations of information are shaped by local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity focused on stimulus selectivity in the sensory cortex 1-4. Here we study neural activity in the motor cortex during naturalistic behavior in which mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behavior does not require training and thus allowed us to probe neural coding and connectivity in motor cortex before its activity is shaped by learning a specific task. Neurons typically responded during and after reaching movements and exhibited conjunctive tuning to target location and reward outcome. We used an all-optical 5,4,6,7 method for large-scale causal functional connectivity mapping in vivo. Mapping connectivity between &gt; 20,000,000 excitatory neuronal pairs revealed fine-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (&lt; 100 m) like-to-like connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant weakly connected neurons and sparse strongly connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target-location and reward-outcome but strongly influenced neighboring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary ParagraphAstrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2&#43;) signaling1-8. Astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity3,4 to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks9-11. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes5,8,12. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2&#43; imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2&#43; responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2&#43; activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales13-15. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is thought to be of neuronal origin. However, in single-cell RNAseq datasets from mouse and human, we found transcripts of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the amyloidogenic-processing machinery equally abundant in oligodendrocytes (OLs). By cell-type-specific deletion of Bace1 in a humanized knock-in AD model, APPNLGF, we demonstrate that almost a third of cortical A{beta} deposited in plaques is derived from OLs. However, excitatory projection neurons must provide a threshold level of A{beta} production for plaque deposition to occur and for oligodendroglial A{beta} to co-aggregate. Indeed, very few plaques are deposited in the absence of neuronally-derived A{beta}, although soluble A{beta} species are readily detected, especially in subcortical white matter. Our data identify OLs as a source of A{beta} in vivo and further underscore a non-linear relationship between cellular A{beta} production and resulting plaque formation. Ultimately, our observations are relevant for therapeutic strategies aimed at disease prevention in AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SummaryDuring decision-making attention plays a pivotal role by guiding information sampling between alternatives. We need to optimally encode different options and compare between them. So far the role of attention in decision-making has only been addressed through saccadic displacements. However, looking is not always attending and attending not always looking. The influence of covert attention on decision-making is poorly understood. Here, we combined a three-alternative perceptual choice task with magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings to chart covert attention during decision-formation. We found that rhythmic attentional sampling is a neurophysiological mechanism that can temporally disentangle the conflict between focusing and reorienting attention in decision-making. Embedded within an 11Hz oscillation focused processing and reorienting appeared at the peak and trough of the attention oscillation. Reorienting further intrinsically reset the oscillation and covert attention was dissociable from oculomotor activity. We thus propose that (covert) rhythmic sampling is a general cognitive mechanism harnessed to orchestrate flexible information processing in multi-alternative decisions.

Highlights- Assessing covert attention in multi-alternative decision-making with magnetoencephalography (MEG)
- Rhythmic sampling as mechanism orchestrating attention between alternatives
- Focused information sampling alternates with attention switching between decision alternatives
- Covert attention allocation dissociates from oculomotor activity</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse neuron classes in hippocampal CA1 have been identified through their heterogeneity in cellular/molecular composition. How these classes relate to the hippocampal function and network dynamics that support cognition in primates remains unclear. Here we report functional cell groups in CA1 of freely-behaving macaques that show a range of spectral phase preferences and varied responses to local network states like the sharp-wave ripple. Segregating superficial-from deep-layer pyramidal cells uncovered differences in firing rate, burstiness, and sharp-wave ripple associated firing. They also showed strata-specific interactions with the inhibitory cell groups. CA1 ensemble recordings revealed the first observations of cell assemblies in the macaque hippocampus, and show that the stratification of pyramidal cells in primates is a major organizing principle of assemblies. These results suggest a sublayer-specific circuit organization in hippocampal CA1 of the freely-behaving macaque that may support dissociable contributions across cognitive and behavioral processes in the primate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A comprehensive atlas of genes, cell types, and their spatial distribution across a whole mammalian brain is fundamental for understanding function of the brain. Here, using snRNA-seq and Stereo-seq techniques, we generated a mouse brain atlas with spatial information for 308 cell clusters with single-cell resolution involving over 6 million cells as well as for 29,655 genes. We have identified new astrocyte clusters, and demonstrated that distinct cell clusters exhibit preference for cortical subregions. In addition, we identified 155 genes exhibiting regional specificity in the brainstem, and 513 long non-coding RNA exhibited regional specificity in the adult brain. Parcellation of brain regions based on spatial transcriptomic information showed large overlap with that by traditional method. Furthermore, we have uncovered 411 transcription factor regulons with spatiotemporal specificity during development. Thus, our study has discovered genes and regulon with spatiotemporal specificity, and provided a high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Euclidean space is the fabric of the world we live in. Whether and how geometric experience shapes our spatial-temporal representations of the world remained unknown. We deprived rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside translucent spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired neuronal pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear track experiences, partly driven by reduced preconfigured network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects, substantiating the role of geometric experience on hippocampal neural development. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Choosing whether to exert effort to obtain rewards is fundamental to human motivated behavior. However, the neural dynamics underlying the evaluation of reward and effort in humans is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this with chronic intracranial recordings from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia (BG; subthalamic nuclei and globus pallidus) in people with Parkinsons disease performing a decision-making task with offers that varied in levels of reward and physical effort required. This revealed dissociable neural signatures of reward and effort, with BG beta (12-20 Hz) oscillations tracking subjective effort on a single trial basis and PFC theta (4-7 Hz) signaling previous trial reward. Stimulation of PFC increased overall acceptance of offers in addition to increasing the impact of reward on choices. This work uncovers oscillatory mechanisms that guide fundamental decisions to exert effort for reward across BG and PFC, as well as supporting a causal role of PFC for such choices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. This process persists throughout life and is essential for recovery from neurodegeneration. To better understand the cellular checkpoints that occur during oligodendrogenesis, we determined the mitochondrial distribution and morphometrics across the oligodendrocyte lineage in mouse and human cerebral cortex. During oligodendrocyte generation, mitochondrial content expanded concurrently with a change in subcellular partitioning towards the distal processes. These changes were followed by an abrupt loss of mitochondria in the oligodendrocyte processes and myelin, coinciding with sheath compaction. This reorganization and extensive expansion and depletion took 3 days. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria were stationary over days while OPC mitochondrial motility was modulated by animal arousal state within minutes. Aged OPCs also displayed decreased mitochondrial size, content, and motility. Thus, mitochondrial dynamics are linked to oligodendrocyte generation, dynamically modified by their local microenvironment, and altered in the aging brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reasoning about someones thoughts and intentions - i.e., forming a theory of mind - is an important aspect of social cognition that relies on association areas of the brain that have expanded disproportionately in the human lineage. We recently showed that these association zones comprise parallel distributed networks that, despite occupying adjacent and interdigitated regions, serve dissociable functions. One network is selectively recruited by theory of mind processes. What circuit properties differentiate these parallel networks? Here, we show that social cognitive association areas are intrinsically and selectively connected to regions of the anterior medial temporal lobe that are implicated in emotional learning and social behaviors, including the amygdala at or near the basolateral complex and medial nucleus. The results suggest that social cognitive functions emerge through coordinated activity between amygdala circuits and a distributed association network, and indicate the medial nucleus may play an important role in social cognition in humans.</p>
