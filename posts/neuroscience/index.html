B.\nScore: 76.6, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572654\nTo survive in evolving environments with uncertain resources, animals need to dynamically adapt their behavior and exhibit flexibility in choosing appropriate behavioral strategies, for example, to exploit familiar choices, to explore and acquire novel information, or to disengage altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal decision strategies during explore/exploit trade-offs. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioral strategies such as exploiting, exploring or disengaging from the environment, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub critical for flexible switching between behavioral strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations, calcium fiber photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behavioral tasks, we found that the MRNs main cell types, GABAergic, glutamatergic (VGluT2-positive), and serotonergic neurons, have complementary functions and drive exploitation, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons, for instance through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN, leads to perseverance in current actions and goals, and thus promotes exploitatory behavior. In contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploratory behavior. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula conveying negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioral switchboard, uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioral strategies. These circuits thus may also play an important role in the etiology and possible treatment of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.\nSleepEEGpy: a Python-based package for the preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of sleep EEG data\nAuthors: Belonosov, G.; Falach, R.; Schmidig, F. J.; Aderka, M.; Zhelezniakov, V.; Shani-Hershkovich, R.; Bar, E.; Nir, Y.\nScore: 59.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572046\nSleep research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to infer brain activity in health and disease. Beyond standard sleep scoring, there is increased interest in advanced EEG analysis that investigates activities at specific times, frequencies, and scalp locations. Such analysis requires preprocessing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and dedicated analysis algorithms and visualizations. While many EEG software packages exist, sleep research has specific considerations (e.g., avoiding particular artifacts, analysis, and visualization in an ongoing non-epoch nature, detection of characteristic oscillatory events, and interface with sleep staging) that require dedicated tools. Currently, sleep investigators typically use available libraries for specific tasks in a fragmented configuration that is inefficient, prone to errors, and requires the burdensome learning of multiple software environments. Here, we present SleepEEGpy, an open-source Python package for sleep EEG data preprocessing and analysis, including (i) cleaning, (ii) independent component analysis, (iii) analysis of sleep events, (iv) analysis of spectral features, and associated visualization tools. SleepEEGpy builds upon MNE-Python, YASA, and SpecParam (formerly FOOOF) tools to provide an all-in-one package for comprehensive yet straightforward sleep EEG research. We demonstrate the SleepEEGpy pipeline and its functionalities by applying it to overnight high-density EEG data in healthy participants, revealing multiple characteristic activity signatures typical of each vigilance state. These include alpha oscillations in wakefulness, sleep spindle and slow wave activities in NREM sleep, and theta activity in REM sleep. We hope that this package will be embraced and further developed by the sleep research community, allowing investigators to focus more on science and improve reproducibility among research groups.\nA single computational objective drives specialization of streams in visual cortex\nAuthors: Finzi, D.; Margalit, E.; Kay, K.; Yamins, D. L. K.; Grill-Spector, K.\nScore: 52.6, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572460\nHuman visual cortex is organized into dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. A long-standing hypothesis is that the functional organization into streams emerged to support distinct visual behaviors. Here, we use a neural network-based computational model and a massive fMRI dataset to test how visual streams emerge. We find that models trained for stream-specific visual behaviors poorly capture neural responses and organization. Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts neural responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors, and suggest instead that functional organization arises from a single principle: balancing general representation learning with local spatial constraints.\nEgr1 is a sex-specific regulator of neuronal chromatin, synaptic plasticity, and behaviour\nAuthors: Rocks, D.; Purisic, E.; Gallo, E. F.; Greally, J. M.; Suzuki, M.; Kundakovic, M.\nScore: 32.7, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572697\nSex differences are found in brain structure and function across species, and across brain disorders in humans1-3. The major source of brain sex differences is differential secretion of steroid hormones from the gonads across the lifespan4. Specifically, ovarian hormones oestrogens and progesterone are known to dynamically change structure and function of the adult female brain, having a major impact on psychiatric risk5-7. However, due to limited molecular studies in female rodents8, very little is still known about molecular drivers of female-specific brain and behavioural plasticity. Here we show that overexpressing Egr1, a candidate oestrous cycle-dependent transcription factor9, induces sex-specific changes in ventral hippocampal neuronal chromatin, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity, along with hippocampus-dependent behaviours. Importantly, Egr1 overexpression mimics the high-oestrogenic phase of the oestrous cycle, and affects behaviours in ovarian hormone-depleted females but not in males. We demonstrate that Egr1 opens neuronal chromatin directly across the sexes, although with limited genomic overlap. Our study not only reveals the first sex-specific chromatin regulator in the brain, but also provides functional evidence that this sex-specific gene regulation drives neuronal gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Our study exemplifies an innovative sex-based approach to studying neuronal gene regulation1 in order to understand sex-specific synaptic and behavioural plasticity and inform novel brain disease treatments.\nMachine learning of brain-specific biomarkers from EEG\nAuthors: Bomatter, P.; Paillard, J.; Garces, P.; Hipp, J. F.; Engemann, D. A.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571864\nElectroencephalography (EEG) has a long history as a clinical tool to study brain function, and its potential to derive biomarkers for various applications is far from exhausted. Machine learning (ML) can guide future innovation by harnessing the wealth of complex EEG signals to isolate relevant brain activity. Yet, ML studies in EEG tend to ignore physiological artifacts, which may cause problems for deriving biomarkers specific to the central nervous system (CNS). We present a framework for conceptualizing machine learning from CNS versus peripheral signals measured with EEG. A common signal representation across the frequency spectrum based on Morlet wavelets allowed us to define traditional brain activity features (e.g. log power) and alternative inputs used by state-of-the-art ML approaches (covariance matrices). Using more than 2600 EEG recordings from large public databases (TUAB, TDBRAIN), we studied the impact of peripheral signals and artifact removal techniques on ML models in exemplary age and sex prediction analyses. Across benchmarks, basic artifact rejection improved model performance whereas further removal of peripheral signals using ICA decreased performance. Our analyses revealed that peripheral signals enable age and sex prediction. However, they explained only a fraction of the performance provided by brain signals. We show that brain signals and body signals, both reflected in the EEG, allow for prediction of personal characteristics. While these results may depend on specific prediction problems, our work suggests that great care is needed to separate these signals when the goal is to develop CNS-specific biomarkers using ML.\nA bipolar taxonomy of adult human brain sulcal morphology related to timing of fetalsulcation and trans-sulcal gene expression gradients\nAuthors: Snyder, W. E.; Vertes, P. E.; Kyriakopoulou, V.; Wagstyl, K.; Williams, L. Z. J.; Moraczewski, D.; Thomas, A. G.; Karolis, V. R.; Seidlitz, J. R.; Riviere, D.; Robinson, E. C.; Mangin, J.-F.; Raznahan, A.; Bullmore, E. T.\nScore: 25.6, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572454\nWe developed a computational pipeline (now provided as a resource) for measuring morphological similarity between cortical surface sulci to construct a sulcal phenotype network (SPN) from each magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in an adult cohort (N=34,725; 45-82 years). Networks estimated from pairwise similarities of 40 sulci on 5 morphological metrics comprised two clusters of sulci, represented also by the bipolar distribution of sulci on a linear-to-complex dimension. Linear sulci were more heritable and typically located in unimodal cortex; complex sulci were less heritable and typically located in heteromodal cortex. Aligning these results with an independent fetal brain MRI cohort (N=228; 21-36 gestational weeks), we found that linear sulci formed earlier, and the earliest and latest-forming sulci had the least between-adult variation. Using high-resolution maps of cortical gene expression, we found that linear sulcation is mechanistically underpinned by trans-sulcal gene expression gradients enriched for developmental processes.\nSomatostatin interneurons control the timing of developmental desynchronization in cortical networks\nAuthors: Modol, L.; Moissidis, M.; Selten, M.; Oozeer, F.; Marin, O.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572767\nSynchronous neuronal activity is a hallmark of the early developing brain. In the mouse cerebral cortex, activity decorrelates during the second week of postnatal development, progressively acquiring the characteristic pattern of sparse coding underlying the integration of multidimensional sensory information. The maturation of inhibition seems critical for this process, but the specific types of interneurons involved in this crucial transition of network activity in the developing cortex remain unknown. Using in vivo volumetric and longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging during the period that precedes the change from highly synchronous to decorrelated activity, we identify somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons as critical modulators of this switch. Modulation of the activity of SST+ cells accelerates or delays the decorrelation of cortical network activity, a process that involves regulating the degree of maturation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons. SST+ cells critically link sensory inputs with local circuits controlling the neural dynamics in the developing cortex while modulating the integration of other interneurons into nascent cortical circuits.\nComparative basolateral amygdala connectomics reveals dissociable single-neuron projection patterns to frontal cortex in macaques and mice\nAuthors: Zeisler, Z. R.; Heslin, K. A.; Stoll, F. M.; Hof, P. R.; Clem, R. L.; Rudebeck, P. H.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571711\nShort abstractThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects to the frontal cortex (FC) in both rodents and primates, but the comparative organization of single-neuron BLA-FC projections is unknown. Using a barcoded connectomic approach, we found that BLA neurons are more likely to project to multiple distinct parts of FC in mice than in macaques. Further, while single BLA neuron projections to nucleus accumbens are similarly organized in mice and macaques, BLA-FC connections differ.\nMultilayer Network Analysis across Cortical Depths in Resting-State 7T fMRI\nAuthors: Kotlarz, P.; Lankinen, K.; Hakonen, M.; Turpin, T.; Polimeni, J. R.; Ahveninen, J.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573208\nIn graph theory, \"multilayer networks\" represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. A neuroscience example is the hierarchy of connections between different cortical depths or \"lamina\". This hierarchy is becoming non-invasively accessible in humans using ultra-high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7T fMRI (1-mm3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We then compared networks where the inter-regional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (\"layer-by-layer matrices\") to those considering all possible connections between regions and cortical depths (\"multilayer matrix\"). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes such as network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared to the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial aspects of the cortex dominated information transfer and deeper aspects clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic brain regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information. Multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this hierarchy.\nAn AAV capsid reprogrammed to bind human Transferrin Receptor mediates brain-wide gene delivery\nAuthors: Huang, Q.; Chan, K.

G.; Powell, M.; Chen, A. T.; Barry, A. J.; Eid, F.-E.; Chan, Y. A.; Deverman, B. E.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572615\nDeveloping vehicles that efficiently deliver genes throughout the human central nervous system (CNS) will broaden the range of treatable genetic diseases. We engineered an AAV capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across a human brain endothelial cell layer and, relative to AAV9, provided 40-50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knock-in mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild type mice. When used to deliver GBA1, mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinsons disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared to AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a promising vector for human CNS gene therapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To survive in evolving environments with uncertain resources, animals need to dynamically adapt their behavior and exhibit flexibility in choosing appropriate behavioral strategies, for example, to exploit familiar choices, to explore and acquire novel information, or to disengage altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal decision strategies during explore/exploit trade-offs. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioral strategies such as exploiting, exploring or disengaging from the environment, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub critical for flexible switching between behavioral strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations, calcium fiber photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behavioral tasks, we found that the MRNs main cell types, GABAergic, glutamatergic (VGluT2-positive), and serotonergic neurons, have complementary functions and drive exploitation, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons, for instance through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN, leads to perseverance in current actions and goals, and thus promotes exploitatory behavior. In contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2&#43; neurons drives exploratory behavior. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula conveying negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioral switchboard, uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioral strategies. These circuits thus may also play an important role in the etiology and possible treatment of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to infer brain activity in health and disease. Beyond standard sleep scoring, there is increased interest in advanced EEG analysis that investigates activities at specific times, frequencies, and scalp locations. Such analysis requires preprocessing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and dedicated analysis algorithms and visualizations. While many EEG software packages exist, sleep research has specific considerations (e.g., avoiding particular artifacts, analysis, and visualization in an ongoing non-epoch nature, detection of characteristic oscillatory events, and interface with sleep staging) that require dedicated tools. Currently, sleep investigators typically use available libraries for specific tasks in a  fragmented configuration that is inefficient, prone to errors, and requires the burdensome learning of multiple software environments. Here, we present SleepEEGpy, an open-source Python package for sleep EEG data preprocessing and analysis, including (i) cleaning, (ii) independent component analysis, (iii) analysis of sleep events, (iv) analysis of spectral features, and associated visualization tools. SleepEEGpy builds upon MNE-Python, YASA, and SpecParam (formerly FOOOF) tools to provide an all-in-one package for comprehensive yet straightforward sleep EEG research. We demonstrate the SleepEEGpy pipeline and its functionalities by applying it to overnight high-density EEG data in healthy participants, revealing multiple characteristic activity signatures typical of each vigilance state. These include alpha oscillations in wakefulness, sleep spindle and slow wave activities in NREM sleep, and theta activity in REM sleep. We hope that this package will be embraced and further developed by the sleep research community, allowing investigators to focus more on science and improve reproducibility among research groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human visual cortex is organized into dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. A long-standing hypothesis is that the functional organization into streams emerged to support distinct visual behaviors. Here, we use a neural network-based computational model and a massive fMRI dataset to test how visual streams emerge. We find that models trained for stream-specific visual behaviors poorly capture neural responses and organization. Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts neural responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors, and suggest instead that functional organization arises from a single principle: balancing general representation learning with local spatial constraints.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex differences are found in brain structure and function across species, and across brain disorders in humans1-3. The major source of brain sex differences is differential secretion of steroid hormones from the gonads across the lifespan4. Specifically, ovarian hormones oestrogens and progesterone are known to dynamically change structure and function of the adult female brain, having a major impact on psychiatric risk5-7. However, due to limited molecular studies in female rodents8, very little is still known about molecular drivers of female-specific brain and behavioural plasticity. Here we show that overexpressing Egr1, a candidate oestrous cycle-dependent transcription factor9, induces sex-specific changes in ventral hippocampal neuronal chromatin, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity, along with hippocampus-dependent behaviours. Importantly, Egr1 overexpression mimics the high-oestrogenic phase of the oestrous cycle, and affects behaviours in ovarian hormone-depleted females but not in males. We demonstrate that Egr1 opens neuronal chromatin directly across the sexes, although with limited genomic overlap. Our study not only reveals the first sex-specific chromatin regulator in the brain, but also provides functional evidence that this sex-specific gene regulation drives neuronal gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Our study exemplifies an innovative sex-based approach to studying neuronal gene regulation1 in order to understand sex-specific synaptic and behavioural plasticity and inform novel brain disease treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electroencephalography (EEG) has a long history as a clinical tool to study brain function, and its potential to derive biomarkers for various applications is far from exhausted. Machine learning (ML) can guide future innovation by harnessing the wealth of complex EEG signals to isolate relevant brain activity. Yet, ML studies in EEG tend to ignore physiological artifacts, which may cause problems for deriving biomarkers specific to the central nervous system (CNS). We present a framework for conceptualizing machine learning from CNS versus peripheral signals measured with EEG. A common signal representation across the frequency spectrum based on Morlet wavelets allowed us to define traditional brain activity features (e.g. log power) and alternative inputs used by state-of-the-art ML approaches (covariance matrices). Using more than 2600 EEG recordings from large public databases (TUAB, TDBRAIN), we studied the impact of peripheral signals and artifact removal techniques on ML models in exemplary age and sex prediction analyses. Across benchmarks, basic artifact rejection improved model performance whereas further removal of peripheral signals using ICA decreased performance. Our analyses revealed that peripheral signals enable age and sex prediction. However, they explained only a fraction of the performance provided by brain signals. We show that brain signals and body signals, both reflected in the EEG, allow for prediction of personal characteristics. While these results may depend on specific prediction problems, our work suggests that great care is needed to separate these signals when the goal is to develop CNS-specific biomarkers using ML.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We developed a computational pipeline (now provided as a resource) for measuring morphological similarity between cortical surface sulci to construct a sulcal phenotype network (SPN) from each magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in an adult cohort (N=34,725; 45-82 years). Networks estimated from pairwise similarities of 40 sulci on 5 morphological metrics comprised two clusters of sulci, represented also by the bipolar distribution of sulci on a linear-to-complex dimension. Linear sulci were more heritable and typically located in unimodal cortex; complex sulci were less heritable and typically located in heteromodal cortex. Aligning these results with an independent fetal brain MRI cohort (N=228; 21-36 gestational weeks), we found that linear sulci formed earlier, and the earliest and latest-forming sulci had the least between-adult variation. Using high-resolution maps of cortical gene expression, we found that linear sulcation is mechanistically underpinned by trans-sulcal gene expression gradients enriched for developmental processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synchronous neuronal activity is a hallmark of the early developing brain. In the mouse cerebral cortex, activity decorrelates during the second week of postnatal development, progressively acquiring the characteristic pattern of sparse coding underlying the integration of multidimensional sensory information. The maturation of inhibition seems critical for this process, but the specific types of interneurons involved in this crucial transition of network activity in the developing cortex remain unknown. Using in vivo volumetric and longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging during the period that precedes the change from highly synchronous to decorrelated activity, we identify somatostatin-expressing (SST&#43;) interneurons as critical modulators of this switch. Modulation of the activity of SST&#43; cells accelerates or delays the decorrelation of cortical network activity, a process that involves regulating the degree of maturation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV&#43;) interneurons. SST&#43; cells critically link sensory inputs with local circuits controlling the neural dynamics in the developing cortex while modulating the integration of other interneurons into nascent cortical circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In graph theory, &#34;multilayer networks&#34; represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. A neuroscience example is the hierarchy of connections between different cortical depths or &#34;lamina&#34;. This hierarchy is becoming non-invasively accessible in humans using ultra-high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7T fMRI (1-mm3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We then compared networks where the inter-regional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (&#34;layer-by-layer matrices&#34;) to those considering all possible connections between regions and cortical depths (&#34;multilayer matrix&#34;). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes such as network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared to the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial aspects of the cortex dominated information transfer and deeper aspects clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic brain regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information. Multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this hierarchy.</p>

We engineered an AAV capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across a human brain endothelial cell layer and, relative to AAV9, provided 40-50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knock-in mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild type mice. When used to deliver GBA1, mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinsons disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared to AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a promising vector for human CNS gene therapy.</p>
