Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified1-6. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.\nDual-targeting CRISPR-CasRx reduces C9orf72 ALS/FTD sense and antisense repeat RNAs in vitro and in vivo\nAuthors: Kempthorne, L.; Vaizoglu, D.; Cammack, A.

A.; Petrucelli, L.; Rihel, J.; Isaacs, A. M.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577366\nThe most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a G4C2 repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.\nDisuse-driven plasticity in the human thalamus and putamen\nAuthors: Chauvin, R.

F.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566031\nMotor adaptation in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops has been studied mainly in animals using invasive electrophysiology. Here, we leverage functional neuroimaging in humans to study motor circuit plasticity in the human subcortex. We employed an experimental paradigm that combined two weeks of upper-extremity immobilization with daily resting-state and motor task fMRI before, during, and after the casting period. We previously showed that limb disuse leads to decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the contralateral somatomotor cortex (SM1) with the ipsilateral somatomotor cortex, increased FC with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) as well as the emergence of high amplitude, fMRI signal pulses localized in the contralateral SM1, supplementary motor area and the cerebellum. From our prior observations, it remains unclear whether the disuse plasticity affects the thalamus and striatum. We extended our analysis to include these subcortical regions and found that both exhibit strengthened cortical FC and spontaneous fMRI signal pulses induced by limb disuse. The dorsal posterior putamen and the central thalamus, mainly CM, VLP and VIM nuclei, showed disuse pulses and FC changes that lined up with fmri task activations from the Human connectome project motor system localizer, acquired before casting for each participant. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops in human motor plasticity and a potential link with the physiology of sleep regulation. Additionally, similarities with FC observation from Parkinson Disease (PD) questions a pathophysiological link with limb disuse.\nStandardised Measurements for Monitoring and Comparing Multiphoton Microscope Systems\nAuthors: Lees, R.

The scope of this protocol is purposefully limited to focus on hardware, touching on software and data analysis routines only where relevant. The intended audiences are scientists using and building multiphoton microscopes in their laboratories. The goal is that any scientist, not only those with optical expertise, can test whether their multiphoton microscope is performing well and producing consistent data over the lifetime of their system.\nTDP-43 loss induces extensive cryptic polyadenylation in ALS/FTD\nAuthors: Bryce-Smith, S.; Brown, A.-L.; Mehta, P.

A key consequence of TDP-43 nuclear loss is the de-repression of cryptic exons. Whilst TDP-43 regulated cryptic splicing is increasingly well catalogued, cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, which define the 3 end of last exons, have been largely overlooked, especially when not associated with novel upstream splice junctions. We developed a novel bioinformatic approach to reliably identify distinct APA event types: alternative last exons (ALE), 3UTR extensions (3Ext) and intronic polyadenylation (IPA) events. We identified novel neuronal cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss of function by systematically applying our pipeline to a compendium of publicly available and in house datasets. We find that TDP-43 binding sites and target motifs are enriched at these cryptic events and that TDP-43 can have both repressive and enhancing action on APA. Importantly, all categories of cryptic APA can also be identified in ALS and FTD post mortem brain regions with TDP-43 proteinopathy underlining their potential disease relevance. RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses indicate that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript and translation. Intriguingly, cryptic 3Exts occur in multiple transcription factors, such as ELK1, SIX3, and TLX1, and lead to an increase in wild-type protein levels and function. Finally, we show that an increase in RNA stability leading to a higher cytoplasmic localisation underlies these observations. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces a novel category of cryptic RNA processing events and we expand the palette of TDP-43 loss consequences by showing this can also lead to an increase in normal protein translation.\nAdult sex change leads to extensive forebrain reorganization in clownfish\nAuthors: Parker, C. G.; Gruenhagen, G. W.; Hegarty, B. E.; Histed, A. R.; Streelman, J. T.; Rhodes, J. S.; Johnson, Z. V.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577753\nSexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish.\nAn inductive bias for slowly changing features in human reinforcement learning\nAuthors: Hedrich, N. L.; Schulz, E.; Hall-McMaster, S.; Schuck, N. W.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576910\nIdentifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 100 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Participants accrued more reward and achieved better generalisation to unseen feature values when a bandits relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. Participants were also more likely to incorrectly base their choices on the irrelevant feature when it changed slowly versus quickly. These effects were stronger when participants experienced the feature speed before learning about rewards. Modelling this behaviour with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. Author SummaryLearning experiments in the laboratory are often assumed to exist in a vacuum, where participants solve a given task independently of how they learn in more natural circumstances. But humans and other animals are in fact well known to \"meta learn\", i.e. to leverage generalisable assumptions about how to learn from other experiences. Taking inspiration from a well-known machine learning technique known as slow feature analysis, we investigated one specific instance of such an assumption in learning: the possibility that humans tend to focus on slowly rather than quickly changing features when learning about rewards. To test this, we developed a task where participants had to learn the value of stimuli composed of two features. Participants indeed learned better from a slowly rather than quickly changing feature that predicted reward and were more distracted by the reward-irrelevant feature when it changed slowly. Computational modelling of participant behaviour indicated that participants had a higher learning rate for slowly changing features from the outset. Hence, our results support the idea that human reinforcement learning reflects a priori assumptions about the reward structure in natural environments.\nFrontal noradrenergic and cholinergic transients exhibit distinct spatiotemporal dynamics during competitive decision-making\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Ortega, H. K.; Kelly, E. B.; Indajang, J.; Feng, J.; Li, Y.; Kwan, A. C.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576893\nNorepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) are neuromodulators that are crucial for learning and decision-making. In the cortex, NE and ACh are released at specific sites along neuromodulatory axons, which would constrain their spatiotemporal dynamics at the subcellular scale. However, how the fluctuating patterns of NE and ACh signaling may be linked to behavioral events is unknown. Here, leveraging genetically encoded NE and ACh indicators, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the superficial layer of the mouse medial frontal cortex during decision-making. Head-fixed mice engage in a competitive game called matching pennies against a computer opponent. We show that both NE and ACh transients carry information about decision-related variables including choice, outcome, and reinforcer. However, the two neuromodulators differ in their spatiotemporal pattern of task-related activation. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, using optogenetics we found that evoked elevation of NE, but not ACh, in the medial frontal cortex increases the propensity of the animals to switch and explore alternate options. Taken together, the results reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns of rapid ACh and NE transients at the subcellular scale during decision-making in mice, which may endow these neuromodulators with different ways to impact neural plasticity to mediate learning and adaptive behavior.\nLeptin Activated Hypothalamic BNC2 Neurons Acutely Suppress Food Intake\nAuthors: Tan, H. L.; Yin, L.; Tan, Y.; Ivanov, J.; Plucinska, K.; Ilanges, A.; Herb, B. R.; Wang, P.; Kosse, C.; Cohen, P.; Lin, D.; Friedman, J. M.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577315\nLeptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism1. Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons2. However, while AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect3-5. This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that suppresses appetite on a rapid time scale. Here, we report the discovery of a novel population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 (Bnc2) that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is finely tuned by leptin, sensory food cues, and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action.\nSARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease activates nociceptors to drive sneeze and pain\nAuthors: Mali, S.

M.\nScore: 74.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575114\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian behavior and physiology undergo dramatic changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified1-6. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a G4C2 repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motor adaptation in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops has been studied mainly in animals using invasive electrophysiology. Here, we leverage functional neuroimaging in humans to study motor circuit plasticity in the human subcortex. We employed an experimental paradigm that combined two weeks of upper-extremity immobilization with daily resting-state and motor task fMRI before, during, and after the casting period. We previously showed that limb disuse leads to decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the contralateral somatomotor cortex (SM1) with the ipsilateral somatomotor cortex, increased FC with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) as well as the emergence of high amplitude, fMRI signal pulses localized in the contralateral SM1, supplementary motor area and the cerebellum. From our prior observations, it remains unclear whether the disuse plasticity affects the thalamus and striatum. We extended our analysis to include these subcortical regions and found that both exhibit strengthened cortical FC and spontaneous fMRI signal pulses induced by limb disuse. The dorsal posterior putamen and the central thalamus, mainly CM, VLP and VIM nuclei, showed disuse pulses and FC changes that lined up with fmri task activations from the Human connectome project motor system localizer, acquired before casting for each participant. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops in human motor plasticity and a potential link with the physiology of sleep regulation. Additionally, similarities with FC observation from Parkinson Disease (PD) questions a pathophysiological link with limb disuse.</p>

The scope of this protocol is purposefully limited to focus on hardware, touching on software and data analysis routines only where relevant. The intended audiences are scientists using and building multiphoton microscopes in their laboratories. The goal is that any scientist, not only those with optical expertise, can test whether their multiphoton microscope is performing well and producing consistent data over the lifetime of their system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is the hallmark of ALS, occurring in over 97% of cases. A key consequence of TDP-43 nuclear loss is the de-repression of cryptic exons. Whilst TDP-43 regulated cryptic splicing is increasingly well catalogued, cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, which define the 3 end of last exons, have been largely overlooked, especially when not associated with novel upstream splice junctions. We developed a novel bioinformatic approach to reliably identify distinct APA event types: alternative last exons (ALE), 3UTR extensions (3Ext) and intronic polyadenylation (IPA) events. We identified novel neuronal cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss of function by systematically applying our pipeline to a compendium of publicly available and in house datasets. We find that TDP-43 binding sites and target motifs are enriched at these cryptic events and that TDP-43 can have both repressive and enhancing action on APA. Importantly, all categories of cryptic APA can also be identified in ALS and FTD post mortem brain regions with TDP-43 proteinopathy underlining their potential disease relevance. RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses indicate that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript and translation. Intriguingly, cryptic 3Exts occur in multiple transcription factors, such as ELK1, SIX3, and TLX1, and lead to an increase in wild-type protein levels and function. Finally, we show that an increase in RNA stability leading to a higher cytoplasmic localisation underlies these observations. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces a novel category of cryptic RNA processing events and we expand the palette of TDP-43 loss consequences by showing this can also lead to an increase in normal protein translation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 100 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Participants accrued more reward and achieved better generalisation to unseen feature values when a bandits relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. Participants were also more likely to incorrectly base their choices on the irrelevant feature when it changed slowly versus quickly. These effects were stronger when participants experienced the feature speed before learning about rewards. Modelling this behaviour with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

Author SummaryLearning experiments in the laboratory are often assumed to exist in a vacuum, where participants solve a given task independently of how they learn in more natural circumstances. But humans and other animals are in fact well known to &#34;meta learn&#34;, i.e. to leverage generalisable assumptions about how to learn from other experiences. Taking inspiration from a well-known machine learning technique known as slow feature analysis, we investigated one specific instance of such an assumption in learning: the possibility that humans tend to focus on slowly rather than quickly changing features when learning about rewards. To test this, we developed a task where participants had to learn the value of stimuli composed of two features. Participants indeed learned better from a slowly rather than quickly changing feature that predicted reward and were more distracted by the reward-irrelevant feature when it changed slowly. Computational modelling of participant behaviour indicated that participants had a higher learning rate for slowly changing features from the outset. Hence, our results support the idea that human reinforcement learning reflects a priori assumptions about the reward structure in natural environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) are neuromodulators that are crucial for learning and decision-making. In the cortex, NE and ACh are released at specific sites along neuromodulatory axons, which would constrain their spatiotemporal dynamics at the subcellular scale. However, how the fluctuating patterns of NE and ACh signaling may be linked to behavioral events is unknown. Here, leveraging genetically encoded NE and ACh indicators, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the superficial layer of the mouse medial frontal cortex during decision-making. Head-fixed mice engage in a competitive game called matching pennies against a computer opponent. We show that both NE and ACh transients carry information about decision-related variables including choice, outcome, and reinforcer. However, the two neuromodulators differ in their spatiotemporal pattern of task-related activation. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, using optogenetics we found that evoked elevation of NE, but not ACh, in the medial frontal cortex increases the propensity of the animals to switch and explore alternate options. Taken together, the results reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns of rapid ACh and NE transients at the subcellular scale during decision-making in mice, which may endow these neuromodulators with different ways to impact neural plasticity to mediate learning and adaptive behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism1. Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons2. However, while AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect3-5. This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that suppresses appetite on a rapid time scale. Here, we report the discovery of a novel population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 (Bnc2) that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is finely tuned by leptin, sensory food cues, and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers symptoms such as sneezing, aches and pain.1 These symptoms are mediated by a subset of sensory neurons, known as nociceptors, that detect noxious stimuli, densely innervate the airway epithelium, and interact with airway resident epithelial and immune cells.2-6 However, the mechanisms by which viral infection activates these neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes are unknown. Here, we show that the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) directly activates airway-innervating trigeminal and vagal nociceptors in mice and human iPSC-derived nociceptors. PLpro elicits sneezing and acute pain in mice and triggers the release of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from airway afferents. We find that PLpro-induced sneeze and pain requires the host TRPA1 ion channel that has been previously demonstrated to mediate pain, cough, and airway inflammation.7-9 Our findings are the first demonstration of a viral product that directly activates sensory neurons to trigger pain and airway reflexes and highlight a new role for PLpro and nociceptors in COVID-19.</p>
