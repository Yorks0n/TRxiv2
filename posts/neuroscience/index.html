E.; Spruston, N.\nScore: 64.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551900\nCognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.\nConstructed languages are processed by the same brain mechanisms as natural languages\nAuthors: Malik-Moraleda, S.; Taliaferro, M.; Shannon, S.; Jhingan, N.; Swords, S.; Peterson, D. J.; Frommer, P.; Okrand, M.; Sams, J.; Cardwell, R.; Freeman, C.; Fedorenko, E.\nScore: 160.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550667\nWhat constitutes a language? Natural languages share some features with other domains: from math, to music, to gesture. However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little or no response to diverse non-linguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages, or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and logic. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n=19 speakers)-- created to resemble natural languages--and fictional conlangs (Klingon (n=10), Navi (n=9), High Valyrian (n=3), and Dothraki (n=3)), created to differ from natural languages, and suggests that conlangs and natural languages share critical features and that the notable differences between conlangs and natural language are not consequential for the cognitive and neural mechanisms that they engage.\nThe Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) Unravels Changes in Homeostatic and Disease-Associated Microglia Subsets across Neurodegenerative Conditions\nAuthors: Martins-Ferreira, R.; Calafell-Segura, J.; Leal, B.; Rodriguez-Ubreva, J.; Mereu, E.; Pinho e Costa, P.; Ballestar, E.\nScore: 31.6, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.550767\nDysregulated microglia activation, leading to neuroinflammation, is crucial in neurodegenerative disease development and progression. The initial M1/M2 dual activation classification for microglia is outdated. Even the disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype, firstly described in mice, falls short in representing the diverse microglia phenotypes in pathology. In this study, we have constructed a transcriptomic atlas of human brain immune cells by integrating single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq datasets from multiple neurodegenerative conditions. Sixteen datasets were included, comprising 295 samples from patients with Alzheimers disease, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body diseases, COVID-19, and healthy controls. The integrated Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) dataset included 60,557 nuclei and revealed 11 microglial subpopulations distributed across all pathological and healthy conditions. Among these, we identified four different homeostatic clusters as well as pathological phenotypes. These included two stages of early and late activation of the DAM phenotype and the disease-inflammatory macrophage (DIM) phenotype, which was recently described in mice, and is also present in human microglia, as indicated by our analysis. The high versatility of microglia is evident through changes in subset distribution across various pathologies, suggesting their contribution in shaping pathological phenotypes. Our analysis showed overall depletion of four substates of homeostatic microglia, and expansion of niche subpopulations within the DAM and DIM spectrum across distinct neurodegenerative pathologies. The HuMicA is invaluable in advancing the study of microglia biology in both healthy and disease settings.\nAlpha oscillations support the efficiency of guided visual search by inhibiting both target and distractor features in early visual cortex\nAuthors: Duecker, K.; Shapiro, K.; Hanslmayr, S.; Wolfe, J.; Pan, Y.; Jensen, O.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551520\nVisual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritized for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Here, we used MEG in combination with Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to understand the neural correlates of feature-guided visual search. RIFT served as a continuous read-out of the neuronal excitability to the search stimuli and revealed evidence for target boosting and distractor suppression in early visual cortex. These findings were complemented by an increase in occipital alpha power predicting faster responses and higher hit rates, as well as reduced RIFT responses to all stimuli, regardless of their task-relevance. We propose that alpha oscillations in early visual regions implement a blanket inhibition that reduces neuronal excitability to both target and distractor features. As the excitability of neurons encoding the target features is boosted, these neurons overcome the inhibition, facilitating guidance towards task-relevant stimuli. Our results provide novel insights on a mechanism in early visual regions that supports selective attention through inhibition.\nReusable, flexible, and lightweight chronic implants for Neuropixels probes\nAuthors: Bimbard, C.; Takacs, F.; Fabre, J. M.; Melin, M. D.; O'Neill, N.; Robacha, M.; Street, J. S.; van Beest, E. H.; Churchland, A. K.; Harris, K. D.; Kullmann, D. M.; Lignani, G.; Carandini, M.; Coen, P.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551752\nUnderstanding neural processes such as memory formation, learning, or aging requires tracking the activity of neural populations across short and long time scales. Such longitudinal recordings can be achieved with chronically implanted Neuropixels probes. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in small animals like mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. In this initial preprint, we present the \"Apollo Implant\", an open-source and editable device that meets all these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The assembled implant comprises two modules: a recoverable \"payload\" module, and a \"docking\" module that is cemented to the skull. The design is readily adjustable: the distance between probes, angle of insertion, and depth of penetration can all be easily changed. We tested the implant across multiple labs, and in head-fixed and freely moving animals. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant thus provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.\nA contrastive coding account of category selectivity in the ventral visual stream\nAuthors: Prince, J. S.; Alvarez, G. A.; Konkle, T.\nScore: 27.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551888\nModular and distributed theories of category selectivity along the ventral visual stream have long existed in tension. Here, we present a reconciling framework, based on a series of analyses relating category-selective tuning within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, visual category-selective tuning naturally emerges for classic categories of faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits. Finally, these pre-identified units from a single model can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of the human visual system, even under a constrained sparse-positive encoding procedure. The success of this model indicates that the nature of category-selective tuning in the human brain (e.g. for faces or scenes) is dependent on the learning diet, and best understood in the context of the full scope of experienced visual input. Broadly, we offer a unifying theoretical account where category-selective tuning naturally emerges as a consequence of positive information routing through hierarchical population codes, in order to disentangle the statistics of visual experience.\nPatient iPSC models reveal glia-intrinsic phenotypes in multiple sclerosis\nAuthors: Clayton, B. L. L.; Barbar, L.; Sapar, M.; Rusielewicz, T.; Kalpana, K.; Migliori, B.; The NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array, ; Paull, D.; Brenner, K.; Moroziewicz, D.; Sand, I. K.; Casaccia, P.; Tesar, P. J.; Fossati, V.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551553\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, typically resulting in significant neurological disability that worsens over time. While considerable progress has been made in defining the immune systems role in MS pathophysiology, the contribution of intrinsic CNS-cell dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we generated the largest reported collection of iPSC lines from people with MS spanning diverse clinical subtypes and differentiated them into glia-enriched cultures. Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we observed several distinguishing characteristics of MS cultures pointing to glia-intrinsic disease mechanisms. We found that iPSC-derived cultures from people with primary progressive MS contained fewer oligodendrocytes. Moreover, iPSC-oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes from people with MS showed increased expression of immune and inflammatory genes that match those of glial cells from MS postmortem brains. Thus, iPSC-derived MS models provide a unique platform for dissecting glial contributions to disease phenotypes independent of the peripheral immune system and identify potential glia-specific targets for therapeutic intervention.\nDistinct roles of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the macaque inferior temporal cortex in core object recognition behavior\nAuthors: Sanghavi, S.; Kar, K.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551579\nA spatially distributed population of neurons in the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex supports object recognition behavior, but the cell-type specificity of the population in forming \"behaviorally sufficient\" object decodes remain unclear. To address this, we recorded neural signals from the macaque IT cortex and compared the object identity information and the alignment of decoding strategies derived from putative inhibitory (Inh) and excitatory (Exc) neurons to the monkeys behavior. We observed that while Inh neurons represented significant category information, decoding strategies based on Exc neural population activity outperformed those from Inh neurons in overall accuracy and their image-level match to the monkeys behavioral reports. Interestingly, both Exc and Inh responses explained a fraction of unique variance of the monkeys behavior, demonstrating a distinct role of the two cell types in generating object identity solutions for a downstream readout. We observed that current artificial neural network (ANN) models of primate ventral stream, designed with AI goals of performance optimization on image categorization, better predict Exc neurons (and its contribution to object recognition behavior) than Inh neurons. Beyond, the refinement of linking propositions between IT and object recognition behavior, our results guide the development of more biologically constrained brain models by offering novel cell-type specific neural benchmarks.\nGeneralizable links between symptoms of borderline personality disorder and functional connectivity\nAuthors: Shafiei, G.; Keller, A. S.; Bertolero, M.; Shanmugan, S.; Bassett, D. S.; Chen, A. A.; Covitz, S.; Houghton, A.; Luo, A.; Mehta, K.; Salo, T.; Shinohara, R. T.; Fair, D.; Hallquist, M. N.; Satterthwaite, T. D.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551534\nBackgroundSymptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often manifest in adolescence, yet the underlying relationship between these debilitating symptoms and the development of functional brain networks is not well understood. Here we aimed to investigate how multivariate patterns of functional connectivity are associated with symptoms of BPD in a large sample of young adults and adolescents. MethodsWe used high-quality functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults from the Human Connectome Project: Young Adults (HCP-YA; N = 870, ages 22-37 years, 457 female) and youth from the Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D; N = 223, age range 16-21 years, 121 female). A previously validated BPD proxy score was derived from the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). A ridge regression model with 10-fold cross-validation and nested hyperparameter tuning was trained and tested in HCP-YA to predict BPD scores in unseen data from regional functional connectivity, while controlling for in-scanner motion, age, and sex. The trained model was further tested on data from HCP-D without further tuning. Finally, we tested how the connectivity patterns associated with BPD aligned with agerelated changes in connectivity. ResultsMultivariate functional connectivity patterns significantly predicted out-of-sample BPD proxy scores in unseen data in both young adults (HCP-YA; pperm = 0.001) and older adolescents (HCP-D; pperm = 0.001). Predictive capacity of regions was heterogeneous; the most predictive regions were found in functional systems relevant for emotion regulation and executive function, including the ventral attention network. Finally, regional functional connectivity patterns that predicted BPD proxy scores aligned with those associated with development in youth. ConclusionIndividual differences in functional connectivity in developmentally-sensitive regions are associated with the symptoms of BPD.\nAccelerated social representational drift in the nucleus accumbens in a model of autism\nAuthors: Zhao, P.; Chen, X.; Bellafard, A.; Murugesan, A.; Quan, J.; Aharoni, D.; Golshani, P.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552133\nImpaired social interaction is one of the core deficits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may result from social interactions being less rewarding. How the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as a key hub of reward circuitry, encodes social interaction and whether these representations are altered in ASD remain poorly understood. We identified NAc ensembles encoding social interactions by calcium imaging using miniaturized microscopy. NAc population activity, specifically D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) activity, predicted social interaction epochs. Despite a high turnover of NAc neurons modulated by social interaction, we found a stable population code for social interaction in NAc which was dramatically degraded in Cntnap2-/- mouse model of ASD. Surprisingly, non-specific optogenetic inhibition of NAc core neurons increased social interaction time and significantly improved sociability in Cntnap2-/- mice. Inhibition of D1- or D2-MSNs showed reciprocal effects, with D1 inhibition decreasing social interaction and D2 inhibition increasing interaction. Therefore, social interactions are preferentially, specifically and dynamically encoded by NAc neurons and social representations are degraded in this autism model.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">What constitutes a language? Natural languages share some features with other domains: from math, to music, to gesture. However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little or no response to diverse non-linguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages, or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and logic. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n=19 speakers)-- created to resemble natural languages--and fictional conlangs (Klingon (n=10), Navi (n=9), High Valyrian (n=3), and Dothraki (n=3)), created to differ from natural languages, and suggests that conlangs and natural languages share critical features and that the notable differences between conlangs and natural language are not consequential for the cognitive and neural mechanisms that they engage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysregulated microglia activation, leading to neuroinflammation, is crucial in neurodegenerative disease development and progression. The initial M1/M2 dual activation classification for microglia is outdated. Even the  disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype, firstly described in mice, falls short in representing the diverse microglia phenotypes in pathology. In this study, we have constructed a transcriptomic atlas of human brain immune cells by integrating single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq datasets from multiple neurodegenerative conditions. Sixteen datasets were included, comprising 295 samples from patients with Alzheimers disease, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body diseases, COVID-19, and healthy controls. The integrated Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) dataset included 60,557 nuclei and revealed 11 microglial subpopulations distributed across all pathological and healthy conditions. Among these, we identified four different homeostatic clusters as well as pathological phenotypes. These included two stages of early and late activation of the DAM phenotype and the disease-inflammatory macrophage (DIM) phenotype, which was recently described in mice, and is also present in human microglia, as indicated by our analysis. The high versatility of microglia is evident through changes in subset distribution across various pathologies, suggesting their contribution in shaping pathological phenotypes. Our analysis showed overall depletion of four substates of homeostatic microglia, and expansion of niche subpopulations within the DAM and DIM spectrum across distinct neurodegenerative pathologies. The HuMicA is invaluable in advancing the study of microglia biology in both healthy and disease settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Visual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritized for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Here, we used MEG in combination with Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to understand the neural correlates of feature-guided visual search. RIFT served as a continuous read-out of the neuronal excitability to the search stimuli and revealed evidence for target boosting and distractor suppression in early visual cortex. These findings were complemented by an increase in occipital alpha power predicting faster responses and higher hit rates, as well as reduced RIFT responses to all stimuli, regardless of their task-relevance. We propose that alpha oscillations in early visual regions implement a blanket inhibition that reduces neuronal excitability to both target and distractor features. As the excitability of neurons encoding the target features is boosted, these neurons overcome the inhibition, facilitating guidance towards task-relevant stimuli. Our results provide novel insights on a mechanism in early visual regions that supports selective attention through inhibition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding neural processes such as memory formation, learning, or aging requires tracking the activity of neural populations across short and long time scales. Such longitudinal recordings can be achieved with chronically implanted Neuropixels probes. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in small animals like mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. In this initial preprint, we present the &#34;Apollo Implant&#34;, an open-source and editable device that meets all these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The assembled implant comprises two modules: a recoverable &#34;payload&#34; module, and a &#34;docking&#34; module that is cemented to the skull. The design is readily adjustable: the distance between probes, angle of insertion, and depth of penetration can all be easily changed. We tested the implant across multiple labs, and in head-fixed and freely moving animals. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant thus provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Modular and distributed theories of category selectivity along the ventral visual stream have long existed in tension. Here, we present a reconciling framework, based on a series of analyses relating category-selective tuning within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, visual category-selective tuning naturally emerges for classic categories of faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits. Finally, these pre-identified units from a single model can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of the human visual system, even under a constrained sparse-positive encoding procedure. The success of this model indicates that the nature of category-selective tuning in the human brain (e.g. for faces or scenes) is dependent on the learning diet, and best understood in the context of the full scope of experienced visual input. Broadly, we offer a unifying theoretical account where category-selective tuning naturally emerges as a consequence of positive information routing through hierarchical population codes, in order to disentangle the statistics of visual experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, typically resulting in significant neurological disability that worsens over time. While considerable progress has been made in defining the immune systems role in MS pathophysiology, the contribution of intrinsic CNS-cell dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we generated the largest reported collection of iPSC lines from people with MS spanning diverse clinical subtypes and differentiated them into glia-enriched cultures. Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we observed several distinguishing characteristics of MS cultures pointing to glia-intrinsic disease mechanisms. We found that iPSC-derived cultures from people with primary progressive MS contained fewer oligodendrocytes. Moreover, iPSC-oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes from people with MS showed increased expression of immune and inflammatory genes that match those of glial cells from MS postmortem brains. Thus, iPSC-derived MS models provide a unique platform for dissecting glial contributions to disease phenotypes independent of the peripheral immune system and identify potential glia-specific targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A spatially distributed population of neurons in the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex supports object recognition behavior, but the cell-type specificity of the population in forming &#34;behaviorally sufficient&#34; object decodes remain unclear. To address this, we recorded neural signals from the macaque IT cortex and compared the object identity information and the alignment of decoding strategies derived from putative inhibitory (Inh) and excitatory (Exc) neurons to the monkeys behavior. We observed that while Inh neurons represented significant category information, decoding strategies based on Exc neural population activity outperformed those from Inh neurons in overall accuracy and their image-level match to the monkeys behavioral reports. Interestingly, both Exc and Inh responses explained a fraction of unique variance of the monkeys behavior, demonstrating a distinct role of the two cell types in generating object identity solutions for a downstream readout. We observed that current artificial neural network (ANN) models of primate ventral stream, designed with AI goals of performance optimization on image categorization, better predict Exc neurons (and its contribution to object recognition behavior) than Inh neurons. Beyond, the refinement of linking propositions between IT and object recognition behavior, our results guide the development of more biologically constrained brain models by offering novel cell-type specific neural benchmarks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSymptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often manifest in adolescence, yet the underlying relationship between these debilitating symptoms and the development of functional brain networks is not well understood. Here we aimed to investigate how multivariate patterns of functional connectivity are associated with symptoms of BPD in a large sample of young adults and adolescents.

MethodsWe used high-quality functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults from the Human Connectome Project: Young Adults (HCP-YA; N = 870, ages 22-37 years, 457 female) and youth from the Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D; N = 223, age range 16-21 years, 121 female). A previously validated BPD proxy score was derived from the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). A ridge regression model with 10-fold cross-validation and nested hyperparameter tuning was trained and tested in HCP-YA to predict BPD scores in unseen data from regional functional connectivity, while controlling for in-scanner motion, age, and sex. The trained model was further tested on data from HCP-D without further tuning. Finally, we tested how the connectivity patterns associated with BPD aligned with agerelated changes in connectivity.

ResultsMultivariate functional connectivity patterns significantly predicted out-of-sample BPD proxy scores in unseen data in both young adults (HCP-YA; pperm = 0.001) and older adolescents (HCP-D; pperm = 0.001). Predictive capacity of regions was heterogeneous; the most predictive regions were found in functional systems relevant for emotion regulation and executive function, including the ventral attention network. Finally, regional functional connectivity patterns that predicted BPD proxy scores aligned with those associated with development in youth.

ConclusionIndividual differences in functional connectivity in developmentally-sensitive regions are associated with the symptoms of BPD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Impaired social interaction is one of the core deficits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may result from social interactions being less rewarding. How the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as a key hub of reward circuitry, encodes social interaction and whether these representations are altered in ASD remain poorly understood. We identified NAc ensembles encoding social interactions by calcium imaging using miniaturized microscopy. NAc population activity, specifically D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) activity, predicted social interaction epochs. Despite a high turnover of NAc neurons modulated by social interaction, we found a stable population code for social interaction in NAc which was dramatically degraded in Cntnap2-/- mouse model of ASD. Surprisingly, non-specific optogenetic inhibition of NAc core neurons increased social interaction time and significantly improved sociability in Cntnap2-/- mice. Inhibition of D1- or D2-MSNs showed reciprocal effects, with D1 inhibition decreasing social interaction and D2 inhibition increasing interaction. Therefore, social interactions are preferentially, specifically and dynamically encoded by NAc neurons and social representations are degraded in this autism model.</p>
