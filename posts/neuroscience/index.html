F.; Brusaferri, L.; Kim, M.; Saadi, D.; Ratai, E.-M.; Dougherty, D. D.; Loggia, M. L.\nScore: 1039.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563117\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.\nCaveolin-1 mediates neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Trevino, T. N.; Fogel, A. B.; Minshall, R.; Richner, J. M.; Lutz, S. E.\nScore: 191.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.563024\nLeukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3+ T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.\nMenstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and grey matter architecture changes across the whole brain\nAuthors: Rizor, E. J.; Babenko, V.; Dundon, N. M.; Beverly-Aylwin, R.; Stump, A.; Hayes, M.; Herschenfeld-Catalan, L.; Jacobs, E. G.; Grafton, S. T.\nScore: 283.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561616\nCyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.\nDevelopment of neural circuits for social motion perception in schooling fish\nAuthors: Zada, D.; Schulze, L.; Yu, J.-H.; Tarabishi, P.; Napoli, J. L.; Lovett-Barron, M.\nScore: 46.7, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563839\nMany animals move in groups, where collective behavior emerges from the interactions amongst individuals. These social interactions produce the coordinated movements of bird flocks and fish schools, but little is known about their developmental emergence and neurobiological foundations. By characterizing the visually-based schooling behavior of the micro glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we found that social development progresses sequentially, with animals first acquiring the ability to aggregate, followed by postural alignment with social partners. This social maturation was accompanied by the development of neural populations in the midbrain and forebrain that were preferentially driven by visual stimuli that resemble the shape and movements of schooling fish. The development of these neural circuits enables the social coordination required for collective movement.\nPresynaptic inhibition selectively suppresses leg proprioception in behaving Drosophila\nAuthors: Dallmann, C. J.; Agrawal, S.; Cook, A.; Brunton, B. W.; Tuthill, J. C.\nScore: 45.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563322\nThe sense of proprioception is mediated by internal mechanosensory neurons that detect joint position and movement. To support a diverse range of functions, from stabilizing posture to coordinating movements, proprioceptive feedback to limb motor control circuits must be tuned in a context-dependent manner. How proprioceptive feedback signals are tuned to match behavioral demands remains poorly understood. Using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons of movementencoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons are active during self-generated but not passive leg movements and receive input from descending neurons, suggesting they are driven by predictions of leg movement originating in the brain. Predictively suppressing expected proprioceptive feedback provides a mechanism to attenuate reflexes that would otherwise interfere with voluntary movement.\nThe biological role of local and global fMRI BOLD signal variability in human brain organization\nAuthors: Baracchini, G.; Zhou, Y.; Castanheira, J. d. S.; Hansen, J. Y.; Rieck, J. R.; Turner, G. R.; Grady, C. L.; Misic, B.; Nomi, J.; Uddin, L. Q.; Spreng, R. N.\nScore: 45.6, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563476\nVariability drives the organization and behavior of complex systems, including the human brain. Understanding the variability of brain signals is thus necessary to broaden our window into brain function and behavior. Few empirical investigations of macroscale brain signal variability have yet been undertaken, given the difficulty in separating biological sources of variance from artefactual noise. Here, we characterize the temporal variability of the most predominant macroscale brain signal, the fMRI BOLD signal, and systematically investigate its statistical, topographical and neurobiological properties. We contrast fMRI acquisition protocols, and integrate across histology, microstructure, transcriptomics, neurotransmitter receptor and metabolic data, fMRI static connectivity, and empirical and simulated magnetoencephalography data. We show that BOLD signal variability represents a spatially heterogeneous, central property of multi-scale multi-modal brain organization, distinct from noise. Our work establishes the biological relevance of BOLD signal variability and provides a lens on brain stochasticity across spatial and temporal scales.\nNeural signatures of stress susceptibility and resilience in the amygdala-hippocampal network\nAuthors: Xia, F.; Fascianelli, V.; Vishwakarma, N.; Ghinger, F. G.; Fusi, S.; Kheirbek, M.\nScore: 43.5, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563652\nThe neural dynamics that underlie divergent anhedonic responses to stress remain unclear. Here, we identified neuronal dynamics in an amygdala-hippocampal circuit that distinguish stress resilience and susceptibility. In a reward-choice task, basolateral amygdala (BLA) activity in resilient mice showed enhanced discrimination of upcoming reward choices. In contrast, a rumination-like signature emerged in the BLA of susceptible mice; a linear decoder could classify the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Spontaneous activity in the BLA of susceptible mice was higher dimensional than controls, reflecting the exploration of a larger number of distinct neural states. Manipulation of vCA1-BLA inputs rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics and anhedonia in susceptible mice, suggesting that targeting this pathway can enhance BLA circuit function and ameliorate of depression-related behaviors. One-Sentence SummaryIdentification and rescue of dysfunctional vCA1-BLA population dynamics and behavior in stress-susceptible mice.\nThe Synaptic Architecture of Layer 5 Thick Tufted Excitatory Neurons in the Visual Cortex of Mice\nAuthors: Bodor, A.

Composed of repeated modules, or microcircuits, the neocortex relies on distinct cell types as its fundamental building blocks. Despite significant progress in characterizing these cell types 1-5, an understanding of the complete synaptic partners associated with individual excitatory cell types remain elusive. Here, we investigate the connectivity of arguably the most well recognized and studied excitatory neuron in the neocortex: the thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal cell 6-10 also known as extra telencephalic (ET) 11 neurons. Although the synaptic interactions of ET neurons have been extensively explored, a comprehensive characterization of their local connectivity remains lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged a 1 mm3 electron microscopic (EM) dataset. We found that ET neurons primarily establish connections with inhibitory cells in their immediate vicinity. However, when they extend their axons to other cortical regions, they tend to connect more with excitatory cells. We also find that the inhibitory cells targeted by ET neurons are a specific group of cell types, and they preferentially inhibit ET cells. Finally, we observed that the most common excitatory targets of ET neurons are layer 5 IT neurons and layer 6 pyramidal cells, whereas synapses with other ET neurons are not as common. These findings challenge current views of the connectivity of ET neurons and suggest a circuit design that involves local competition among ET neurons and collaboration with other types of excitatory cells. Our results also highlight a specific circuit pattern where a subclass of excitatory cells forms a network with specific inhibitory cell types, offering a framework for exploring the connectivity of other types of excitatory cells.\nEffects of non-retinal inputs in visual thalamus depend on visual responsiveness and stimulus context\nAuthors: Schmors, L.; Kotkat, A.; Bauer, Y.; Huang, Z.; Crombie, D.; Meyerolbersleben, L.; Sokoloski, S.; Berens, P.; Busse, L.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562960\nIn the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, retinal signals are combined with non-retinal inputs such as corticothalamic (CT) feedback and behavioural state. How these shape dLGN activity remains an open question. We recorded extracellular responses in dLGN of awake mice to a movie stimulus, while photosuppressing CT feedback, tracking locomotion and pupil size. To assess the relative impact of retinal and non-retinal inputs, we fit single neuron responses using generalized linear models. While including CT feedback and behavioural state as predictors significantly improved the models overall performance, the improvement was especially pronounced for a sub-population of poorly visually responsive neurons. In addition, the impact of CT feedback was faster and more prevalent in the absence of a patterned visual stimulus. Finally, for CT feedback-sensitive dLGN neurons, visual stimuli could be discriminated better when CT feedback was suppressed. Together, these results show that effects of non-retinal inputs in dLGN depend on visual responsiveness and stimulus context.\nTranslating electrophysiological signatures of awareness into thalamocortical mechanisms by inverting systems-level computational models across arousal states\nAuthors: Medel, V.; Muller, E. J.; Munn, B. R.; Casey, C.; Sanders, R. D.; Shine, J. M.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561970\nWhile consciousness never fades during wakefulness, there is a paradoxical coexistence of consciousness during dreaming states. Its also possible for sensory awareness to be either present or absent when awakened from seemingly-identical states of sedation and anaesthesia. Traditionally, these states have been characterised in terms of their electroencephalographic neural correlates, however, without clear underlying neurobiological mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we invert a validated neural mass model of the corticothalamic system using scalp EEG collected during nonlinear transitions in conscious experience and sensory awareness across varying depths of dexmedetomidine sedation. We found that a decline in conscious experience and sensory awareness with dexmedetomidine was associated with a decrease in the engagement of excitatory thalamocortical loop resonances, along with an increase in inhibitory intrathalamic loop gains. These findings shed light into the neural mechanisms of conscious experience and sensory awareness, and explain how it fades across arousal states, bridging the gap between the neural correlates of consciousness and its underlying systems-level thalamocortical mechanisms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3&#43; T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many animals move in groups, where collective behavior emerges from the interactions amongst individuals. These social interactions produce the coordinated movements of bird flocks and fish schools, but little is known about their developmental emergence and neurobiological foundations. By characterizing the visually-based schooling behavior of the micro glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we found that social development progresses sequentially, with animals first acquiring the ability to aggregate, followed by postural alignment with social partners. This social maturation was accompanied by the development of neural populations in the midbrain and forebrain that were preferentially driven by visual stimuli that resemble the shape and movements of schooling fish. The development of these neural circuits enables the social coordination required for collective movement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The sense of proprioception is mediated by internal mechanosensory neurons that detect joint position and movement. To support a diverse range of functions, from stabilizing posture to coordinating movements, proprioceptive feedback to limb motor control circuits must be tuned in a context-dependent manner. How proprioceptive feedback signals are tuned to match behavioral demands remains poorly understood. Using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons of movementencoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons are active during self-generated but not passive leg movements and receive input from descending neurons, suggesting they are driven by predictions of leg movement originating in the brain. Predictively suppressing expected proprioceptive feedback provides a mechanism to attenuate reflexes that would otherwise interfere with voluntary movement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Variability drives the organization and behavior of complex systems, including the human brain. Understanding the variability of brain signals is thus necessary to broaden our window into brain function and behavior. Few empirical investigations of macroscale brain signal variability have yet been undertaken, given the difficulty in separating biological sources of variance from artefactual noise. Here, we characterize the temporal variability of the most predominant macroscale brain signal, the fMRI BOLD signal, and systematically investigate its statistical, topographical and neurobiological properties. We contrast fMRI acquisition protocols, and integrate across histology, microstructure, transcriptomics, neurotransmitter receptor and metabolic data, fMRI static connectivity, and empirical and simulated magnetoencephalography data. We show that BOLD signal variability represents a spatially heterogeneous, central property of multi-scale multi-modal brain organization, distinct from noise. Our work establishes the biological relevance of BOLD signal variability and provides a lens on brain stochasticity across spatial and temporal scales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neural dynamics that underlie divergent anhedonic responses to stress remain unclear. Here, we identified neuronal dynamics in an amygdala-hippocampal circuit that distinguish stress resilience and susceptibility. In a reward-choice task, basolateral amygdala (BLA) activity in resilient mice showed enhanced discrimination of upcoming reward choices. In contrast, a rumination-like signature emerged in the BLA of susceptible mice; a linear decoder could classify the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Spontaneous activity in the BLA of susceptible mice was higher dimensional than controls, reflecting the exploration of a larger number of distinct neural states. Manipulation of vCA1-BLA inputs rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics and anhedonia in susceptible mice, suggesting that targeting this pathway can enhance BLA circuit function and ameliorate of depression-related behaviors.

        <p class="abstract">The neocortex is one of the most critical structures that makes us human, and it is involved in a variety of cognitive functions from perception to sensory integration and motor control. Composed of repeated modules, or microcircuits, the neocortex relies on distinct cell types as its fundamental building blocks. Despite significant progress in characterizing these cell types 1-5, an understanding of the complete synaptic partners associated with individual excitatory cell types remain elusive.

Here, we investigate the connectivity of arguably the most well recognized and studied excitatory neuron in the neocortex: the thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal cell 6-10 also known as extra telencephalic (ET) 11 neurons. Although the synaptic interactions of ET neurons have been extensively explored, a comprehensive characterization of their local connectivity remains lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged a 1 mm3 electron microscopic (EM) dataset.

We found that ET neurons primarily establish connections with inhibitory cells in their immediate vicinity. However, when they extend their axons to other cortical regions, they tend to connect more with excitatory cells. We also find that the inhibitory cells targeted by ET neurons are a specific group of cell types, and they preferentially inhibit ET cells. Finally, we observed that the most common excitatory targets of ET neurons are layer 5 IT neurons and layer 6 pyramidal cells, whereas synapses with other ET neurons are not as common.

These findings challenge current views of the connectivity of ET neurons and suggest a circuit design that involves local competition among ET neurons and collaboration with other types of excitatory cells. Our results also highlight a specific circuit pattern where a subclass of excitatory cells forms a network with specific inhibitory cell types, offering a framework for exploring the connectivity of other types of excitatory cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, retinal signals are combined with non-retinal inputs such as corticothalamic (CT) feedback and behavioural state. How these shape dLGN activity remains an open question. We recorded extracellular responses in dLGN of awake mice to a movie stimulus, while photosuppressing CT feedback, tracking locomotion and pupil size. To assess the relative impact of retinal and non-retinal inputs, we fit single neuron responses using generalized linear models. While including CT feedback and behavioural state as predictors significantly improved the models overall performance, the improvement was especially pronounced for a sub-population of poorly visually responsive neurons. In addition, the impact of CT feedback was faster and more prevalent in the absence of a patterned visual stimulus. Finally, for CT feedback-sensitive dLGN neurons, visual stimuli could be discriminated better when CT feedback was suppressed. Together, these results show that effects of non-retinal inputs in dLGN depend on visual responsiveness and stimulus context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While consciousness never fades during wakefulness, there is a paradoxical coexistence of consciousness during dreaming states. Its also possible for sensory awareness to be either present or absent when awakened from seemingly-identical states of sedation and anaesthesia. Traditionally, these states have been characterised in terms of their electroencephalographic neural correlates, however, without clear underlying neurobiological mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we invert a validated neural mass model of the corticothalamic system using scalp EEG collected during nonlinear transitions in conscious experience and sensory awareness across varying depths of dexmedetomidine sedation. We found that a decline in conscious experience and sensory awareness with dexmedetomidine was associated with a decrease in the engagement of excitatory thalamocortical loop resonances, along with an increase in inhibitory intrathalamic loop gains. These findings shed light into the neural mechanisms of conscious experience and sensory awareness, and explain how it fades across arousal states, bridging the gap between the neural correlates of consciousness and its underlying systems-level thalamocortical mechanisms.</p>
