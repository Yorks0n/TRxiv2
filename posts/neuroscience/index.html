  "articleBody": " Functional imaging of nine distinct neuronal populations under a miniscope in freely behaving animals\nAuthors: Phillips, M. L.; Urban, N. T.; Salemi, T.; Dong, Z.; Yasuda, R.\nScore: 141.3, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571122\nHead-mounted miniscopes have allowed for functional fluorescence imaging in freely moving animals. However, current capabilities of state-of-the-art technology can record only up to two, spectrally distinct fluorophores. This severely limits the number of cell types identifiable in a functional imaging experiment. Here we present a pipeline that enables the distinction of nine neuronal subtypes from regions defined by behaviorally relevant cells during in vivo GCaMP imaging. These subtypes are identified utilizing unique fluorophores that are co-expressed with GCaMP, unmixed by spectral imaging on a confocal microscope and co-registering these spectral fingerprints with functional data obtained on miniaturized microscopes. This method facilitates detailed analyses of circuit-level encoding of behavior.\nBrain-wide topographic coordination of traveling spiral waves\nAuthors: Ye, Z.; Bull, M. S.; Li, A.; Birman, D.; Daigle, T. L.; Tasic, B.; Zeng, H.; Steinmetz, N. A.\nScore: 89.6, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570517\nTraveling waves of activity are a prevalent phenomenon within neural networks of diverse brain regions and species1-4, and have been implicated in myriad brain functions including sensory perception5-8, memory9, spatial navigation10-12 and motor control13,14. However, the anatomical basis for these waves, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we use cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. Finally, at the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are structured by axonal pathways and globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems.\nStable Cortical Body Maps Before and After Arm Amputation\nAuthors: Schone, H. R.; Maimon-Mor, R. O.; Kollamkulam, M. T.; Gerrand, C.; Woollard, A.; Kang, N. V.; Baker, C. I.; Makin, T. R.\nScore: 72.8, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571314\nNeuroscientists have long debated the adult brains capacity to reorganize itself in response to injury. A driving model for studying plasticity has been limb amputation. For decades, it was believed that amputation triggers large-scale reorganization of cortical body resources. However, these studies have relied on cross-sectional observations post-amputation, without directly tracking neural changes. Here, we longitudinally followed adult patients with planned arm amputations and measured hand and face representations, before and after amputation. By interrogating the representational structure elicited from movements of the hand (pre-amputation) and phantom hand (post-amputation), we demonstrate that hand representation is unaltered. Further, we observed no evidence for lower face (lip) reorganization into the deprived hand region. Collectively, our findings provide direct and decisive evidence that amputation does not trigger large-scale cortical reorganization.\nStriatal dopamine reflects individual long-term learning trajectories\nAuthors: Liebana Garcia, S.; Laffere, A.; Toschi, C.; Schilling, L.; Podlaski, J.; Fritsche, M.; Zatka-Haas, P.; Li, Y.; Bogacz, R.; Saxe, A.; Lak, A.\nScore: 34.0, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571653\nLearning from naive to expert occurs over long periods of time, accompanied by changes in the brains neuronal signals. The principles governing behavioural and neuronal dynamics during long-term learning remain unknown. We developed a psychophysical visual decision task for mice that allowed for studying learning trajectories from naive to expert. Mice adopted sequences of strategies that became more stimulus-dependent over time, showing substantial diversity in the strategies they transitioned through and settled on. Remarkably, these transitions were systematic; the initial strategy of naive mice predicted their strategy several weeks later. Longitudinal imaging of dopamine release in dorsal striatum demonstrated that dopamine signals evolved over learning, reflecting stimulus-choice associations linked to each individuals strategy. A deep neural network model trained on the task with reinforcement learning captured behavioural and dopamine trajectories. The models learning dynamics accounted for the mices diverse and systematic learning trajectories through a hierarchy of saddle points. The model used prediction errors mirroring recorded dopamine signals to update its parameters, offering a concrete account of striatal dopamines role in long-term learning. Our results demonstrate that long-term learning is governed by diverse yet systematic transitions through behavioural strategies, and that dopamine signals exhibit key characteristics to support this learning.\nThe molecular basis of sugar detection by an insect taste receptor\nAuthors: Gomes, J. V. T.; Singh-Bhagania, S.; Cenci, M.; Cordon, C. C.; Singh, M.; Butterwick, J. A.\nScore: 33.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572227\nAnimals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules. To gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, D-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how specificity for D-fructose is seemingly achieved by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in D-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We identified the conformational change required to open the channel gate that provides an additional layer of receptor tuning in BmGr9; only D-fructose can both fit into the pocket and simultaneously engage a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the ion conducting pore. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor-ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction.\nPsilocybin prevents activity-based anorexia in female rats by enhancing cognitive flexibility: contributions from 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mechanisms.\nAuthors: Conn, K.; Milton, L. K.; Huang, K.; Munguba, H.; Ruuska, J.; Lemus, M. B.; Greaves, E.; Homman-Ludiye, J.; Oldfield, B. J.; Foldi, C. J.\nScore: 28.3, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571374\nPsilocybin has shown promise for alleviating symptoms of depression and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN), a condition that is characterised by persistent cognitive inflexibility. Considering that enhanced cognitive flexibility after psilocybin treatment is reported to occur in individuals with depression, it is plausible that psilocybin could improve symptoms of AN by breaking down cognitive inflexibility. A mechanistic understanding of the actions of psilocybin is required to tailor the clinical application of psilocybin to individuals most likely to respond with positive outcomes. This can only be achieved using incisive neurobiological approaches in animal models. Here, we use the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model and comprehensively assess aspects of reinforcement learning to show that psilocybin (post-acutely) improves body weight maintenance in female rats and facilitates cognitive flexibility, specifically via improved adaptation to the initial reversal of reward contingencies. Further, we reveal the involvement of signalling through the serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in specific aspects of learning, demonstrating that 5-HT1A antagonism negates the cognitive enhancing effects of psilocybin. Moreover, we show that psilocybin elicits a transient increase and decrease in cortical transcription of these receptors (Htr2a and Htr1a, respectively), and a further reduction in the abundance of Htr2a transcripts in rats exposed to the ABA model. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that psilocybin could ameliorate cognitive inflexibility in the context of AN and highlight a need to better understand the therapeutic mechanisms independent of 5-HT2A receptor binding.\nMemory reactivation during sleep does not act holistically on object memory\nAuthors: Siefert, E. M.; Uppuluri, S.; Mu, J.; Tandoc, M. C.; Antony, J. W.; Schapiro, A. C.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571683\nMemory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation process where some features are enhanced over others.\nLocus Coeruleus Norepinephrine Neurons Facilitate Orbitofrontal Cortex Remapping and Behavioral Flexibility\nAuthors: Ogg, M. C.; Franks, H. T.; Lansdell, B. J.; Hughes, A. C.; Lee, J.; Nolen, H. G.; Shirinifard, A.; Lindsay, S.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571858\nTo guide behavior, brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) retain complex information about current tasks and expected outcomes in cellular representations referred to as cognitive maps. When actions produce undesirable results, OFC cognitive maps must update to promote behavioral change. Here, we show that this remapping is driven by the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus that contains most of the brains norepinephrine (NE)-releasing neurons. In a task that tests behavioral flexibility in rodents, LC-NE activity correlated with task acuity and altered depending on trial outcome. Silencing LC neurons caused perseverative behavior and impeded cognitive remapping in OFC, while enhancing LC activity disrupted the ability of new maps to stabilize. These findings reveal a novel role for bidirectional LC-NE signaling in regulation of OFC cognitive map stability and promotion of flexible behavior that differs from the traditional function of this circuit as a global arousal signal.\nDDHD2 is necessary for activity-driven fatty acid fueling of nerve terminal function\nAuthors: Kumar, M.; Wu, Y.; Knapp, J.; Park, D.; Gupta, K.; De Camilli, P.; Ryan, T. A.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572201\nHSP54, a hereditary spastic paraplegia associated with cognitive impairment, is caused by mutations in the neuron-specific triglyceride (TG) lipase DDHD2. Loss of DDHD2 function results in lipid accumulation in human brains1 and lipid droplets (LDs) in mouse neurons2. In metabolically demanding tissues, TG lipases generate a fatty acid (FA) flux from LDs to fuel mitochondrial ATP production, but neurons are considered unable to use fat as an energy source. Thus, the basis for cognitive impairment driven by DDHD2 loss remains enigmatic. To resolve this paradox, we took advantage of presynaptic sensitivity to metabolic perturbations to determine if FAs derived from LDs could power local {beta}-oxidation to support synaptic functions and whether DDHD2 activity would be required in the process. We demonstrate that nerve terminals are enriched with DDHD2 and blocking its activity leads to presynaptic accumulation of LDs. Moreover, we show that FAs derived from axonal LDs enter mitochondria in an activity-dependent fashion and drive local mitochondrial ATP production allowing nerve terminals to sustain function in the complete absence of glucose. Our data demonstrate that neurons and their nerve terminals can make use of LDs during electrical activity to provide metabolic support when glucose is in short supply.\nKnowing what you don't know: Estimating the uncertainty of feedforward and feedback inputs with prediction-error circuits\nAuthors: Hertag, L.; Wilmes, K. A.; Clopath, C.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571410\nAt any moment, our brains receive a stream of sensory stimuli arising from the world we interact with. Simultaneously, neural circuits are shaped by feedback signals carrying predictions about the same inputs we experience. Those feedforward and feedback inputs often do not perfectly match. Thus, our brains have the challenging task of integrating these conflicting streams of information according to their reliabilities. However, how neural circuits keep track of both the stimulus and prediction uncertainty is not well understood. Here, we propose a network model whose core is a hierarchical prediction-error circuit. We show that our network can estimate the variance of the sensory stimuli and the uncertainty of the prediction using the activity of negative and positive prediction-error neurons. In line with previous hypotheses, we demonstrate that neural circuits rely strongly on feedback predictions if the perceived stimuli are noisy and the underlying generative process, that is, the environment is stable. Moreover, we show that predictions modulate neural activity at the onset of a new stimulus, even if this sensory information is reliable. In our network, the uncertainty estimation, and, hence, how much we rely on predictions, can be influenced by perturbing the intricate interplay of different inhibitory interneurons. We, therefore, investigate the contribution of those inhibitory interneurons to the weighting of feedforward and feedback inputs. Finally, we show that our network can be linked to biased perception and unravel how stimulus and prediction uncertainty contribute to the contraction bias.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Head-mounted miniscopes have allowed for functional fluorescence imaging in freely moving animals. However, current capabilities of state-of-the-art technology can record only up to two, spectrally distinct fluorophores. This severely limits the number of cell types identifiable in a functional imaging experiment. Here we present a pipeline that enables the distinction of nine neuronal subtypes from regions defined by behaviorally relevant cells during in vivo GCaMP imaging. These subtypes are identified utilizing unique fluorophores that are co-expressed with GCaMP, unmixed by spectral imaging on a confocal microscope and co-registering these spectral fingerprints with functional data obtained on miniaturized microscopes. This method facilitates detailed analyses of circuit-level encoding of behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traveling waves of activity are a prevalent phenomenon within neural networks of diverse brain regions and species1-4, and have been implicated in myriad brain functions including sensory perception5-8, memory9, spatial navigation10-12 and motor control13,14. However, the anatomical basis for these waves, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we use cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. Finally, at the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are structured by axonal pathways and globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroscientists have long debated the adult brains capacity to reorganize itself in response to injury. A driving model for studying plasticity has been limb amputation. For decades, it was believed that amputation triggers large-scale reorganization of cortical body resources. However, these studies have relied on cross-sectional observations post-amputation, without directly tracking neural changes. Here, we longitudinally followed adult patients with planned arm amputations and measured hand and face representations, before and after amputation. By interrogating the representational structure elicited from movements of the hand (pre-amputation) and phantom hand (post-amputation), we demonstrate that hand representation is unaltered. Further, we observed no evidence for lower face (lip) reorganization into the deprived hand region. Collectively, our findings provide direct and decisive evidence that amputation does not trigger large-scale cortical reorganization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning from naive to expert occurs over long periods of time, accompanied by changes in the brains neuronal signals. The principles governing behavioural and neuronal dynamics during long-term learning remain unknown. We developed a psychophysical visual decision task for mice that allowed for studying learning trajectories from naive to expert. Mice adopted sequences of strategies that became more stimulus-dependent over time, showing substantial diversity in the strategies they transitioned through and settled on. Remarkably, these transitions were systematic; the initial strategy of naive mice predicted their strategy several weeks later. Longitudinal imaging of dopamine release in dorsal striatum demonstrated that dopamine signals evolved over learning, reflecting stimulus-choice associations linked to each individuals strategy. A deep neural network model trained on the task with reinforcement learning captured behavioural and dopamine trajectories. The models learning dynamics accounted for the mices diverse and systematic learning trajectories through a hierarchy of saddle points. The model used prediction errors mirroring recorded dopamine signals to update its parameters, offering a concrete account of striatal dopamines role in long-term learning. Our results demonstrate that long-term learning is governed by diverse yet systematic transitions through behavioural strategies, and that dopamine signals exhibit key characteristics to support this learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules. To gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, D-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how specificity for D-fructose is seemingly achieved by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in D-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We identified the conformational change required to open the channel gate that provides an additional layer of receptor tuning in BmGr9; only D-fructose can both fit into the pocket and simultaneously engage a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the ion conducting pore. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor-ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psilocybin has shown promise for alleviating symptoms of depression and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN), a condition that is characterised by persistent cognitive inflexibility. Considering that enhanced cognitive flexibility after psilocybin treatment is reported to occur in individuals with depression, it is plausible that psilocybin could improve symptoms of AN by breaking down cognitive inflexibility. A mechanistic understanding of the actions of psilocybin is required to tailor the clinical application of psilocybin to individuals most likely to respond with positive outcomes. This can only be achieved using incisive neurobiological approaches in animal models. Here, we use the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model and comprehensively assess aspects of reinforcement learning to show that psilocybin (post-acutely) improves body weight maintenance in female rats and facilitates cognitive flexibility, specifically via improved adaptation to the initial reversal of reward contingencies. Further, we reveal the involvement of signalling through the serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in specific aspects of learning, demonstrating that 5-HT1A antagonism negates the cognitive enhancing effects of psilocybin. Moreover, we show that psilocybin elicits a transient increase and decrease in cortical transcription of these receptors (Htr2a and Htr1a, respectively), and a further reduction in the abundance of Htr2a transcripts in rats exposed to the ABA model. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that psilocybin could ameliorate cognitive inflexibility in the context of AN and highlight a need to better understand the therapeutic mechanisms independent of 5-HT2A receptor binding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation process where some features are enhanced over others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To guide behavior, brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) retain complex information about current tasks and expected outcomes in cellular representations referred to as cognitive maps. When actions produce undesirable results, OFC cognitive maps must update to promote behavioral change. Here, we show that this remapping is driven by the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus that contains most of the brains norepinephrine (NE)-releasing neurons. In a task that tests behavioral flexibility in rodents, LC-NE activity correlated with task acuity and altered depending on trial outcome. Silencing LC neurons caused perseverative behavior and impeded cognitive remapping in OFC, while enhancing LC activity disrupted the ability of new maps to stabilize. These findings reveal a novel role for bidirectional LC-NE signaling in regulation of OFC cognitive map stability and promotion of flexible behavior that differs from the traditional function of this circuit as a global arousal signal.</p>

        <p class="abstract">HSP54, a hereditary spastic paraplegia associated with cognitive impairment, is caused by mutations in the neuron-specific triglyceride (TG) lipase DDHD2. Loss of DDHD2 function results in lipid accumulation in human brains1 and lipid droplets (LDs) in mouse neurons2. In metabolically demanding tissues, TG lipases generate a fatty acid (FA) flux from LDs to fuel mitochondrial ATP production, but neurons are considered unable to use fat as an energy source. Thus, the basis for cognitive impairment driven by DDHD2 loss remains enigmatic. To resolve this paradox, we took advantage of presynaptic sensitivity to metabolic perturbations to determine if FAs derived from LDs could power local {beta}-oxidation to support synaptic functions and whether DDHD2 activity would be required in the process. We demonstrate that nerve terminals are enriched with DDHD2 and blocking its activity leads to presynaptic accumulation of LDs. Moreover, we show that FAs derived from axonal LDs enter mitochondria in an activity-dependent fashion and drive local mitochondrial ATP production allowing nerve terminals to sustain function in the complete absence of glucose. Our data demonstrate that neurons and their nerve terminals can make use of LDs during electrical activity to provide metabolic support when glucose is in short supply.</p>

        <p class="abstract">At any moment, our brains receive a stream of sensory stimuli arising from the world we interact with. Simultaneously, neural circuits are shaped by feedback signals carrying predictions about the same inputs we experience. Those feedforward and feedback inputs often do not perfectly match. Thus, our brains have the challenging task of integrating these conflicting streams of information according to their reliabilities. However, how neural circuits keep track of both the stimulus and prediction uncertainty is not well understood. Here, we propose a network model whose core is a hierarchical prediction-error circuit. We show that our network can estimate the variance of the sensory stimuli and the uncertainty of the prediction using the activity of negative and positive prediction-error neurons. In line with previous hypotheses, we demonstrate that neural circuits rely strongly on feedback predictions if the perceived stimuli are noisy and the underlying generative process, that is, the environment is stable. Moreover, we show that predictions modulate neural activity at the onset of a new stimulus, even if this sensory information is reliable. In our network, the uncertainty estimation, and, hence, how much we rely on predictions, can be influenced by perturbing the intricate interplay of different inhibitory interneurons. We, therefore, investigate the contribution of those inhibitory interneurons to the weighting of feedforward and feedback inputs. Finally, we show that our network can be linked to biased perception and unravel how stimulus and prediction uncertainty contribute to the contraction bias.</p>
