M.; Bianciardi, M.; Misic, B.\nScore: 67.0, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564245\nThe brainstem is a fundamental component of the central nervous system yet it is typically excluded from in vivo human brain mapping efforts, precluding a complete understanding of how the brainstem influences cortical function. Here we use high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI to derive a functional connectome encompassing cortex as well as 58 brainstem nuclei spanning the midbrain, pons and medulla. We identify a compact set of integrative hubs in the brainstem with widespread connectivity with cerebral cortex. Patterns of connectivity between brainstem and cerebral cortex manifest as multiple emergent phenomena including neurophysiological oscillatory rhythms, patterns of cognitive functional specialization, and the unimodal-transmodal functional hierarchy. This persistent alignment between cortical functional topographies and brainstem nuclei is shaped by the spatial arrangement of multiple neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. We replicate all findings using 3 Tesla data from the same participants. Collectively, we find that multiple organizational features of cortical activity can be traced back to the brainstem.\nNeuroinflammation in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) as assessed by PBR28 PET correlates with vascular disease measures\nAuthors: VanElzakker, M. B.; Bues, H. F.; Brusaferri, L.; Kim, M.; Saadi, D.; Ratai, E.-M.; Dougherty, D. D.; Loggia, M. L.\nScore: 1057.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563117\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.\nMulti-region calcium imaging in freely behaving mice with ultra-compact head-mounted fluorescence microscopes\nAuthors: Xue, F.; Li, F.; Zhang, K.-m.; Ding, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, X.; Xu, F.; Zhang, D.; Sun, M.; Lau, P.-M.; Zhu, Q.; Zhou, P.; Bi, G.-Q.\nScore: 40.7, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564709\nTo investigate the circuit-level neural mechanisms of behavior, simultaneous imaging of neuronal activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions is highly desired. Miniature head-mounted microscopes offer the capability of calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, implanting multiple microscopes on a mouse brain remains challenging due to space constraints and the cumbersome weight of equipment. Here, we present TINIscope, a Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Proof-of-concept experiments with TINIscope recorded over 1000 neurons in four hippocampal subregions and revealed concurrent activity patterns spanning across these regions. Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.\n\"The Brain is...\": A Survey of The Brain's Many Definitions\nAuthors: Bolt, T. S.; Uddin, L.\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564205\nA reader of the peer-reviewed neuroscience literature will often encounter expressions like the following: the brain is a dynamic system, the brain is a complex network, or the brain is a highly metabolic organ. These expressions attempt to define the essential functions and properties of the mammalian or human brain in a simple phrase or sentence, sometimes using metaphors. We sought to survey the most common phrases of the form the brain is... in the biomedical literature to provide insights into current conceptualizations of the brain . Utilizing text analytic tools applied to a large sample of peer-reviewed full-text articles and abstracts, we extracted several thousand phrases of the form the brain is... and identified over a dozen frequently appearing phrases. The most used phrases included metaphors (e.g., the brain as a information processor or prediction machine) and descriptions of essential functions (e.g., a central organ of stress adaptation) or properties (e.g., a highly vascularized organ). The results of our analysis underscore the diversity of qualities and functions commonly attributed to the brain in the biomedical literature and suggest a range of conceptualizations that defy unification.\nGut microbiota promotes pain in fibromyalgia\nAuthors: Cai, W.; Haddad, M.; Haddad, R.; Kesten, I.; Hoffman, T.; Laan, R.; Wong, W.; Brown, N.; Tansley, S.; Lister, K.

L.; De Koninck, Y.; Brereton, N. J. B.; Gonzalez, E.; Shir, Y.; Minerbi, A.; Khoutorsky, A.\nScore: 32.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563794\nFibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain in the absence of evident tissue injury or pathology, making it one of the most mysterious chronic pain conditions. Despite affecting 2-4% of the population, primarily women1, the cause and underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia remain elusive, and effective targeted treatments are currently unavailable. The gut microbiota of women with fibromyalgia differs from healthy controls2,3. However, it is unknown whether changes in gut microbiota have a causal role in mediating pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Here, we show that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from individuals with fibromyalgia, but not from healthy controls, into germ-free mice induces persistent pain hypersensitivity. FMT from fibromyalgia patients led to a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density and alterations in the peripheral immune profile, and induced activation of spinal microglia, which contributed to the development of pain in mice. Notably, the pain hypersensitivity in mice that were administered microbiota from fibromyalgia patients resolved after FMT from healthy controls. Consistent with these findings, an open-label pilot study showed that transplanting microbiota from healthy individuals to humans with fibromyalgia alleviated pain and reduced overall symptom severity. Thus, altered gut microbiota has a causal role in fibromyalgia pain, highlighting it as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.\nDAP12 deficiency alters microglia-oligodendrocyte communication and enhances resilience against tau toxicity\nAuthors: Luo, W.; Che, H.; Fan, L.; Guo, Q.; Wong, M. Y.; Yu, F.; Foxe, N.; Wang, W.; Nessim, A.; Carling, G.; Liu, B.; Lopez-Lee, C.; Huang, Y.; Amin, S.; Patel, T.; Mok, S.-A.; Song, W.-m.; Zhang, B.; Ma, Q.; Fu, H.; Gan, L.\nScore: 29.2, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.563970\nPathogenic tau accumulation fuels neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD). Enhancing aging brains resilience to tau pathology would lead to novel therapeutic strategies. DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein 12) is critically involved in microglial immune responses. Previous studies have showed that mice lacking DAP12 in tauopathy mice exhibit higher tau pathology but are protected from tau-induced cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Our current study uncovers a novel resilience mechanism via microglial interaction with oligodendrocytes. Despite higher tau inclusions, Dap12 deletion curbs tau-induced brain inflammation and ameliorates myelin and synapse loss. Specifically, removal of Dap12 abolished tau-induced disease-associated clusters in microglia (MG) and intermediate oligodendrocytes (iOli), which are spatially correlated with tau pathology in AD brains. Our study highlights the critical role of interactions between microglia and oligodendrocytes in tau toxicity and DAP12 signaling as a promising target for enhancing resilience in AD.\nRobust reprogramming of glia into neurons by inhibition of Notch signaling and NFI factors in adult mammalian retina.\nAuthors: Le, N.; Vu, T.-D.; Pulya, R.; Kim, Y.; Blackshaw, S.; Hoang, T.\nScore: 27.8, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.560483\nNeurogenic competence is actively repressed in mature mammalian Muller glial cells, and previous studies have predicted that this is in part mediated by active Notch signaling. To determine whether global loss of Notch signaling could induce reprogramming of, we selectively deleted the common Notch transcriptional mediator Rbpj in adult mouse Muller glia while simultaneously tracing the fate of Muller glia-derived cells. We observed that Rbpj-deficient Muller glia directly transdifferentiate into bipolar and amacrine cells in the absence of injury, but also observed that this effect was significantly enhanced by NMDA-dependent excitotoxic injury. We found that Muller glia-specific loss of function of Notch1 and Notch2 phenocopied this injury-induced induction of neurogenic competence. Integrated multiomic and Cut\u0026Tag analysis revealed that Rbpj directly activates Notch effectors and mature Muller glial-specific genes, and indirectly represses expression of neurogenic bHLH factors. Moreover, we find that combined loss of function of Rbpj and Nfia/b/x leads to a near-complete conversion of Muller glia to neurons in the absence of proliferation, leading to a severe disruption of retinal structure as the result of Muller glia depletion. Finally, however, we show that induction of Muller glial proliferation by AAV-mediated overexpression of dominant-active Yap both preserves retinal structure and supports efficient levels of Muller glia-derived neurogenesis in both Rbpj- and Nfia/b/x/Rbpj-deficient Muller glia. These findings demonstrate that, like in zebrafish, Notch signaling actively represses neurogenic competence in mammalian Muller glia, and imply that inhibition of Notch signaling in combination with Nfia/b/x loss of function and overexpression of activated Yap, could be an effective component of regenerative therapies for degenerative retinal diseases.\nRelating sex differences in cortical and hippocampal microstructure to sex hormones\nAuthors: Kuechenhoff, S.; Bayrak, S.; Zsido, R. G.; Saberi, A.; Bernhardt, B.; Weis, S.; Schaare, H. L.; Sacher, J.; Eickhoff, S.; Valk, S.\nScore: 23.7, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565213\nSex hormone receptors are expressed widely in both neurons and glial cells, which allows them to interact with the brains major cell groups via several molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms lead to sex differences in brain structure as well as hormone-induced plasticity in the female brain across the menstrual cycle. Adding to the literature on volumetric changes in cortical structure, here we set out to investigate sex differences in the microstructure of the human cortex in relation to sex hormones. We assessed regional variation in cortical microstructure as a function of sex, hormonal status and sex hormone receptor gene expression distribution based on quantitative intracortical profiling in vivo using the magnetic resonance imaging based T1w/T2w ratio in 992 healthy females and males of the Human Connectome Project young adult sample. We demonstrate that microstructure in isocortex and hippocampus differs regionally between males and females, that this effect varies with hormone levels of females and that implicated brain regions overlap with estrogen receptor and sex steroid synthesis gene expression. Lastly, we show that sex and sex hormone related brain structure variations are most pronounced in areas of low laminar cortical complexity (agranular cortex), which are also predicted to be most plastic based on their cytoarchitectural properties. Together, our data thus are suggestive of sex differences in cortical and hippocampal microstructure, as well as the modulatory function of sex hormones on these measures. Albeit correlative, this study underscores the importance of incorporating sex hormone variables into the investigation of brain structure and plasticity.\nMenstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and grey matter architecture changes across the whole brain\nAuthors: Rizor, E. J.; Babenko, V.; Dundon, N. M.; Beverly-Aylwin, R.; Stump, A.; Hayes, M.; Herschenfeld-Catalan, L.; Jacobs, E. G.; Grafton, S. T.\nScore: 304.3, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561616\nCyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.\nDynamic layer-specific processing in the prefrontal cortex during working memory\nAuthors: Degutis, J. K.; Chaimow, D.; Haenelt, D.; Assem, M.; Duncan, J.; Haynes, J.-D.; Weiskopf, N.; Lorenz, R.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564330\nThe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reliably engaged in working memory (WM). Evidence from non-human primates indicates that the dlPFC comprises different cytoarchitectonic layers that play distinct roles in WM subprocesses; yet the functional role of the dlPFCs laminar circuitry in human WM is not well understood. In this study, participants completed a delayed-match-to-sample WM task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high resolution, which allowed us to examine layer-specific responses of the dlPFC to manipulations in WM load and motor response. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses across all periods of the WM task: encoding, delay and retrieval. First, we observed that superficial layers activate stronger than deep layers to higher WM load during the delay period. This aligns with earlier work showing preferential superficial layer activation to WM manipulation and as such may indicate lamina-specific activation of the frontoparietal network to heightened task demands more generally. Second, we found that superficial layers show higher decoding of WM load differences than deep layers during the retrieval period. In this context, we could show that decoding of WM load in the superficial layer exhibited dynamic changes across the encoding, delay and retrieval period of the task, indicative of separate WM control processes that occur on the WM content. Last, we found that superficial and deep layers are both non-differentially involved in the motor response, contradicting earlier findings of a preferential deep layer activation in humans. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the functional laminar circuitry of the dlPFC during WM and provide further support for a dynamic account of dlPFC coding.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The brainstem is a fundamental component of the central nervous system yet it is typically excluded from in vivo human brain mapping efforts, precluding a complete understanding of how the brainstem influences cortical function. Here we use high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI to derive a functional connectome encompassing cortex as well as 58 brainstem nuclei spanning the midbrain, pons and medulla. We identify a compact set of integrative hubs in the brainstem with widespread connectivity with cerebral cortex. Patterns of connectivity between brainstem and cerebral cortex manifest as multiple emergent phenomena including neurophysiological oscillatory rhythms, patterns of cognitive functional specialization, and the unimodal-transmodal functional hierarchy. This persistent alignment between cortical functional topographies and brainstem nuclei is shaped by the spatial arrangement of multiple neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. We replicate all findings using 3 Tesla data from the same participants. Collectively, we find that multiple organizational features of cortical activity can be traced back to the brainstem.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To investigate the circuit-level neural mechanisms of behavior, simultaneous imaging of neuronal activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions is highly desired. Miniature head-mounted microscopes offer the capability of calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, implanting multiple microscopes on a mouse brain remains challenging due to space constraints and the cumbersome weight of equipment. Here, we present TINIscope, a Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Proof-of-concept experiments with TINIscope recorded over 1000 neurons in four hippocampal subregions and revealed concurrent activity patterns spanning across these regions. Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A reader of the peer-reviewed neuroscience literature will often encounter expressions like the following:  the brain is a dynamic system,  the brain is a complex network, or  the brain is a highly metabolic organ. These expressions attempt to define the essential functions and properties of the mammalian or human brain in a simple phrase or sentence, sometimes using metaphors. We sought to survey the most common phrases of the form  the brain is... in the biomedical literature to provide insights into current conceptualizations of the brain . Utilizing text analytic tools applied to a large sample of peer-reviewed full-text articles and abstracts, we extracted several thousand phrases of the form  the brain is... and identified over a dozen frequently appearing phrases. The most used phrases included metaphors (e.g., the brain as a  information processor or  prediction machine) and descriptions of essential functions (e.g.,  a central organ of stress adaptation) or properties (e.g.,  a highly vascularized organ). The results of our analysis underscore the diversity of qualities and functions commonly attributed to the brain in the biomedical literature and suggest a range of conceptualizations that defy unification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain in the absence of evident tissue injury or pathology, making it one of the most mysterious chronic pain conditions. Despite affecting 2-4% of the population, primarily women1, the cause and underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia remain elusive, and effective targeted treatments are currently unavailable. The gut microbiota of women with fibromyalgia differs from healthy controls2,3. However, it is unknown whether changes in gut microbiota have a causal role in mediating pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Here, we show that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from individuals with fibromyalgia, but not from healthy controls, into germ-free mice induces persistent pain hypersensitivity. FMT from fibromyalgia patients led to a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density and alterations in the peripheral immune profile, and induced activation of spinal microglia, which contributed to the development of pain in mice. Notably, the pain hypersensitivity in mice that were administered microbiota from fibromyalgia patients resolved after FMT from healthy controls. Consistent with these findings, an open-label pilot study showed that transplanting microbiota from healthy individuals to humans with fibromyalgia alleviated pain and reduced overall symptom severity. Thus, altered gut microbiota has a causal role in fibromyalgia pain, highlighting it as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogenic tau accumulation fuels neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD). Enhancing aging brains resilience to tau pathology would lead to novel therapeutic strategies. DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein 12) is critically involved in microglial immune responses. Previous studies have showed that mice lacking DAP12 in tauopathy mice exhibit higher tau pathology but are protected from tau-induced cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Our current study uncovers a novel resilience mechanism via microglial interaction with oligodendrocytes. Despite higher tau inclusions, Dap12 deletion curbs tau-induced brain inflammation and ameliorates myelin and synapse loss. Specifically, removal of Dap12 abolished tau-induced disease-associated clusters in microglia (MG) and intermediate oligodendrocytes (iOli), which are spatially correlated with tau pathology in AD brains. Our study highlights the critical role of interactions between microglia and oligodendrocytes in tau toxicity and DAP12 signaling as a promising target for enhancing resilience in AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurogenic competence is actively repressed in mature mammalian Muller glial cells, and previous studies have predicted that this is in part mediated by active Notch signaling. To determine whether global loss of Notch signaling could induce reprogramming of, we selectively deleted the common Notch transcriptional mediator Rbpj in adult mouse Muller glia while simultaneously tracing the fate of Muller glia-derived cells. We observed that Rbpj-deficient Muller glia directly transdifferentiate into bipolar and amacrine cells in the absence of injury, but also observed that this effect was significantly enhanced by NMDA-dependent excitotoxic injury. We found that Muller glia-specific loss of function of Notch1 and Notch2 phenocopied this injury-induced induction of neurogenic competence. Integrated multiomic and Cut&amp;Tag analysis revealed that Rbpj directly activates Notch effectors and mature Muller glial-specific genes, and indirectly represses expression of neurogenic bHLH factors. Moreover, we find that combined loss of function of Rbpj and Nfia/b/x leads to a near-complete conversion of Muller glia to neurons in the absence of proliferation, leading to a severe disruption of retinal structure as the result of Muller glia depletion. Finally, however, we show that induction of Muller glial proliferation by AAV-mediated overexpression of dominant-active Yap both preserves retinal structure and supports efficient levels of Muller glia-derived neurogenesis in both Rbpj- and Nfia/b/x/Rbpj-deficient Muller glia. These findings demonstrate that, like in zebrafish, Notch signaling actively represses neurogenic competence in mammalian Muller glia, and imply that inhibition of Notch signaling in combination with Nfia/b/x loss of function and overexpression of activated Yap, could be an effective component of regenerative therapies for degenerative retinal diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex hormone receptors are expressed widely in both neurons and glial cells, which allows them to interact with the brains major cell groups via several molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms lead to sex differences in brain structure as well as hormone-induced plasticity in the female brain across the menstrual cycle. Adding to the literature on volumetric changes in cortical structure, here we set out to investigate sex differences in the microstructure of the human cortex in relation to sex hormones. We assessed regional variation in cortical microstructure as a function of sex, hormonal status and sex hormone receptor gene expression distribution based on quantitative intracortical profiling in vivo using the magnetic resonance imaging based T1w/T2w ratio in 992 healthy females and males of the Human Connectome Project young adult sample. We demonstrate that microstructure in isocortex and hippocampus differs regionally between males and females, that this effect varies with hormone levels of females and that implicated brain regions overlap with estrogen receptor and sex steroid synthesis gene expression. Lastly, we show that sex and sex hormone related brain structure variations are most pronounced in areas of low laminar cortical complexity (agranular cortex), which are also predicted to be most plastic based on their cytoarchitectural properties. Together, our data thus are suggestive of sex differences in cortical and hippocampal microstructure, as well as the modulatory function of sex hormones on these measures. Albeit correlative, this study underscores the importance of incorporating sex hormone variables into the investigation of brain structure and plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reliably engaged in working memory (WM). Evidence from non-human primates indicates that the dlPFC comprises different cytoarchitectonic layers that play distinct roles in WM subprocesses; yet the functional role of the dlPFCs laminar circuitry in human WM is not well understood. In this study, participants completed a delayed-match-to-sample WM task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high resolution, which allowed us to examine layer-specific responses of the dlPFC to manipulations in WM load and motor response. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses across all periods of the WM task: encoding, delay and retrieval. First, we observed that superficial layers activate stronger than deep layers to higher WM load during the delay period. This aligns with earlier work showing preferential superficial layer activation to WM manipulation and as such may indicate lamina-specific activation of the frontoparietal network to heightened task demands more generally. Second, we found that superficial layers show higher decoding of WM load differences than deep layers during the retrieval period. In this context, we could show that decoding of WM load in the superficial layer exhibited dynamic changes across the encoding, delay and retrieval period of the task, indicative of separate WM control processes that occur on the WM content. Last, we found that superficial and deep layers are both non-differentially involved in the motor response, contradicting earlier findings of a preferential deep layer activation in humans. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the functional laminar circuitry of the dlPFC during WM and provide further support for a dynamic account of dlPFC coding.</p>
