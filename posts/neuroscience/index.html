A.; Satterthwaite, T. D.\nScore: 45.7, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567926\nFunctional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded \u003e3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.\nWhole-brain modelling of low-dimensional manifold modes reveals organising principle of brain dynamics\nAuthors: Sanz Perl, Y.; Geli, S.; Perez-Ordoyo, E.; Zonca, L.; Idesis, S.; Vohryzek, J.; Jirsa, V. K.; Kringelbach, M. L.; Tagliazucchi, E.; Deco, G.\nScore: 32.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567824\nThe revolutionary discovery of resting state networks radically shifted the focus from the role of local regions in cognitive tasks to the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in global networks. Yet, there is a growing realisation that these resting state networks could be a bit like the shadow tracings in Platos famous cave, perhaps mere epiphenomena of an underlying hidden space from where these shadows emanate. Here we used deep variational auto-encoders to extract manifolds of low dimensionality from whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, we constructed the first dynamical model of the low dimensional manifold modes, i.e., networks of nodes using non-linear oscillators coupled with the effective functional connectivity, taking into account the level of non-equilibrium dynamics quantified by the non-reversibility of the signals. Irrespective of parcellation size, we found an optimal number of roughly ten manifold modes to best describe the whole-brain activity. Importantly, compared to traditional whole-brain modelling using all the nodes in a parcellation, we obtained better results for resting and task activity by modelling the dynamics of the coupled manifold modes. These findings show the key causal role of manifolds as a fundamental organising principle of brain function at the whole-brain scale, providing evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of the brain.\nUnravelling the neural dynamics of hypnotic susceptibility: Aperiodic neural activity as a central feature of hypnosis\nAuthors: Landry, M.; da Silva Castanheira, J.; Sackur, J.; Raz, A.; Ogez, D.; Rainville, P.; Jerbi, K.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567097\nThe ability for hypnotic responding is marked by great inter-individual variation in the population, while the neural underpinning of this variability remains elusive. The current work leveraged multivariate statistics and machine learning to probe the neural dynamics underlying inter-individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility. We assessed the efficacy of linear classifiers in distinguishing between high and low hypnotic susceptible individuals using neural features from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) both pre- and post-hypnotic induction. Our focus encompassed both aperiodic and periodic components of the power spectrum, and graph theoretical measures derived from functional connectivity patterns. Several neural features from both pre- and post-induction significantly differentiated susceptibility levels, which underscores the complex dynamics of hypnotic phenomena. Based on model comparisons and feature ranking, we discerned the pre-induction aperiodic exponent as the primary discriminating neural feature, while periodic activity did not differ between groups. This novel finding not only resonates with the increasing emphasis on this neural component in broader EEG research but also promotes the idea that the primary neural distinction in hypnotic susceptibility is evident at baseline, even before hypnosis. Based on prevailing interpretation of aperiodicity in the EEG signal, our findings support the idea that hypnotic susceptibility might be an inherent trait reflected in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Significance StatementHypnotic phenomena reflect the ability to alter ones subjective experiences based on targeted verbal suggestions. While research has made strides in understanding the cognitive aspects underlying the variability in ones susceptibility to hypnosis, the brain correlates remain largely elusive. Addressing this gap, our study employs multivariate pattern classification and machine learning to predict hypnotic susceptibility. By recording electroencephalography (EEG) before and after hypnotic induction and analyzing diverse neurophysiological features, we identify several features that differentiate between high and low hypnotic susceptible individuals for both pre- and post-induction periods, which underscores the multifaceted nature of hypnotic phenomena. Our analysis revealed that the paramount discriminative feature is arrhythmic (i.e., non-oscillatory) EEG activity prior to the induction--a novel discovery in the field. This finding, that the chief EEG marker is observed even before hypnosis, aligns with the idea that hypnotic susceptibility represents an inherent trait reflecting the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural activity.\nEngineered odorant receptors illuminate structural principles of odor discrimination\nAuthors: de March, C. A.; Ma, N.; Billesboelle, C. B.; Tewari, J.; del Torrent, C. L.; van der Velden, W. J.; Ojiro, I.; Takayama, I.; Faust, B.; Li, L.; Vaidehi, N.; Manglik, A.; Matsunami, H.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567230\nA central challenge in olfaction is understanding how the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations. Vertebrate animals perceive odors via G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs). In humans, [~]400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family is composed of two major classes: Class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids while Class II ORs, representing the vast majority of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants. How ORs recognize chemically diverse odorants remains poorly understood. A fundamental bottleneck is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here, we uncover fundamental molecular properties of odorant-OR interactions by employing engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modeling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled four cryoEM structures of distinct consORs with unique ligand recognition properties. The structure of a Class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and yielded a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three Class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between Class I and Class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.\nStereotyped goal-directed activity patterns in the insular cortex\nAuthors: Talpir, I.; Livneh, Y.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566809\nThe insular cortex is involved in diverse processes including bodily homeostasis, emotions, and cognition. Yet little is known about how it processes information at the level of neuronal populations, precluding an understanding of the computations it performs. We leveraged recent advances in machine learning to study insular cortex population activity patterns (i.e., neuronal manifold) in mice performing goal-directed behaviors. We find that the insular cortex activity manifold is remarkably consistent across different animals and under different motivational states. Activity dynamics within the neuronal manifold are highly stereotyped during rewarded trials, enabling robust prediction of trial outcomes across different mice, and across various natural and artificial motivational states. Comparing goal-directed behavior with self-paced free consumption, we find that the stereotyped activity patterns reflect goal-directed reward anticipation, and not licking, taste, or valence. These findings reveal a core computation in insular cortex that could explain its involvement in pathologies involving aberrant motivations. O_LIInsCtx activity manifold structure is stereotyped across different mice and motivations. C_LIO_LIInsCtx activity dynamics within the manifold are stereotyped across different mice and motivations. C_LIO_LIStereotyped activity dynamics reflect goal-directed reward anticipation. C_LIO_LIStereotyped activity dynamics do not reflect licking, taste, or valence.

J.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568163\nSurvival behaviors are orchestrated by hardwired circuits located in deep subcortical brain regions, most prominently the hypothalamus. Artificial activation of spatially localized, genetically defined hypothalamic cell populations is known to trigger distinct behaviors, suggesting a nucleus-centered organization of behavioral control. However, no study has investigated the hypothalamic representation of innate behaviors using unbiased, large-scale single neuron recordings. Here, using custom silicon probes, we performed recordings across the rostro-caudal extent of the medial hypothalamus in freely moving animals engaged in a diverse array of social and predator defense (\"fear\") behaviors. Nucleus-averaged activity revealed spatially distributed generic \"ignition signals\" that occurred at the onset of each behavior, and did not identify sparse, nucleus-specific behavioral representations. Single-unit analysis revealed that social and fear behavior classes are encoded by activity in distinct sets of spatially distributed neuronal ensembles spanning the entire hypothalamic rostro-caudal axis. Individual ensemble membership, however, was drawn from neurons in 3-4 adjacent nuclei. Mixed selectivity was identified as the most prevalent mode of behavior representation by individual hypothalamic neurons. Encoding models indicated that a significant fraction of the variance in single neuron activity is explained by behavior. This work reveals that innate behaviors are encoded in the hypothalamus by activity in spatially distributed neural ensembles that each span multiple neighboring nuclei, complementing the prevailing view of hypothalamic behavioral control by single nucleus-restricted cell types derived from perturbational studies.\nPain persists in mice lacking both Substance P and CGRPα signaling\nAuthors: MacDonald, D. I.; Jayabalan, M.; Seaman, J. T.; Nickolls, A. R.; Chesler, A. T.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567208\nThe neuropeptides Substance P and CGRP have long been thought important for pain sensation. Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRP are extensively co-expressed we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated Tac1 and Calca double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRP peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRP are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.\nGenetic labeling of embryonically-born dentate granule neurons in young mice using the PenkCre mouse line\nAuthors: Mortessagne, P.; Cartier, E.; Balia, M.; Fevre, M.; Corailler, F.; Herry, C.; Abrous, N.; Battefeld, A.; Pacary, E.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567945\nThe dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a mosaic of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) accumulated throughout life. While many studies focused on the morpho-functional properties of adult-born DGNs, much less is known about DGNs generated during development, and in particular those born during embryogenesis. One of the main reasons for this gap is the lack of methods available to specifically label and manipulate embryonically-born DGNs. Here, we have assessed the relevance of the PenkCre mouse line as a genetic model to target this embryonically-born population. In young animals, PenkCre expression allows to tag neurons in the DG with positional, morphological and electrophysiological properties characteristic of DGNs born during the embryonic period. In addition, PenkCre+ cells in the DG are distributed in both blades along the entire septo-temporal axis. This model thus offers new possibilities to explore the functions of this underexplored population of embryonically-born DGNs.\nMicroglia undergo transcriptional, translational and functional adaptations to dark and light phases in laboratory mice\nAuthors: Mattei, D.; Ivanov, A.; Hammer, J.; Ugursu, B.; Schalbetter, S.; Richetto, J.; Weber-Stadelbauer, U.; Mueller, F.; Scarborough, J.; Wolf, S. A.; Kettenmann, H.; Wollscheid, B.; Beule, D.; Meyer, U.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567571\nMicroglia cells are increasingly recognized to contribute to brain health and disease. Preclinical studies using laboratory rodents are essential to advance our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of these cells in the central nervous system. Rodents are nocturnal animals, and they are mostly maintained in a defined light-dark cycle within animal facilities, with many laboratories investigating microglial molecular and functional profiles during the animals light (sleep) phase. However, only a few studies have considered possible differences in microglial functions between the active and sleep phases. Based on initial evidence suggesting that microglial intrinsic clock genes can affect their phenotype, we sought to investigate differences in transcriptional, proteotype and functional profiles of microglia between light (sleep) and dark (active) phases, and how these changes are affected in pathological models. We found marked transcriptional and proteotype differences between microglia harvested during the light or dark phase. Amongst others, these differences related to genes and proteins associated with immune responses, motility, and phagocytosis, which were reflected by functional alterations in microglial synaptic pruning and response to bacterial stimuli. Possibly accounting for such circadian changes, we found RNA and protein regulation in SWI/SNF and NuRD chromatin remodeling complexes between light and dark phases. Importantly, we show that microglial circadian transcriptional changes are impaired in a model of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering circadian factors in studying microglial cells and indicate that implementing a circadian perspective is pivotal for advancing our understanding of their physiological and pathophysiological roles in brain health and disease. This may also open novel avenues towards therapeutic strategies for modulating microglial functions during specific windows of the active or sleep phase.\nA shared spatial topography links the functional connectome correlates of cocaine use disorder and dopamine D2/3 receptor densities\nAuthors: Ricard, J. A.; Labache, L.; Segal, A.; Dhamala, E.; Cocuzza, C. V.; Jones, G.; Yip, S.; Chopra, S.; Holmes, A. J.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567591\nBackgroundThe biological mechanisms that contribute to cocaine and other substance use disorders involve an array of cortical and subcortical systems. Prior work on the development and maintenance of substance use has largely focused on cortico-striatal circuits, with relatively less attention on alterations within and across large-scale functional brain networks, and associated aspects of the dopamine system. The brain-wide pattern of temporal co-activation between distinct brain regions, referred to as the functional connectome, underpins individual differences in behavior. Critically, the functional connectome correlates of substance use and their specificity to dopamine receptor densities relative to other metabotropic receptors classes remains to be established. MethodsWe comprehensively characterized brain-wide differences in functional connectivity across multiple scales, including individual connections, regions, and networks in participants with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n=69) and healthy matched controls (n=62), Further, we studied the relationship between the observed functional connectivity signatures of CUD and the spatial distribution of a broad range of normative neurotransmitter receptor and transporter bindings as assessed through 18 different normative positron emission tomography (PET) maps. ResultsOur analyses identified a widespread profile of functional connectivity differences between individuals with CUD and matched healthy comparison participants (8.8% of total edges; 8,185 edges; pFWE=0.025). We largely find lower connectivity preferentially linking default network and subcortical regions, and higher within-network connectivity in the default network in participants with CUD. Furthermore, we find consistent and replicable associations between signatures of CUD and normative spatial density of dopamine D2/3 receptors. ConclusionsOur analyses revealed a widespread profile of altered connectivity in individuals with CUD that extends across the functional connectome and implicates multiple circuits. This profile is robustly coupled with normative dopamine D2/3 receptors densities. Underscoring the translational potential of connectomic approaches for the study of in vivo brain functions, CUD- linked aspects of brain function were spatially coupled to disorder relevant neurotransmitter systems. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre there group differences in whole brain functional connectivity between individuals with and without cocaine use disorder, and to what extent do these connectivity patterns relate to the spatial distribution of dopamine (D2/3) receptor densities? FindingsThe presence of cocaine use disorder is associated with brain-wide functional connectivity alterations that are spatially coupled to the density of dopamine (D2/3) receptors. MeaningA preferential and replicable link exists between the functional connectome correlates of cocaine use disorder and dopamine receptor densities across the brain.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Functional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded &gt;3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The revolutionary discovery of resting state networks radically shifted the focus from the role of local regions in cognitive tasks to the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in global networks. Yet, there is a growing realisation that these resting state networks could be a bit like the shadow tracings in Platos famous cave, perhaps mere epiphenomena of an underlying hidden space from where these shadows emanate. Here we used deep variational auto-encoders to extract manifolds of low dimensionality from whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, we constructed the first dynamical model of the low dimensional manifold modes, i.e., networks of nodes using non-linear oscillators coupled with the effective functional connectivity, taking into account the level of non-equilibrium dynamics quantified by the non-reversibility of the signals. Irrespective of parcellation size, we found an optimal number of roughly ten manifold modes to best describe the whole-brain activity. Importantly, compared to traditional whole-brain modelling using all the nodes in a parcellation, we obtained better results for resting and task activity by modelling the dynamics of the coupled manifold modes. These findings show the key causal role of manifolds as a fundamental organising principle of brain function at the whole-brain scale, providing evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of the brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability for hypnotic responding is marked by great inter-individual variation in the population, while the neural underpinning of this variability remains elusive. The current work leveraged multivariate statistics and machine learning to probe the neural dynamics underlying inter-individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility. We assessed the efficacy of linear classifiers in distinguishing between high and low hypnotic susceptible individuals using neural features from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) both pre- and post-hypnotic induction. Our focus encompassed both aperiodic and periodic components of the power spectrum, and graph theoretical measures derived from functional connectivity patterns. Several neural features from both pre- and post-induction significantly differentiated susceptibility levels, which underscores the complex dynamics of hypnotic phenomena. Based on model comparisons and feature ranking, we discerned the pre-induction aperiodic exponent as the primary discriminating neural feature, while periodic activity did not differ between groups. This novel finding not only resonates with the increasing emphasis on this neural component in broader EEG research but also promotes the idea that the primary neural distinction in hypnotic susceptibility is evident at baseline, even before hypnosis. Based on prevailing interpretation of aperiodicity in the EEG signal, our findings support the idea that hypnotic susceptibility might be an inherent trait reflected in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition.

Significance StatementHypnotic phenomena reflect the ability to alter ones subjective experiences based on targeted verbal suggestions. While research has made strides in understanding the cognitive aspects underlying the variability in ones susceptibility to hypnosis, the brain correlates remain largely elusive. Addressing this gap, our study employs multivariate pattern classification and machine learning to predict hypnotic susceptibility. By recording electroencephalography (EEG) before and after hypnotic induction and analyzing diverse neurophysiological features, we identify several features that differentiate between high and low hypnotic susceptible individuals for both pre- and post-induction periods, which underscores the multifaceted nature of hypnotic phenomena. Our analysis revealed that the paramount discriminative feature is arrhythmic (i.e., non-oscillatory) EEG activity prior to the induction--a novel discovery in the field. This finding, that the chief EEG marker is observed even before hypnosis, aligns with the idea that hypnotic susceptibility represents an inherent trait reflecting the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A central challenge in olfaction is understanding how the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations. Vertebrate animals perceive odors via G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs). In humans, [~]400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family is composed of two major classes: Class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids while Class II ORs, representing the vast majority of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants. How ORs recognize chemically diverse odorants remains poorly understood. A fundamental bottleneck is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here, we uncover fundamental molecular properties of odorant-OR interactions by employing engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modeling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled four cryoEM structures of distinct consORs with unique ligand recognition properties. The structure of a Class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and yielded a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three Class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between Class I and Class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The insular cortex is involved in diverse processes including bodily homeostasis, emotions, and cognition. Yet little is known about how it processes information at the level of neuronal populations, precluding an understanding of the computations it performs. We leveraged recent advances in machine learning to study insular cortex population activity patterns (i.e., neuronal manifold) in mice performing goal-directed behaviors. We find that the insular cortex activity manifold is remarkably consistent across different animals and under different motivational states. Activity dynamics within the neuronal manifold are highly stereotyped during rewarded trials, enabling robust prediction of trial outcomes across different mice, and across various natural and artificial motivational states. Comparing goal-directed behavior with self-paced free consumption, we find that the stereotyped activity patterns reflect goal-directed reward anticipation, and not licking, taste, or valence. These findings reveal a core computation in insular cortex that could explain its involvement in pathologies involving aberrant motivations.

        <p class="abstract">Survival behaviors are orchestrated by hardwired circuits located in deep subcortical brain regions, most prominently the hypothalamus. Artificial activation of spatially localized, genetically defined hypothalamic cell populations is known to trigger distinct behaviors, suggesting a nucleus-centered organization of behavioral control. However, no study has investigated the hypothalamic representation of innate behaviors using unbiased, large-scale single neuron recordings. Here, using custom silicon probes, we performed recordings across the rostro-caudal extent of the medial hypothalamus in freely moving animals engaged in a diverse array of social and predator defense (&#34;fear&#34;) behaviors. Nucleus-averaged activity revealed spatially distributed generic &#34;ignition signals&#34; that occurred at the onset of each behavior, and did not identify sparse, nucleus-specific behavioral representations. Single-unit analysis revealed that social and fear behavior classes are encoded by activity in distinct sets of spatially distributed neuronal ensembles spanning the entire hypothalamic rostro-caudal axis. Individual ensemble membership, however, was drawn from neurons in 3-4 adjacent nuclei. Mixed selectivity was identified as the most prevalent mode of behavior representation by individual hypothalamic neurons. Encoding models indicated that a significant fraction of the variance in single neuron activity is explained by behavior. This work reveals that innate behaviors are encoded in the hypothalamus by activity in spatially distributed neural ensembles that each span multiple neighboring nuclei, complementing the prevailing view of hypothalamic behavioral control by single nucleus-restricted cell types derived from perturbational studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuropeptides Substance P and CGRP have long been thought important for pain sensation. Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRP are extensively co-expressed we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated Tac1 and Calca double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRP peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRP are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a mosaic of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) accumulated throughout life. While many studies focused on the morpho-functional properties of adult-born DGNs, much less is known about DGNs generated during development, and in particular those born during embryogenesis. One of the main reasons for this gap is the lack of methods available to specifically label and manipulate embryonically-born DGNs. Here, we have assessed the relevance of the PenkCre mouse line as a genetic model to target this embryonically-born population. In young animals, PenkCre expression allows to tag neurons in the DG with positional, morphological and electrophysiological properties characteristic of DGNs born during the embryonic period. In addition, PenkCre&#43; cells in the DG are distributed in both blades along the entire septo-temporal axis. This model thus offers new possibilities to explore the functions of this underexplored population of embryonically-born DGNs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microglia cells are increasingly recognized to contribute to brain health and disease. Preclinical studies using laboratory rodents are essential to advance our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of these cells in the central nervous system. Rodents are nocturnal animals, and they are mostly maintained in a defined light-dark cycle within animal facilities, with many laboratories investigating microglial molecular and functional profiles during the animals light (sleep) phase. However, only a few studies have considered possible differences in microglial functions between the active and sleep phases. Based on initial evidence suggesting that microglial intrinsic clock genes can affect their phenotype, we sought to investigate differences in transcriptional, proteotype and functional profiles of microglia between light (sleep) and dark (active) phases, and how these changes are affected in pathological models. We found marked transcriptional and proteotype differences between microglia harvested during the light or dark phase. Amongst others, these differences related to genes and proteins associated with immune responses, motility, and phagocytosis, which were reflected by functional alterations in microglial synaptic pruning and response to bacterial stimuli. Possibly accounting for such circadian changes, we found RNA and protein regulation in SWI/SNF and NuRD chromatin remodeling complexes between light and dark phases. Importantly, we show that microglial circadian transcriptional changes are impaired in a model of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering circadian factors in studying microglial cells and indicate that implementing a circadian perspective is pivotal for advancing our understanding of their physiological and pathophysiological roles in brain health and disease. This may also open novel avenues towards therapeutic strategies for modulating microglial functions during specific windows of the active or sleep phase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe biological mechanisms that contribute to cocaine and other substance use disorders involve an array of cortical and subcortical systems. Prior work on the development and maintenance of substance use has largely focused on cortico-striatal circuits, with relatively less attention on alterations within and across large-scale functional brain networks, and associated aspects of the dopamine system. The brain-wide pattern of temporal co-activation between distinct brain regions, referred to as the functional connectome, underpins individual differences in behavior. Critically, the functional connectome correlates of substance use and their specificity to dopamine receptor densities relative to other metabotropic receptors classes remains to be established.

MethodsWe comprehensively characterized brain-wide differences in functional connectivity across multiple scales, including individual connections, regions, and networks in participants with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n=69) and healthy matched controls (n=62), Further, we studied the relationship between the observed functional connectivity signatures of CUD and the spatial distribution of a broad range of normative neurotransmitter receptor and transporter bindings as assessed through 18 different normative positron emission tomography (PET) maps.

ResultsOur analyses identified a widespread profile of functional connectivity differences between individuals with CUD and matched healthy comparison participants (8.8% of total edges; 8,185 edges; pFWE=0.025). We largely find lower connectivity preferentially linking default network and subcortical regions, and higher within-network connectivity in the default network in participants with CUD. Furthermore, we find consistent and replicable associations between signatures of CUD and normative spatial density of dopamine D2/3 receptors.

ConclusionsOur analyses revealed a widespread profile of altered connectivity in individuals with CUD that extends across the functional connectome and implicates multiple circuits. This profile is robustly coupled with normative dopamine D2/3 receptors densities. Underscoring the translational potential of connectomic approaches for the study of in vivo brain functions, CUD- linked aspects of brain function were spatially coupled to disorder relevant neurotransmitter systems.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre there group differences in whole brain functional connectivity between individuals with and without cocaine use disorder, and to what extent do these connectivity patterns relate to the spatial distribution of dopamine (D2/3) receptor densities?

FindingsThe presence of cocaine use disorder is associated with brain-wide functional connectivity alterations that are spatially coupled to the density of dopamine (D2/3) receptors.

MeaningA preferential and replicable link exists between the functional connectome correlates of cocaine use disorder and dopamine receptor densities across the brain.</p>
