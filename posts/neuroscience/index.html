R.; Zhi, D.; Shahshahani, L.; Luisa Pinho, A.; Saadon-Grosmann, N.; Buckner, R. L.; Diedrichsen, J.\nScore: 69.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557689\nThe human cerebellum is activated by a wide variety of cognitive and motor tasks. Previous functional atlases have relied on single task-based or resting-state fMRI datasets. Here, we present a functional atlas that integrates information from 7 large-scale datasets, outperforming existing group atlasses. The new atlas has three further advantages: First, the regions are hierarchically organized across 3 levels, allowing analyses at the appropriate level of granularity. Second, we provide both asymmetric and symmetric versions of the atlas. The symmetric version, which is obtained by constraining the boundaries to be the same across hemispheres, is especially useful in studying functional lateralization. Finally, the atlas allows for precision mapping in individuals: The integration of the probabilistic group atlas with an individual localizer scan results in a marked improvement in prediction of individual boundaries. Overall, the new atlas is an important resource for the study of the interdigitated functional organization of the human cerebellum in health and disease.\nNeuronal polyunsaturated fatty acids are protective in FTD/ALS\nAuthors: Giblin, A.; Cammack, A. J.; Blomberg, N.; Mikheenko, A.; Carcole, M.; Coneys, R.; Zhou, L.; Mohammed, Y.; Olivier-Jimenez, D.; Atilano, M. L.; Niccoli, T.; Coyne, A. N.; van der Kant, R.; Lashley, T.; Giera, M.; Partridge, L.; Isaacs, A. M.\nScore: 42.9, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575677\nWe report a conserved transcriptomic signature of reduced fatty acid and lipid metabolism gene expression in human post-mortem ALS spinal cord and a Drosophila model of the most common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, a repeat expansion in C9orf72. To investigate lipid alterations, we performed lipidomics on C9FTD/ALS iPSC-neurons and post-mortem FTLD brain tissue. This revealed a common and specific reduction in phospholipid species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). To determine whether this PUFA deficit contributes to neurodegeneration, we fed C9FTD/ALS flies PUFAs, which yielded a modest increase in survival. However, increasing PUFA levels specifically in neurons of the C9orf72 flies, by overexpressing fatty acid desaturase enzymes, led to a substantial extension of lifespan. Neuronal overexpression of fatty acid desaturases also suppressed stressor induced neuronal death in C9FTD/ALS patient iPSC-neurons. These data implicate neuronal fatty acid saturation in the pathogenesis of FTD/ALS and suggest that interventions to increase PUFA levels specifically within neurons will be beneficial.\nThe inevitability and superfluousness of cell types in spatial cognition\nAuthors: Luo, X.; Mok, R. M.; Love, B. C.\nScore: 37.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575026\nDiscoveries of functional cell types, exemplified by the cataloging of spatial cells in the hippocampal formation, are heralded as scientific breakthroughs. We question whether the identification of cell types based on human intuitions has scientific merit and suggest that \"spatial cells\" may arise in non-spatial computations of sufficient complexity. We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) for object recognition, which lack spatial grounding, contain numerous units resembling place, border, and head-direction cells. Strikingly, even untrained DNNs with randomized weights contained such units and support decoding of spatial information. Moreover, when these \"spatial\" units are excluded, spatial information can be decoded from the remaining DNN units, which highlights the superfluousness of cell types to spatial cognition. Now that large-scale simulations are feasible, the complexity of the brain should be respected and intuitive notions of cell type, which can be misleading and arise in any complex network, should be relegated to history.\nMolecular and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex at single-cell resolution\nAuthors: Wang, L.; Wang, C.; Moriano, J. A.; Chen, S.; Zhang, S.; Mukhtar, T.; Wang, S.; Cebrian-Silla, A.; Bi, Q.; Augustin, J. J.; de Oliveira, L. G.; Song, M.; Ge, X.; Zuo, G.; Paredes, M. F.; Huang, E. J.; Alvarez-Buylla, A.; Duan, X.; Li, J.; Kriegstein, A. R.\nScore: 32.4, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575956\nThe development of the human neocortex is a highly dynamic process and involves complex cellular trajectories controlled by cell-type-specific gene regulation1. Here, we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalog cell type-, age-, and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification, and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in the human neocortex. Specifically, we find a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype termed Tri-IPC responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale GWAS data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched ASD risk in second-trimester intratelencephalic projection neurons. Our study sheds light on the gene regulatory landscape and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex.\nEmergence of neocortical function in heterotopic neurons\nAuthors: Roig-Puiggros, S.; Guyoton, M.; Suchkov, D.; Fortoul, A.; Fievre, S.; Matteucci, G.; Maino, E.; Foucher, C. G.; Fuciec, D.; Klingler, E.; Francis, F.; Minlebaev, M.; El-Boustani, S.; Watrin, F.; Manent, J.-B.; Jabaudon, D.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576031\nBrains come in various sizes and shapes, yet how neuronal position constrains the type of circuits that they can form remains largely unknown. The spatial layout of anatomical structures with corresponding functions varies widely across species (J-4). Also, during evolution, anatomical structures have duplicated and then diverged to generate new circuits and functions (5, 6). Thus, it is critical to understand how the position of neurons constrains their integration into circuits and, ultimately, their function. To address this question, we studied EmlJ knockout mice in which subsets of neocortical neurons form a new structure below the neocortex termed heterotopia (Ht). We examined how this new location affects the molecular identity, topography, input-output circuit connectivity, electrophysiology, and functional properties of these neurons. Our results reveal a striking conservation of the cellular features and circuit properties of Ht neurons, despite their abnormal location and misorientation. Supporting this observation, these neurons were able to functionally substitute for overlying neocortical neurons in a behaviorally relevant task when the latter were optogenetically silenced. Hence, specific neuronal identities and associated function can be reproduced in altered anatomical settings, revealing a remarkable level of self-organization and adaptability of neocortical circuits.\nBrainLM: A foundation model for brain activity recordings\nAuthors: Ortega Caro, J.; Oliveira Fonseca, A. H.; Averill, C.; Rizvi, S. A.; Rosati, M.; Cross, J. L.; Mittal, P.; Zappala, E.; Levine, D.; Dhodapkar, R. M.; Han, I.; Karbasi, A.; Abdallah, C. G.; van Dijk, D.\nScore: 91.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557460\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe introduce the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), a foundation model for brain activity dynamics trained on 6,700 hours of fMRI recordings. Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, BrainLM demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the accurate prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and PTSD as well as forecasting of future brain states. Critically, the model generalizes well to entirely new external cohorts not seen during training. In zero-shot inference mode, BrainLM can identify intrinsic functional networks directly from raw fMRI data without any network-based supervision during training. The model also generates interpretable latent representations that reveal relationships between brain activity patterns and cognitive states. Overall, BrainLM offers a versatile and interpretable framework for elucidating the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity. It serves as a powerful \"lens\" through which massive repositories of fMRI data can be analyzed in new ways, enabling more effective interpretation and utilization at scale. The work demonstrates the potential of foundation models to advance computational neuroscience research.\nThe lateral habenula integrates age and experience to promote social transitions in developing rats\nAuthors: Cobb-Lewis, D. E.; George, A.; Hu, S.; Packard, K.; Song, M.; Nguyen-Lopez, O.; Tesone, E. I.; Rowden, J.; Wang, J.; Opendak, M.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575446\nSocial behavior deficits are an early-emerging marker of psychopathology and are linked with early caregiving quality. However, the infant neural substrates linking early care to social development are poorly understood. Here, we focused on the infant lateral habenula (LHb), a highly-conserved brain region at the nexus between forebrain and monoaminergic circuits. Despite its consistent links to adult psychopathology, this brain region has been understudied in development when the brain is most vulnerable to environmental impacts. In a task combining social and threat cues, suppressing LHb principal neurons had opposing effects in infants versus juveniles, suggesting the LHb promotes a developmental switch in social approach behavior under threat. We observed that early caregiving adversity (ECA) disrupts typical growth curves of LHb baseline structure and function, including volume, firing patterns, neuromodulatory receptor expression, and functional connectivity with cortical regions. Further, we observed that suppressing cortical projections to the LHb rescued social approach deficits following ECA, identifying this microcircuit as a substrate for disrupted social behavior. Together, these results identify immediate biomarkers of ECA in the LHb and highlight this region as a site of early social processing and behavior control.\nSensory Input, Sex, and Function Shape Hypothalamic Cell Type Development\nAuthors: Kaplan, H. S.; Logeman, B. L.; Zhang, K.; Santiago, C.; Sohail, N.; Naumenko, S.; Ho Sui, S. J.; Ginty, D. D.; Ren, B.; Dulac, C.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576835\nMammalian behavior and physiology undergo dramatic changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.\nAstrocytic CREB in nucleus accumbens promotes susceptibility to chronic stress\nAuthors: Holt, L. M.; Gyles, T. M.; Parise, E. M.; Minier-Toribio, A.; Markovic, T.; Rivera, M.; Yeh, S.-Y.; Nestler, E. J.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575728\nBackgroundIncreasing evidence implicates astrocytes in stress and depression in both rodent models and human Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite this, little is known about the transcriptional responses to stress of astrocytes within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, and their influence on behavioral outcomes. MethodsWe used whole cell sorting, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses to investigate the NAc astrocyte transcriptome in male mice in response to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine stress-induced changes in astrocytic CREB within the NAc. Finally, astrocytic regulation of depression-like behavior was investigated using viral-mediated manipulation of CREB in combination with CSDS. ResultsWe found a robust transcriptional response in NAc astrocytes to CSDS in stressed mice, with changes seen in both stress-susceptible and stress-resilient animals. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB, a transcription factor widely studied in neurons, as one of the top-predicted upstream regulators of the NAc astrocyte transcriptome, with opposite activation states seen in resilient versus susceptible mice. This bioinformatic result was confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemistry. Viral overexpression of CREB selectively in NAc astrocytes promoted susceptibility to chronic stress. ConclusionsTogether, our data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to CSDS and, for the first time, that transcriptional regulation in astrocytes contributes to depressive-like behaviors. A better understanding of transcriptional regulation in astrocytes may reveal unknown molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.\nOpioid-driven disruption of the septal complex reveals a role for neurotensin- expressing neurons in withdrawal\nAuthors: Simon, R.; Fleming, W.; Senthilkumar, P.; Briones, B.; Ishii, K.; Hjort, M.; Martin, M.; Hashikawa, K.; Sanders, A.; Golden, S.; Stuber, G.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575766\nBecause opioid withdrawal is an intensely aversive experience, persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) often relapse to avoid it. The lateral septum (LS) is a forebrain structure that is important in aversion processing, and previous studies have linked the lateral septum (LS) to substance use disorders. It is unclear, however, which precise LS cell types might contribute to the maladaptive state of withdrawal. To address this, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to interrogate cell type specific gene expression changes induced by chronic morphine and withdrawal. We discovered that morphine globally disrupted the transcriptional profile of LS cell types, but Neurotensin-expressing neurons (Nts; LS-Nts neurons) were selectively activated by naloxone. Using two-photon calcium imaging and ex vivo electrophysiology, we next demonstrate that LS-Nts neurons receive enhanced glutamatergic drive in morphine-dependent mice and remain hyperactivated during opioid withdrawal. Finally, we showed that activating and silencing LS-Nts neurons during opioid withdrawal regulates pain coping behaviors and sociability. Together, these results suggest that LS-Nts neurons are a key neural substrate involved in opioid withdrawal and establish the LS as a crucial regulator of adaptive behaviors, specifically pertaining to OUD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The human cerebellum is activated by a wide variety of cognitive and motor tasks. Previous functional atlases have relied on single task-based or resting-state fMRI datasets. Here, we present a functional atlas that integrates information from 7 large-scale datasets, outperforming existing group atlasses. The new atlas has three further advantages: First, the regions are hierarchically organized across 3 levels, allowing analyses at the appropriate level of granularity. Second, we provide both asymmetric and symmetric versions of the atlas. The symmetric version, which is obtained by constraining the boundaries to be the same across hemispheres, is especially useful in studying functional lateralization. Finally, the atlas allows for precision mapping in individuals: The integration of the probabilistic group atlas with an individual localizer scan results in a marked improvement in prediction of individual boundaries. Overall, the new atlas is an important resource for the study of the interdigitated functional organization of the human cerebellum in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We report a conserved transcriptomic signature of reduced fatty acid and lipid metabolism gene expression in human post-mortem ALS spinal cord and a Drosophila model of the most common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, a repeat expansion in C9orf72. To investigate lipid alterations, we performed lipidomics on C9FTD/ALS iPSC-neurons and post-mortem FTLD brain tissue. This revealed a common and specific reduction in phospholipid species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). To determine whether this PUFA deficit contributes to neurodegeneration, we fed C9FTD/ALS flies PUFAs, which yielded a modest increase in survival. However, increasing PUFA levels specifically in neurons of the C9orf72 flies, by overexpressing fatty acid desaturase enzymes, led to a substantial extension of lifespan. Neuronal overexpression of fatty acid desaturases also suppressed stressor induced neuronal death in C9FTD/ALS patient iPSC-neurons. These data implicate neuronal fatty acid saturation in the pathogenesis of FTD/ALS and suggest that interventions to increase PUFA levels specifically within neurons will be beneficial.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Discoveries of functional cell types, exemplified by the cataloging of spatial cells in the hippocampal formation, are heralded as scientific breakthroughs. We question whether the identification of cell types based on human intuitions has scientific merit and suggest that &#34;spatial cells&#34; may arise in non-spatial computations of sufficient complexity. We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) for object recognition, which lack spatial grounding, contain numerous units resembling place, border, and head-direction cells. Strikingly, even untrained DNNs with randomized weights contained such units and support decoding of spatial information. Moreover, when these &#34;spatial&#34; units are excluded, spatial information can be decoded from the remaining DNN units, which highlights the superfluousness of cell types to spatial cognition. Now that large-scale simulations are feasible, the complexity of the brain should be respected and intuitive notions of cell type, which can be misleading and arise in any complex network, should be relegated to history.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development of the human neocortex is a highly dynamic process and involves complex cellular trajectories controlled by cell-type-specific gene regulation1. Here, we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalog cell type-, age-, and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification, and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in the human neocortex. Specifically, we find a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype termed Tri-IPC responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale GWAS data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched ASD risk in second-trimester intratelencephalic projection neurons. Our study sheds light on the gene regulatory landscape and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brains come in various sizes and shapes, yet how neuronal position constrains the type of circuits that they can form remains largely unknown. The spatial layout of anatomical structures with corresponding functions varies widely across species (J-4). Also, during evolution, anatomical structures have duplicated and then diverged to generate new circuits and functions (5, 6). Thus, it is critical to understand how the position of neurons constrains their integration into circuits and, ultimately, their function. To address this question, we studied EmlJ knockout mice in which subsets of neocortical neurons form a new structure below the neocortex termed heterotopia (Ht). We examined how this new location affects the molecular identity, topography, input-output circuit connectivity, electrophysiology, and functional properties of these neurons. Our results reveal a striking conservation of the cellular features and circuit properties of Ht neurons, despite their abnormal location and misorientation. Supporting this observation, these neurons were able to functionally substitute for overlying neocortical neurons in a behaviorally relevant task when the latter were optogenetically silenced. Hence, specific neuronal identities and associated function can be reproduced in altered anatomical settings, revealing a remarkable level of self-organization and adaptability of neocortical circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe introduce the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), a foundation model for brain activity dynamics trained on 6,700 hours of fMRI recordings. Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, BrainLM demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the accurate prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and PTSD as well as forecasting of future brain states. Critically, the model generalizes well to entirely new external cohorts not seen during training. In zero-shot inference mode, BrainLM can identify intrinsic functional networks directly from raw fMRI data without any network-based supervision during training. The model also generates interpretable latent representations that reveal relationships between brain activity patterns and cognitive states. Overall, BrainLM offers a versatile and interpretable framework for elucidating the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity. It serves as a powerful &#34;lens&#34; through which massive repositories of fMRI data can be analyzed in new ways, enabling more effective interpretation and utilization at scale. The work demonstrates the potential of foundation models to advance computational neuroscience research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social behavior deficits are an early-emerging marker of psychopathology and are linked with early caregiving quality. However, the infant neural substrates linking early care to social development are poorly understood. Here, we focused on the infant lateral habenula (LHb), a highly-conserved brain region at the nexus between forebrain and monoaminergic circuits. Despite its consistent links to adult psychopathology, this brain region has been understudied in development when the brain is most vulnerable to environmental impacts. In a task combining social and threat cues, suppressing LHb principal neurons had opposing effects in infants versus juveniles, suggesting the LHb promotes a developmental switch in social approach behavior under threat. We observed that early caregiving adversity (ECA) disrupts typical growth curves of LHb baseline structure and function, including volume, firing patterns, neuromodulatory receptor expression, and functional connectivity with cortical regions. Further, we observed that suppressing cortical projections to the LHb rescued social approach deficits following ECA, identifying this microcircuit as a substrate for disrupted social behavior. Together, these results identify immediate biomarkers of ECA in the LHb and highlight this region as a site of early social processing and behavior control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian behavior and physiology undergo dramatic changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIncreasing evidence implicates astrocytes in stress and depression in both rodent models and human Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite this, little is known about the transcriptional responses to stress of astrocytes within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, and their influence on behavioral outcomes.

MethodsWe used whole cell sorting, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses to investigate the NAc astrocyte transcriptome in male mice in response to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine stress-induced changes in astrocytic CREB within the NAc. Finally, astrocytic regulation of depression-like behavior was investigated using viral-mediated manipulation of CREB in combination with CSDS.

ResultsWe found a robust transcriptional response in NAc astrocytes to CSDS in stressed mice, with changes seen in both stress-susceptible and stress-resilient animals. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB, a transcription factor widely studied in neurons, as one of the top-predicted upstream regulators of the NAc astrocyte transcriptome, with opposite activation states seen in resilient versus susceptible mice. This bioinformatic result was confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemistry. Viral overexpression of CREB selectively in NAc astrocytes promoted susceptibility to chronic stress.

ConclusionsTogether, our data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to CSDS and, for the first time, that transcriptional regulation in astrocytes contributes to depressive-like behaviors. A better understanding of transcriptional regulation in astrocytes may reveal unknown molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Because opioid withdrawal is an intensely aversive experience, persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) often relapse to avoid it. The lateral septum (LS) is a forebrain structure that is important in aversion processing, and previous studies have linked the lateral septum (LS) to substance use disorders. It is unclear, however, which precise LS cell types might contribute to the maladaptive state of withdrawal. To address this, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to interrogate cell type specific gene expression changes induced by chronic morphine and withdrawal. We discovered that morphine globally disrupted the transcriptional profile of LS cell types, but Neurotensin-expressing neurons (Nts; LS-Nts neurons) were selectively activated by naloxone. Using two-photon calcium imaging and ex vivo electrophysiology, we next demonstrate that LS-Nts neurons receive enhanced glutamatergic drive in morphine-dependent mice and remain hyperactivated during opioid withdrawal. Finally, we showed that activating and silencing LS-Nts neurons during opioid withdrawal regulates pain coping behaviors and sociability. Together, these results suggest that LS-Nts neurons are a key neural substrate involved in opioid withdrawal and establish the LS as a crucial regulator of adaptive behaviors, specifically pertaining to OUD.</p>
