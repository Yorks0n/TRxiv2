We hypothesize that a mechanism of neural coordination is brain oscillations that propagate as traveling waves across the cortex in distinctive patterns that control when and where different regions interact. To test this hypothesis, we used direct recordings from humans performing multiple memory experiments and a novel analytical framework that measures the directional propagation of oscillations. We found that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in not only plane waves as seen previously, but also in spirals, sources and sinks, and more complex patterns. These traveling wave patterns correlated with various aspects of behavior, with specific propagation patterns reflecting broad cognitive processes, and the identities of specific remembered items. Together, these findings show that complex spatiotemporal patterns of traveling waves underlie human cognition and are relevant practically for neural decoding and brain-computer interfacing.\nAdult sex change leads to extensive forebrain reorganization in clownfish\nAuthors: Parker, C. G.; Gruenhagen, G. W.; Hegarty, B. E.; Histed, A. R.; Streelman, J. T.; Rhodes, J. S.; Johnson, Z. V.\nScore: 40.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577753\nSexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish. Significance StatementThis study provides key insights into brain sex differences in sex-changing anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris), a species that changes sex in adulthood in response to the social environment. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, the study provides the first brain cellular atlas showing sex differences in two crucial reproductive areas: the preoptic area and telencephalon. The research identifies notable sex-differences in cell-type proportions and gene expression, particularly in radial glia and glutamatergic neurons that co-express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. It also highlights differences in preoptic area neurons likely involved in gonadal regulation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation of the brain in vertebrates, especially those capable of adult sex change, and illuminates key molecular and cellular beginning and endpoints of the process.\nDual-targeting CRISPR-CasRx reduces C9orf72 ALS/FTD sense and antisense repeat RNAs in vitro and in vivo\nAuthors: Kempthorne, L.; Vaizoglu, D.; Cammack, A.

M.\nScore: 27.2, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577366\nThe most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a G4C2 repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.\nArc mediates intercellular synaptic plasticity via IRSp53-dependent extracellular vesicle biogenesis.\nAuthors: Ravens, A.; Sullivan, K.; Einstein, J.; Keceli, S. K.; Kicmal, T.; Tyagi, M.; Hantak, M. P.; Shepherd, T.; Stewart, A.; Lyon, K.; Dharan, A.; Gallagher, T.; Campbell, E. M.; Shepherd, J. D.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578027\nCurrent models of learning and memory have focused on cell-autonomous regulation of synaptic strength; however, intercellular signaling between cells in the brain is critical for normal cognition. The immediate early gene Arc is a repurposed retrotransposon critical for long-term forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Arc protein forms virus-like capsids released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that signal cell-to-cell. Here, we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) stimuli induce the biogenesis of Arc EVs by recruiting the I-BAR protein IRSp53 to dendrites, which facilitates Arc capsid assembly and release. Arc EVs transfer Arc protein and mRNA to neighboring neurons, where translation of transferred Arc mRNA induces a loss of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These results show that Arc EVs mediate non-cell autonomous long-term depression (LTD), revealing an intercellular form of synaptic plasticity that may be critical for memory consolidation.\nMitochondrial Ca2+ efflux controls neuronal metabolism and long-term memory across species\nAuthors: Vishwanath, A.

We find that reducing the expression of the mitochondrial H+/Ca2+ exchanger Letm1 results in increased Ca2+ retention in the mitochondrial matrix of firing neurons, which overactivates neuronal metabolism in flies and rodents. We find that upscaled metabolic states in active neurons of central memory circuits of flies and mice enable storing long-term memories in training paradigms in which wild-type counterparts of both species fail to remember. Our findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that controls mitochondrial metabolism in active neurons and prove its crucial role in governing higher brain functions, such as long-term memory formation. Highlights- Letm1 controls activity-driven mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux in neurons - Increased mitochondrial Ca2+ retention during activity overactivates neuronal metabolism - Activity-driven upscaling of neuronal metabolism facilitates long-term olfactory memory in flies and mice\nAn inductive bias for slowly changing features in human reinforcement learning\nAuthors: Hedrich, N. L.; Schulz, E.; Hall-McMaster, S.; Schuck, N. W.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576910\nIdentifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 100 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Participants accrued more reward and achieved better generalisation to unseen feature values when a bandits relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. Participants were also more likely to incorrectly base their choices on the irrelevant feature when it changed slowly versus quickly. These effects were stronger when participants experienced the feature speed before learning about rewards. Modelling this behaviour with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. Author SummaryLearning experiments in the laboratory are often assumed to exist in a vacuum, where participants solve a given task independently of how they learn in more natural circumstances. But humans and other animals are in fact well known to \"meta learn\", i.e. to leverage generalisable assumptions about how to learn from other experiences. Taking inspiration from a well-known machine learning technique known as slow feature analysis, we investigated one specific instance of such an assumption in learning: the possibility that humans tend to focus on slowly rather than quickly changing features when learning about rewards. To test this, we developed a task where participants had to learn the value of stimuli composed of two features. Participants indeed learned better from a slowly rather than quickly changing feature that predicted reward and were more distracted by the reward-irrelevant feature when it changed slowly. Computational modelling of participant behaviour indicated that participants had a higher learning rate for slowly changing features from the outset. Hence, our results support the idea that human reinforcement learning reflects a priori assumptions about the reward structure in natural environments.\nGut Analysis Toolbox: Automating quantitative analysis of enteric neurons\nAuthors: Sorensen, L.; Humenick, A.; Poon, S.

H.; Kaltschmidt, J. A.; Munoz-Barrutia, A.; King, S. K.; Veldhuis, N. A.; Carbone, S. E.; Poole, D. P.; Rajasekhar, P.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576140\nThe enteric nervous system (ENS) plays an important role in coordinating gut function. The ENS consists of an extensive network of neurons and glial cells within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Alterations in neuronal distribution, function, and type are strongly associated with enteric neuropathies and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and can serve as biomarkers for disease. However, current methods for assessing neuronal counts and distribution suffer from undersampling. This is partly due to challenges associated with imaging and analyzing large tissue areas, and operator bias due to manual analysis. Here, we present the Gut Analysis Toolbox (GAT), an image analysis tool designed for characterization of enteric neurons and their neurochemical coding using 2D images of GI wholemount preparations. GAT is developed for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. It has a user-friendly interface and offers rapid and accurate cell segmentation. Custom deep learning (DL) based cell segmentation models were developed using StarDist. GAT also includes a ganglion segmentation model which was developed using deepImageJ. In addition, GAT allows importing of segmentation generated by other software. DL models have been trained using ZeroCostDL4Mic on diverse datasets sourced from different laboratories. This captures the variability associated with differences in animal species, image acquisition parameters, and sample preparation across research groups. We demonstrate the robustness of the cell segmentation DL models by comparing them against the state-of-the-art cell segmentation software, Cellpose. To quantify neuronal distribution GAT applies proximal neighbor-based spatial analysis. We demonstrate how the proximal neighbor analysis can reveal differences in cellular distribution across gut regions using a published dataset. In summary, GAT provides an easy-to-use toolbox to streamline routine image analysis tasks in ENS research. GAT enhances throughput allowing unbiased analysis of larger tissue areas, multiple neuronal markers and numerous samples rapidly.\nFormation of long-term memory without short-term memory by CaMKII inhibition\nAuthors: Shin, M. E.; Parra-Bueno, P.; Yasuda, R.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577644\nMost of the current models of long-term memory consolidation require prior establishment of short-term memory. Here, we show that optogenetic or genetic inhibition of CaMKII, a kinase important for synaptic plasticity, in an inhibitory avoidance task impairs short-term memory at 1 h but not long-term memory at 1 d. Similarly, cortico-amygdala synaptic potentiation was more sensitive to CaMKII inhibition at 1 h but not at 1 d. These results strongly suggest that long-term memory does not require the prior formation of short-term memory and that CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity specifically regulates short-term memory, but not long-term memory, for avoidance memory.\nA deep-learning strategy to identify cell types across species from high-density extracellular recordings\nAuthors: Beau, M.; Herzfeld, D.

F.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577845\nHigh-density probes allow electrophysiological recordings from many neurons simultaneously across entire brain circuits but fail to determine each recorded neurons cell type. Here, we develop a strategy to identify cell types from extracellular recordings in awake animals, opening avenues to unveil the computational roles of neurons with distinct functional, molecular, and anatomical properties. We combine optogenetic activation and pharmacology using the cerebellum as a testbed to generate a curated ground-truth library of electrophysiological properties for Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, Golgi cells, and mossy fibers. We train a semi-supervised deep-learning classifier that predicts cell types with greater than 95% accuracy based on waveform, discharge statistics, and layer of the recorded neuron. The classifiers predictions agree with expert classification on recordings using different probes, in different laboratories, from functionally distinct cerebellar regions, and across animal species. Our approach provides a general blueprint for cell-type identification from extracellular recordings across the brain.\nInferring neural dynamics of memory during naturalistic social communication\nAuthors: Pang, R.; Baker, C. A.; Murthy, M.; Pillow, J. W.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577404\nMemory processes in complex behaviors like social communication require forming representations of the past that grow with time. The neural mechanisms that support such continually growing memory remain unknown. We address this gap in the context of fly courtship, a natural social behavior involving the production and perception of long, complex song sequences. To study female memory for male song history in unrestrained courtship, we present Natural Continuation (NC)--a general, simulation-based model comparison procedure to evaluate candidate neural codes for complex stimuli using naturalistic behavioral data. Applying NC to fly courtship revealed strong evidence for an adaptive population mechanism for how female auditory neural dynamics could convert long song histories into a rich mnemonic format. Song temporal patterning is continually transformed by heterogeneous nonlinear adaptation dynamics, then integrated into persistent activity, enabling common neural mechanisms to retain continuously unfolding information over long periods and yielding state-of-the-art predictions of female courtship behavior. At a population level this coding model produces multi-dimensional advection-diffusion-like responses that separate songs over a continuum of timescales and can be linearly transformed into flexible output signals, illustrating its potential to create a generic, scalable mnemonic format for extended input signals poised to drive complex behavioral responses. This work thus shows how naturalistic behavior can directly inform neural population coding models, revealing here a novel process for memory formation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is explaining how widespread brain regions flexibly interact to support behaviors. We hypothesize that a mechanism of neural coordination is brain oscillations that propagate as traveling waves across the cortex in distinctive patterns that control when and where different regions interact. To test this hypothesis, we used direct recordings from humans performing multiple memory experiments and a novel analytical framework that measures the directional propagation of oscillations. We found that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in not only plane waves as seen previously, but also in spirals, sources and sinks, and more complex patterns. These traveling wave patterns correlated with various aspects of behavior, with specific propagation patterns reflecting broad cognitive processes, and the identities of specific remembered items. Together, these findings show that complex spatiotemporal patterns of traveling waves underlie human cognition and are relevant practically for neural decoding and brain-computer interfacing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sexual differentiation of the brain occurs in all major vertebrate lineages but is not well understood at a molecular and cellular level. Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation. This study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain. We uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of neurosexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish.

Significance StatementThis study provides key insights into brain sex differences in sex-changing anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris), a species that changes sex in adulthood in response to the social environment. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, the study provides the first brain cellular atlas showing sex differences in two crucial reproductive areas: the preoptic area and telencephalon. The research identifies notable sex-differences in cell-type proportions and gene expression, particularly in radial glia and glutamatergic neurons that co-express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. It also highlights differences in preoptic area neurons likely involved in gonadal regulation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation of the brain in vertebrates, especially those capable of adult sex change, and illuminates key molecular and cellular beginning and endpoints of the process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a G4C2 repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current models of learning and memory have focused on cell-autonomous regulation of synaptic strength; however, intercellular signaling between cells in the brain is critical for normal cognition. The immediate early gene Arc is a repurposed retrotransposon critical for long-term forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Arc protein forms virus-like capsids released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that signal cell-to-cell. Here, we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) stimuli induce the biogenesis of Arc EVs by recruiting the I-BAR protein IRSp53 to dendrites, which facilitates Arc capsid assembly and release. Arc EVs transfer Arc protein and mRNA to neighboring neurons, where translation of transferred Arc mRNA induces a loss of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These results show that Arc EVs mediate non-cell autonomous long-term depression (LTD), revealing an intercellular form of synaptic plasticity that may be critical for memory consolidation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While impairing neuronal metabolism limits brain performance, it remains poorly understood whether enhancing metabolism in neurons, in contrast, could boost brain function. We find that reducing the expression of the mitochondrial H&#43;/Ca2&#43; exchanger Letm1 results in increased Ca2&#43; retention in the mitochondrial matrix of firing neurons, which overactivates neuronal metabolism in flies and rodents. We find that upscaled metabolic states in active neurons of central memory circuits of flies and mice enable storing long-term memories in training paradigms in which wild-type counterparts of both species fail to remember. Our findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that controls mitochondrial metabolism in active neurons and prove its crucial role in governing higher brain functions, such as long-term memory formation.

Highlights- Letm1 controls activity-driven mitochondrial Ca2&#43; efflux in neurons
- Increased mitochondrial Ca2&#43; retention during activity overactivates neuronal metabolism
- Activity-driven upscaling of neuronal metabolism facilitates long-term olfactory memory in flies and mice</p>

        <p class="abstract">Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 100 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Participants accrued more reward and achieved better generalisation to unseen feature values when a bandits relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. Participants were also more likely to incorrectly base their choices on the irrelevant feature when it changed slowly versus quickly. These effects were stronger when participants experienced the feature speed before learning about rewards. Modelling this behaviour with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

Author SummaryLearning experiments in the laboratory are often assumed to exist in a vacuum, where participants solve a given task independently of how they learn in more natural circumstances. But humans and other animals are in fact well known to &#34;meta learn&#34;, i.e. to leverage generalisable assumptions about how to learn from other experiences. Taking inspiration from a well-known machine learning technique known as slow feature analysis, we investigated one specific instance of such an assumption in learning: the possibility that humans tend to focus on slowly rather than quickly changing features when learning about rewards. To test this, we developed a task where participants had to learn the value of stimuli composed of two features. Participants indeed learned better from a slowly rather than quickly changing feature that predicted reward and were more distracted by the reward-irrelevant feature when it changed slowly. Computational modelling of participant behaviour indicated that participants had a higher learning rate for slowly changing features from the outset. Hence, our results support the idea that human reinforcement learning reflects a priori assumptions about the reward structure in natural environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays an important role in coordinating gut function. The ENS consists of an extensive network of neurons and glial cells within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Alterations in neuronal distribution, function, and type are strongly associated with enteric neuropathies and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and can serve as biomarkers for disease. However, current methods for assessing neuronal counts and distribution suffer from undersampling. This is partly due to challenges associated with imaging and analyzing large tissue areas, and operator bias due to manual analysis. Here, we present the Gut Analysis Toolbox (GAT), an image analysis tool designed for characterization of enteric neurons and their neurochemical coding using 2D images of GI wholemount preparations. GAT is developed for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. It has a user-friendly interface and offers rapid and accurate cell segmentation. Custom deep learning (DL) based cell segmentation models were developed using StarDist. GAT also includes a ganglion segmentation model which was developed using deepImageJ. In addition, GAT allows importing of segmentation generated by other software. DL models have been trained using ZeroCostDL4Mic on diverse datasets sourced from different laboratories. This captures the variability associated with differences in animal species, image acquisition parameters, and sample preparation across research groups. We demonstrate the robustness of the cell segmentation DL models by comparing them against the state-of-the-art cell segmentation software, Cellpose. To quantify neuronal distribution GAT applies proximal neighbor-based spatial analysis. We demonstrate how the proximal neighbor analysis can reveal differences in cellular distribution across gut regions using a published dataset. In summary, GAT provides an easy-to-use toolbox to streamline routine image analysis tasks in ENS research. GAT enhances throughput allowing unbiased analysis of larger tissue areas, multiple neuronal markers and numerous samples rapidly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most of the current models of long-term memory consolidation require prior establishment of short-term memory. Here, we show that optogenetic or genetic inhibition of CaMKII, a kinase important for synaptic plasticity, in an inhibitory avoidance task impairs short-term memory at 1 h but not long-term memory at 1 d. Similarly, cortico-amygdala synaptic potentiation was more sensitive to CaMKII inhibition at 1 h but not at 1 d. These results strongly suggest that long-term memory does not require the prior formation of short-term memory and that CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity specifically regulates short-term memory, but not long-term memory, for avoidance memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High-density probes allow electrophysiological recordings from many neurons simultaneously across entire brain circuits but fail to determine each recorded neurons cell type. Here, we develop a strategy to identify cell types from extracellular recordings in awake animals, opening avenues to unveil the computational roles of neurons with distinct functional, molecular, and anatomical properties. We combine optogenetic activation and pharmacology using the cerebellum as a testbed to generate a curated ground-truth library of electrophysiological properties for Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, Golgi cells, and mossy fibers. We train a semi-supervised deep-learning classifier that predicts cell types with greater than 95% accuracy based on waveform, discharge statistics, and layer of the recorded neuron. The classifiers predictions agree with expert classification on recordings using different probes, in different laboratories, from functionally distinct cerebellar regions, and across animal species. Our approach provides a general blueprint for cell-type identification from extracellular recordings across the brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memory processes in complex behaviors like social communication require forming representations of the past that grow with time. The neural mechanisms that support such continually growing memory remain unknown. We address this gap in the context of fly courtship, a natural social behavior involving the production and perception of long, complex song sequences. To study female memory for male song history in unrestrained courtship, we present  Natural Continuation (NC)--a general, simulation-based model comparison procedure to evaluate candidate neural codes for complex stimuli using naturalistic behavioral data. Applying NC to fly courtship revealed strong evidence for an adaptive population mechanism for how female auditory neural dynamics could convert long song histories into a rich mnemonic format. Song temporal patterning is continually transformed by heterogeneous nonlinear adaptation dynamics, then integrated into persistent activity, enabling common neural mechanisms to retain continuously unfolding information over long periods and yielding state-of-the-art predictions of female courtship behavior. At a population level this coding model produces multi-dimensional advection-diffusion-like responses that separate songs over a continuum of timescales and can be linearly transformed into flexible output signals, illustrating its potential to create a generic, scalable mnemonic format for extended input signals poised to drive complex behavioral responses. This work thus shows how naturalistic behavior can directly inform neural population coding models, revealing here a novel process for memory formation.</p>
