F.; Brusaferri, L.; Kim, M.; Saadi, D.; Ratai, E.-M.; Dougherty, D. D.; Loggia, M. L.\nScore: 1054.7, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563117\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.\nMenstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and grey matter architecture changes across the whole brain\nAuthors: Rizor, E. J.; Babenko, V.; Dundon, N. M.; Beverly-Aylwin, R.; Stump, A.; Hayes, M.; Herschenfeld-Catalan, L.; Jacobs, E. G.; Grafton, S. T.\nScore: 296.3, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561616\nCyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.\nIntegrating brainstem and cortical functional architectures\nAuthors: Hansen, J. Y.; Cauzzo, S.; Singh, K.; Garcia-Gomar, M. G.; Shine, J. M.; Bianciardi, M.; Misic, B.\nScore: 56.4, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564245\nThe brainstem is a fundamental component of the central nervous system yet it is typically excluded from in vivo human brain mapping efforts, precluding a complete understanding of how the brainstem influences cortical function. Here we use high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI to derive a functional connectome encompassing cortex as well as 58 brainstem nuclei spanning the midbrain, pons and medulla. We identify a compact set of integrative hubs in the brainstem with widespread connectivity with cerebral cortex. Patterns of connectivity between brainstem and cerebral cortex manifest as multiple emergent phenomena including neurophysiological oscillatory rhythms, patterns of cognitive functional specialization, and the unimodal-transmodal functional hierarchy. This persistent alignment between cortical functional topographies and brainstem nuclei is shaped by the spatial arrangement of multiple neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. We replicate all findings using 3 Tesla data from the same participants. Collectively, we find that multiple organizational features of cortical activity can be traced back to the brainstem.\nCaveolin-1 mediates neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Trevino, T. N.; Fogel, A. B.; Minshall, R.; Richner, J. M.; Lutz, S. E.\nScore: 193.3, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.563024\nLeukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3+ T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.\nDevelopment of neural circuits for social motion perception in schooling fish\nAuthors: Zada, D.; Schulze, L.; Yu, J.-H.; Tarabishi, P.; Napoli, J. L.; Lovett-Barron, M.\nScore: 50.8, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563839\nMany animals move in groups, where collective behavior emerges from the interactions amongst individuals. These social interactions produce the coordinated movements of bird flocks and fish schools, but little is known about their developmental emergence and neurobiological foundations. By characterizing the visually-based schooling behavior of the micro glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we found that social development progresses sequentially, with animals first acquiring the ability to aggregate, followed by postural alignment with social partners. This social maturation was accompanied by the development of neural populations in the midbrain and forebrain that were preferentially driven by visual stimuli that resemble the shape and movements of schooling fish. The development of these neural circuits enables the social coordination required for collective movement. One-Sentence SummaryThe collective behavior of schooling fish emerges with the development of neural populations selective to social motion.\nThe biological role of local and global fMRI BOLD signal variability in human brain organization\nAuthors: Baracchini, G.; Zhou, Y.; Castanheira, J. d. S.; Hansen, J. Y.; Rieck, J. R.; Turner, G. R.; Grady, C. L.; Misic, B.; Nomi, J.; Uddin, L. Q.; Spreng, R. N.\nScore: 46.4, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563476\nVariability drives the organization and behavior of complex systems, including the human brain. Understanding the variability of brain signals is thus necessary to broaden our window into brain function and behavior. Few empirical investigations of macroscale brain signal variability have yet been undertaken, given the difficulty in separating biological sources of variance from artefactual noise. Here, we characterize the temporal variability of the most predominant macroscale brain signal, the fMRI BOLD signal, and systematically investigate its statistical, topographical and neurobiological properties. We contrast fMRI acquisition protocols, and integrate across histology, microstructure, transcriptomics, neurotransmitter receptor and metabolic data, fMRI static connectivity, and empirical and simulated magnetoencephalography data. We show that BOLD signal variability represents a spatially heterogeneous, central property of multi-scale multi-modal brain organization, distinct from noise. Our work establishes the biological relevance of BOLD signal variability and provides a lens on brain stochasticity across spatial and temporal scales.\nGut microbiota promotes pain in fibromyalgia\nAuthors: Cai, W.; Haddad, M.; Haddad, R.; Kesten, I.; Hoffman, T.; Laan, R.; Wong, W.; Brown, N.; Tansley, S.; Lister, K. C.; Hooshmandi, M.; Wang, F.; Sharif, B.; Westfall, S.; Sahar, T.; Clayton, C.; Wu, N.; Zhang, J.; Bar-Yoseph, H.; Pitashny, M.; Mogil, J. S.; Prager-Khoutorsky, M.; Seguela, P.; King, I. L.; De Koninck, Y.; Brereton, N. J. B.; Gonzalez, E.; Shir, Y.; Minerbi, A.; Khoutorsky, A.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563794\nFibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain in the absence of evident tissue injury or pathology, making it one of the most mysterious chronic pain conditions. Despite affecting 2-4% of the population, primarily women, the cause and underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia remain elusive, and effective targeted treatments are currently unavailable. The gut microbiota of women with fibromyalgia differs from healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether changes in gut microbiota have a causal role in mediating pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Here, we show that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from individuals with fibromyalgia, but not from healthy controls, into germ-free mice induces persistent pain hypersensitivity. FMT from fibromyalgia patients led to a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density and alterations in the peripheral immune profile, and induced activation of spinal microglia, which contributed to the development of pain in mice. Notably, the pain hypersensitivity in mice that were administered microbiota from fibromyalgia patients resolved after FMT from healthy controls. Consistent with these findings, an open-label pilot study showed that transplanting microbiota from healthy individuals to humans with fibromyalgia alleviated pain and reduced overall symptom severity. Thus, altered gut microbiota has a causal role in fibromyalgia pain, highlighting it as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.\nDAP12 deficiency alters microglia-oligodendrocyte communication and enhances resilience against tau toxicity\nAuthors: Luo, W.; Che, H.; Fan, L.; Guo, Q.; Wong, M. Y.; Yu, F.; Foxe, N.; Wang, W.; Nessim, A.; Carling, G.; Liu, B.; Lopez-Lee, C.; Huang, Y.; Amin, S.; Patel, T.; Mok, S.-A.; Song, W.-m.; Zhang, B.; Ma, Q.; Fu, H.; Gan, L.\nScore: 28.9, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.563970\nPathogenic tau accumulation fuels neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Enhancing aging brain resilience to tau pathology would lead to novel therapeutic strategies. DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein 12) is critically involved in microglial immune responses. Previous studies have showed that mice lacking DAP12 in tauopathy mice exhibit higher tau pathology but are protected from tau-induced cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Our current study uncovers a novel resilience mechanism via microglial interaction with oligodendrocytes. Despite higher tau inclusions, Dap12 deletion curbs tau-induced brain inflammation and ameliorates myelin and synapse loss. Specifically, removal of Dap12 abolished tau-induced disease-associated clusters in microglia (MG) and intermediate oligodendrocytes (iOli), which are spatially correlated with tau pathology in AD brains. Our study highlights the critical role of interactions between microglia and oligodendrocytes in tau toxicity and DAP12 signaling as a promising target for enhancing resilience in AD.\nPresynaptic inhibition selectively suppresses leg proprioception in behaving Drosophila\nAuthors: Dallmann, C. J.; Agrawal, S.; Cook, A.; Brunton, B. W.; Tuthill, J. C.\nScore: 45.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563322\nThe sense of proprioception is mediated by internal mechanosensory neurons that detect joint position and movement. To support a diverse range of functions, from stabilizing posture to coordinating movements, proprioceptive feedback to limb motor control circuits must be tuned in a context-dependent manner. How proprioceptive feedback signals are tuned to match behavioral demands remains poorly understood. Using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons of movementencoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons are active during self-generated but not passive leg movements and receive input from descending neurons, suggesting they are driven by predictions of leg movement originating in the brain. Predictively suppressing expected proprioceptive feedback provides a mechanism to attenuate reflexes that would otherwise interfere with voluntary movement.\nRNA aptamer reveals nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early aggregation event that coincides with STMN-2 cryptic splicing and precedes clinical manifestation in ALS\nAuthors: Spence, H.; Waldron, F.

H.; Gregory, J.\nScore: 21.3, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563701\nTDP-43 is an aggregation-prone protein which accumulates in the hallmark pathological inclusions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, analysis of deeply-phenotyped human post-mortem samples has shown that TDP-43 aggregation, revealed by standard antibody methods, correlates poorly with symptom manifestation. Recent identification of cryptic-splicing events, such as the detection of Stathmin-2 (STMN-2) cryptic exons, are providing evidence implicating TDP-43 loss-of-function as a potential driving pathomechanism, but the temporal nature of TDP-43 loss and its relation to the disease process and clinical phenotype is not known. To address these outstanding questions, we used a novel RNA aptamer, TDP-43APT, to detect TDP-43 aggregation and used single molecule in situ hybridization to sensitively reveal TDP-43 loss-of-function and applied these in a deeply-phenotyped human post-mortem tissue cohort. We demonstrate that TDP-43APT identifies pathological TDP-43, detecting aggregation events that cannot be detected by classical antibody stains. We show that nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early event, occurring prior to cytoplasmic aggregation and is associated with loss-of-function measured by coincident STMN-2 cryptic splicing pathology. Crucially, we show that these pathological features of TDP-43 loss-of-function precede the clinical inflection point and are not required for region specific clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gain-of-function in the form of extensive cytoplasmic aggregation, but not loss-of-function, is the primary molecular correlate of clinical manifestation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate implications for early diagnostics as the presence of STMN-2 cryptic exons and early TDP-43 aggregation events could be detected prior to symptom onset, holding promise for early intervention in ALS.

However, the temporal nature of TDP-43 loss and its relation to clinical phenotype is not known.

We show that nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early event, that coincides with STMN-2 cryptic splicing. Crucially, we show that these pathological features of TDP-43 loss-of-function precede the clinical inflection point and are not required for region specific clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gain-of-function, but not loss-of-function, is the primary molecular correlate of clinical manifestation.

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T1-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17{beta}-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (FA), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to cortical thickness. Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing associations with mean diffusivity and cortical thickness. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Lastly, progesterone was associated with increased tissue and decreased CSF volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brainstem is a fundamental component of the central nervous system yet it is typically excluded from in vivo human brain mapping efforts, precluding a complete understanding of how the brainstem influences cortical function. Here we use high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI to derive a functional connectome encompassing cortex as well as 58 brainstem nuclei spanning the midbrain, pons and medulla. We identify a compact set of integrative hubs in the brainstem with widespread connectivity with cerebral cortex. Patterns of connectivity between brainstem and cerebral cortex manifest as multiple emergent phenomena including neurophysiological oscillatory rhythms, patterns of cognitive functional specialization, and the unimodal-transmodal functional hierarchy. This persistent alignment between cortical functional topographies and brainstem nuclei is shaped by the spatial arrangement of multiple neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. We replicate all findings using 3 Tesla data from the same participants. Collectively, we find that multiple organizational features of cortical activity can be traced back to the brainstem.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leukocyte infiltration of the CNS can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Brain endothelial cells regulate adhesion, activation, and diapedesis of T cells across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in inflammatory diseases. The integral membrane protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) critically regulates BBB permeability, but its influence on T cell CNS infiltration in respiratory viral infections is unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Cav-1 at the BBB in neuroinflammation in a COVID-19 mouse model. We used mice genetically deficient in Cav-1 to test the role of this protein in T cell infiltration and cognitive impairment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated brain endothelial Cav-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased brain endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD3&#43; T cell infiltration of the hippocampus, a region important for short term learning and memory. Concordantly, we observed learning and memory deficits. Importantly, genetic deficiency in Cav-1 attenuated brain endothelial VCAM-1 expression and T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Cav-1 KO mice were protected from the learning and memory deficits caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results indicate the importance of BBB permeability in COVID-19 neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic value of targeting Cav-1 to improve disease outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many animals move in groups, where collective behavior emerges from the interactions amongst individuals. These social interactions produce the coordinated movements of bird flocks and fish schools, but little is known about their developmental emergence and neurobiological foundations. By characterizing the visually-based schooling behavior of the micro glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we found that social development progresses sequentially, with animals first acquiring the ability to aggregate, followed by postural alignment with social partners. This social maturation was accompanied by the development of neural populations in the midbrain and forebrain that were preferentially driven by visual stimuli that resemble the shape and movements of schooling fish. The development of these neural circuits enables the social coordination required for collective movement.

One-Sentence SummaryThe collective behavior of schooling fish emerges with the development of neural populations selective to social motion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Variability drives the organization and behavior of complex systems, including the human brain. Understanding the variability of brain signals is thus necessary to broaden our window into brain function and behavior. Few empirical investigations of macroscale brain signal variability have yet been undertaken, given the difficulty in separating biological sources of variance from artefactual noise. Here, we characterize the temporal variability of the most predominant macroscale brain signal, the fMRI BOLD signal, and systematically investigate its statistical, topographical and neurobiological properties. We contrast fMRI acquisition protocols, and integrate across histology, microstructure, transcriptomics, neurotransmitter receptor and metabolic data, fMRI static connectivity, and empirical and simulated magnetoencephalography data. We show that BOLD signal variability represents a spatially heterogeneous, central property of multi-scale multi-modal brain organization, distinct from noise. Our work establishes the biological relevance of BOLD signal variability and provides a lens on brain stochasticity across spatial and temporal scales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain in the absence of evident tissue injury or pathology, making it one of the most mysterious chronic pain conditions. Despite affecting 2-4% of the population, primarily women, the cause and underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia remain elusive, and effective targeted treatments are currently unavailable. The gut microbiota of women with fibromyalgia differs from healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether changes in gut microbiota have a causal role in mediating pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Here, we show that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from individuals with fibromyalgia, but not from healthy controls, into germ-free mice induces persistent pain hypersensitivity. FMT from fibromyalgia patients led to a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density and alterations in the peripheral immune profile, and induced activation of spinal microglia, which contributed to the development of pain in mice. Notably, the pain hypersensitivity in mice that were administered microbiota from fibromyalgia patients resolved after FMT from healthy controls. Consistent with these findings, an open-label pilot study showed that transplanting microbiota from healthy individuals to humans with fibromyalgia alleviated pain and reduced overall symptom severity. Thus, altered gut microbiota has a causal role in fibromyalgia pain, highlighting it as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogenic tau accumulation fuels neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Enhancing aging brain resilience to tau pathology would lead to novel therapeutic strategies. DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein 12) is critically involved in microglial immune responses. Previous studies have showed that mice lacking DAP12 in tauopathy mice exhibit higher tau pathology but are protected from tau-induced cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Our current study uncovers a novel resilience mechanism via microglial interaction with oligodendrocytes. Despite higher tau inclusions, Dap12 deletion curbs tau-induced brain inflammation and ameliorates myelin and synapse loss. Specifically, removal of Dap12 abolished tau-induced disease-associated clusters in microglia (MG) and intermediate oligodendrocytes (iOli), which are spatially correlated with tau pathology in AD brains. Our study highlights the critical role of interactions between microglia and oligodendrocytes in tau toxicity and DAP12 signaling as a promising target for enhancing resilience in AD.</p>

To support a diverse range of functions, from stabilizing posture to coordinating movements, proprioceptive feedback to limb motor control circuits must be tuned in a context-dependent manner. How proprioceptive feedback signals are tuned to match behavioral demands remains poorly understood. Using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons of movementencoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons are active during self-generated but not passive leg movements and receive input from descending neurons, suggesting they are driven by predictions of leg movement originating in the brain. Predictively suppressing expected proprioceptive feedback provides a mechanism to attenuate reflexes that would otherwise interfere with voluntary movement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">TDP-43 is an aggregation-prone protein which accumulates in the hallmark pathological inclusions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, analysis of deeply-phenotyped human post-mortem samples has shown that TDP-43 aggregation, revealed by standard antibody methods, correlates poorly with symptom manifestation. Recent identification of cryptic-splicing events, such as the detection of Stathmin-2 (STMN-2) cryptic exons, are providing evidence implicating TDP-43 loss-of-function as a potential driving pathomechanism, but the temporal nature of TDP-43 loss and its relation to the disease process and clinical phenotype is not known. To address these outstanding questions, we used a novel RNA aptamer, TDP-43APT, to detect TDP-43 aggregation and used single molecule in situ hybridization to sensitively reveal TDP-43 loss-of-function and applied these in a deeply-phenotyped human post-mortem tissue cohort. We demonstrate that TDP-43APT identifies pathological TDP-43, detecting aggregation events that cannot be detected by classical antibody stains. We show that nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early event, occurring prior to cytoplasmic aggregation and is associated with loss-of-function measured by coincident STMN-2 cryptic splicing pathology. Crucially, we show that these pathological features of TDP-43 loss-of-function precede the clinical inflection point and are not required for region specific clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gain-of-function in the form of extensive cytoplasmic aggregation, but not loss-of-function, is the primary molecular correlate of clinical manifestation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate implications for early diagnostics as the presence of STMN-2 cryptic exons and early TDP-43 aggregation events could be detected prior to symptom onset, holding promise for early intervention in ALS.

Short AbstractRecent identification of cryptic-splicing events such as the detection of Stathmin-2 (STMN-2) cryptic exons, are providing evidence implicating TDP-43 loss-of-function as a potential driving pathomechanism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the temporal nature of TDP-43 loss and its relation to clinical phenotype is not known. Here, we used a novel RNA aptamer to detect TDP-43 aggregation and used single molecule ISH to sensitively reveal TDP-43 loss-of-function, applying these methods in a deeply-phenotyped human post-mortem tissue cohort. We show that nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early event, that coincides with STMN-2 cryptic splicing. Crucially, we show that these pathological features of TDP-43 loss-of-function precede the clinical inflection point and are not required for region specific clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gain-of-function, but not loss-of-function, is the primary molecular correlate of clinical manifestation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate implications for early diagnostics and intervention prior to symptom onset in ALS.
