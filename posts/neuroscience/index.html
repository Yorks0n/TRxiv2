L.; Hale, S.; Aronov, D.\nScore: 226.7, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.27.542597\nEpisodic memory, or memory of experienced events, is a critical function of the hippocampus1-3. It is therefore important to understand how hippocampal activity represents specific events in an animals life. We addressed this question in chickadees - specialist food-caching birds that hide food at scattered locations and use memory to find their caches later in time4, 5. We performed high-density neural recordings in the hippocampus of chickadees as they cached and retrieved seeds in a laboratory arena. We found that each caching event was represented by a burst of firing in a unique set of hippocampal neurons. These barcode-like patterns of activity were sparse (\u003c10% of neurons active), uncorrelated even for immediately adjacent caches, and different even for separate caches at the same location. The barcode representing a specific caching event was transiently reactivated whenever a bird later interacted with the same cache - for example, to retrieve food. Barcodes co-occurred with conventional place cell activity6, 7, as well as location-independent responses to cached seeds. We propose that barcodes are signatures of episodic memories evoked during memory recall. These patterns assign a unique identifier to each event and may be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.\nA Versatile and Open Source One- and Two-Photon Light-Sheet Microscope Design\nAuthors: Panier, T.; Migault, G.; Hubert, A.; Trentesaux, H.; Beaudou, B.; Debregeas, G.; Bormuth, V.\nScore: 57.1, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548107\nTwo-photon light sheet microscopy offers great potential for a range of biological applications, but its practical implementation is impeded by the high cost of laser sources, the complexity of construction, and the challenges associated with adapting to existing microscope setups. Here, we release an open-source design that addresses these limitations by providing detailed building instructions for the transformation of a brightfield microscope into a versatile one- and two-photon light sheet system. Our design incorporates a specially designed broadband hollow core fiber, enabling the simultaneous utilization of an expansive pulsed laser source from another setup alongside a visible laser. This integration allows for uncompromised image resolution and speed. Furthermore, the design reduces the complexity of construction, alignment, and overall cost, thereby significantly enhancing the accessibility of this technology (https://github.com/LJPZebra/OLU).\nCompetition between stochastic neuropeptide signals calibrates the rate of satiation\nAuthors: Zhang, S. X.; Kim, A.; Madara, J. C.; Zhu, P. K.; Christenson, L. F.; Lutas, A.; Kalugin, P. N.; Jin, Y.; Paul, A.; Tian, L.; Lowell, B. B.; Andermann, M. L.\nScore: 54.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548551\nWe investigated how transmission of hunger- and satiety-promoting neuropeptides, NPY and MSH, is integrated at the level of intracellular signaling to control feeding. Receptors for these peptides use the second messenger cAMP, but the messengers spatiotemporal dynamics and role in energy balance are controversial. We show that AgRP axon stimulation in the paraventricular hypothalamus evokes probabilistic and spatially restricted NPY release that triggers stochastic cAMP decrements in downstream MC4R-expressing neurons (PVHMC4R). Meanwhile, POMC axon stimulation triggers stochastic, MSH-dependent cAMP increments. NPY and MSH competitively control cAMP, as reflected by hunger-state-dependent differences in the amplitude and persistence of cAMP transients evoked by each peptide. During feeding bouts, elevated MSH release and suppressed NPY release cooperatively sustain elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, thereby potentiating feeding-related excitatory inputs and promoting satiation across minutes. Our findings highlight how state-dependent integration of opposing, quantal peptidergic events by a common biochemical target calibrates energy intake.\nCooperative thalamocortical circuit mechanism for sensory prediction errors\nAuthors: Furutachi, S.; Franklin, A. D.; Mrsic-Flogel, T. D.; Hofer, S. B.\nScore: 53.3, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548664\nThe brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1-10. Despite the importance of prediction error signals for various neural computations across multiple brain regions, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit required for generating sensory prediction errors in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Using calcium imaging with optogenetic manipulations as mice traverse a familiar virtual environment, we show that violation of animals predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of layer 2/3 V1 neurons most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing a non-specific surprise or difference signal about how the visual input deviates from animals predictions. Selective amplification of unexpected visual input is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar, and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response-amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits.\nPredictions and errors are distinctly represented across V1 layers\nAuthors: Thomas, E. R.; Haarsma, J.; Nicholson, J.; Yon, D.; Kok, P.; Press, C.\nScore: 47.3, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548408\nPredictive processing frameworks of cortical functioning propose that neural populations in different cortical layers serve distinct roles in representing the world. There are distinct testable theories within this framework that we examined with a 7T fMRI study, where we contrasted responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to expected (75% likely) and unexpected (25%) Gabor orientations. Multivariate decoding analyses revealed an interaction between expectation and layer, such that expected events could be decoded with comparable accuracy across layers, while unexpected events could only be decoded in superficial laminae. These results are in line with predictive processing accounts where expected virtual input is injected into deep layers, while superficial layers process the error with respect to expected signals. While this account of cortical processing has been popular for decades, such distinctions have not previously been demonstrated in the human sensory brain. We discuss how both prediction and error processes may operate together to shape our unitary perceptual experiences.\nSustaining wakefulness: Brainstem connectivity in human consciousness\nAuthors: Edlow, B.

T.; Destrieux, C.; van der Kouwe, A.; Brown, E. N.; Folkerth, R. D.; Fischl, B.; Kinney, H. C.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548265\nConsciousness is comprised of arousal (i.e., wakefulness) and awareness. Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 micron resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness.\nOscillatory waveform shape and temporal spike correlations differ across bat frontal and auditory cortex\nAuthors: Garcia-Rosales, F.; Schaworonkow, N.; Hechavarria, J. C.\nScore: 40.7, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547519\nNeural oscillations are associated with diverse computations in the mammalian brain. The waveform shape of oscillatory activity measured in cortex relates to local physiology, and can be informative about aberrant or dynamically changing states. However, how waveform shape differs across distant yet functionally and anatomically related cortical regions is largely unknown. In this study, we capitalize on simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the auditory and frontal cortices of awake Carollia perspicillata bats to examine, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, waveform shape differences across cortical regions. We find that waveform shape differs markedly in the fronto-auditory circuit even for rhythmic activity in comparable frequency ranges (i.e. in the delta and gamma bands) during spontaneous activity. In addition, we report consistent differences between areas in the variability of waveform shape across individual cycles. A conceptual model predicts higher spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations in regions with more asymmetric shape, a phenomenon that was observed in the data: spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations were higher in frontal cortex. The model suggests a relationship between waveform shape differences and differences in spike correlations across cortical areas. Altogether, these results indicate that oscillatory activity in frontal and auditory possess distinct dynamics related to the anatomical and functional diversity of the fronto-auditory circuit. Significance statementThe brain activity of many animals displays intricate oscillations, which are usually characterized in terms of their frequency and amplitude. Here, we study oscillations from the bat frontal and auditory cortices on a cycle-by-cycle basis, additionally focusing on their characteristic waveform shape. The study reveals clear differences across regions in waveform shape and oscillatory regularity, even when the frequency of the oscillations is similar. A conceptual model predicts that more asymmetric waveforms result from stronger correlations between neural spikes and electrical field activity. Such predictions were supported by the data. The findings shed light onto the unique properties of different cortical areas, providing key insights into the distinctive physiology and functional diversity within the fronto-auditory circuit.\nNeural signatures of natural behavior in socializing macaques\nAuthors: Testard, C.; Tremblay, S.; Parodi, F.; DiTullio, R. W.; Acevedo-Ithier, A.; Gardiner, K.; Kording, K. P.; Platt, M.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547833\nOur understanding of the neurobiology of primate behavior largely derives from artificial tasks in highly-controlled laboratory settings, overlooking most natural behaviors primate brains evolved to produce1. In particular, how primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life2 and shape survival and reproductive success3 remains largely unexplored at the single neuron level. Here, we combine ethological analysis with new wireless recording technologies to uncover neural signatures of natural behavior in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques within a larger colony. Population decoding of single neuron activity in prefrontal and temporal cortex unveiled robust encoding of 24 species-typical behaviors, which was strongly modulated by the presence and identity of surrounding monkeys. Male-female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioral mechanism supporting friendships and alliances2, and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. When confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioral and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. Surprisingly, neural signatures in prefrontal and temporal cortex were largely indistinguishable and irreducible to visual and motor contingencies. By employing an ethological approach to the study of primate neurobiology, we reveal a highly-distributed neurophysiological record of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own.\nTutorial on MUedit: An open-source software for identifying and analysing the discharge timing of motor units from electromyographic signals\nAuthors: Avrillon, S.; Hug, F.; Gibbs, C.; Farina, D.\nScore: 30.4, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548568\nWe introduce the open-source software MUedit and we describe its use for identifying the discharge timing of motor units from all types of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded with multi-channel systems. MUedit performs EMG decomposition using a blind-source separation approach. Following this, users can display the estimated motor unit pulse trains and inspect the accuracy of the automatic detection of discharge times. When necessary, users can correct the automatic detection of discharge times and recalculate the motor unit pulse train with an updated separation vector. Here, we provide an open-source software and a tutorial that guides the user through i) the parameters and steps of the decomposition algorithm, and ii) the manual editing of motor unit pulse trains. Further, we provide simulated and experimental EMG signals recorded with grids of surface electrodes and intramuscular electrode arrays to benchmark the performance of MUedit. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of the blind-source separation approach for the study of motor unit behaviour during muscle contractions in humans.\nA Biophysical Model of Visual Rivalry Links Cellular Mechanisms to Signatures of Conscious Perception\nAuthors: Whyte, C. J.; Munn, B. R.; Aru, J.; Larkum, M.; John, Y.; Muller, E. J.; Shine, J. M.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548934\nInvestigations into the neural basis of conscious perception span multiple scales and levels of analysis. There is, however, a theoretical and methodological gap between advances made at the microscopic scale in animal models and those made at the macroscopic scale in human cognitive neuroscience that places a fundamental limit on our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Here, we use computational modelling to bridge this gap. Specifically, we show that the same mechanism that underlies threshold detection in mice - apical dendrite mediated burst firing in thick-tufted layer V pyramidal neurons - determines perceptual dominance in a thalamocortical model of binocular rivalry - a staple task in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. The model conforms to the constraints imposed by decades of previous research into binocular rivalry and generalises to the more sophisticated rivalry tasks studied in humans generating novel, testable, explanations of the role of expectation and attention in rivalry. Our model, therefore, provides an empirically-tractable bridge between cellular-level mechanisms and conscious perception.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Episodic memory, or memory of experienced events, is a critical function of the hippocampus1-3. It is therefore important to understand how hippocampal activity represents specific events in an animals life. We addressed this question in chickadees - specialist food-caching birds that hide food at scattered locations and use memory to find their caches later in time4, 5. We performed high-density neural recordings in the hippocampus of chickadees as they cached and retrieved seeds in a laboratory arena. We found that each caching event was represented by a burst of firing in a unique set of hippocampal neurons. These  barcode-like patterns of activity were sparse (&lt;10% of neurons active), uncorrelated even for immediately adjacent caches, and different even for separate caches at the same location. The barcode representing a specific caching event was transiently reactivated whenever a bird later interacted with the same cache - for example, to retrieve food. Barcodes co-occurred with conventional place cell activity6, 7, as well as location-independent responses to cached seeds. We propose that barcodes are signatures of episodic memories evoked during memory recall. These patterns assign a unique identifier to each event and may be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Two-photon light sheet microscopy offers great potential for a range of biological applications, but its practical implementation is impeded by the high cost of laser sources, the complexity of construction, and the challenges associated with adapting to existing microscope setups. Here, we release an open-source design that addresses these limitations by providing detailed building instructions for the transformation of a brightfield microscope into a versatile one- and two-photon light sheet system. Our design incorporates a specially designed broadband hollow core fiber, enabling the simultaneous utilization of an expansive pulsed laser source from another setup alongside a visible laser. This integration allows for uncompromised image resolution and speed. Furthermore, the design reduces the complexity of construction, alignment, and overall cost, thereby significantly enhancing the accessibility of this technology (https://github.com/LJPZebra/OLU).</p>

        <p class="abstract">We investigated how transmission of hunger- and satiety-promoting neuropeptides, NPY and MSH, is integrated at the level of intracellular signaling to control feeding. Receptors for these peptides use the second messenger cAMP, but the messengers spatiotemporal dynamics and role in energy balance are controversial. We show that AgRP axon stimulation in the paraventricular hypothalamus evokes probabilistic and spatially restricted NPY release that triggers stochastic cAMP decrements in downstream MC4R-expressing neurons (PVHMC4R). Meanwhile, POMC axon stimulation triggers stochastic, MSH-dependent cAMP increments. NPY and MSH competitively control cAMP, as reflected by hunger-state-dependent differences in the amplitude and persistence of cAMP transients evoked by each peptide. During feeding bouts, elevated MSH release and suppressed NPY release cooperatively sustain elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, thereby potentiating feeding-related excitatory inputs and promoting satiation across minutes. Our findings highlight how state-dependent integration of opposing, quantal peptidergic events by a common biochemical target calibrates energy intake.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1-10. Despite the importance of prediction error signals for various neural computations across multiple brain regions, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit required for generating sensory prediction errors in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Using calcium imaging with optogenetic manipulations as mice traverse a familiar virtual environment, we show that violation of animals predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of layer 2/3 V1 neurons most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing a non-specific surprise or difference signal about how the visual input deviates from animals predictions. Selective amplification of unexpected visual input is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar, and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response-amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predictive processing frameworks of cortical functioning propose that neural populations in different cortical layers serve distinct roles in representing the world. There are distinct testable theories within this framework that we examined with a 7T fMRI study, where we contrasted responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to expected (75% likely) and unexpected (25%) Gabor orientations. Multivariate decoding analyses revealed an interaction between expectation and layer, such that expected events could be decoded with comparable accuracy across layers, while unexpected events could only be decoded in superficial laminae. These results are in line with predictive processing accounts where expected virtual input is injected into deep layers, while superficial layers process the  error with respect to expected signals. While this account of cortical processing has been popular for decades, such distinctions have not previously been demonstrated in the human sensory brain. We discuss how both prediction and error processes may operate together to shape our unitary perceptual experiences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Consciousness is comprised of arousal (i.e., wakefulness) and awareness. Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 micron resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural oscillations are associated with diverse computations in the mammalian brain. The waveform shape of oscillatory activity measured in cortex relates to local physiology, and can be informative about aberrant or dynamically changing states. However, how waveform shape differs across distant yet functionally and anatomically related cortical regions is largely unknown. In this study, we capitalize on simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the auditory and frontal cortices of awake Carollia perspicillata bats to examine, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, waveform shape differences across cortical regions. We find that waveform shape differs markedly in the fronto-auditory circuit even for rhythmic activity in comparable frequency ranges (i.e. in the delta and gamma bands) during spontaneous activity. In addition, we report consistent differences between areas in the variability of waveform shape across individual cycles. A conceptual model predicts higher spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations in regions with more asymmetric shape, a phenomenon that was observed in the data: spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations were higher in frontal cortex. The model suggests a relationship between waveform shape differences and differences in spike correlations across cortical areas. Altogether, these results indicate that oscillatory activity in frontal and auditory possess distinct dynamics related to the anatomical and functional diversity of the fronto-auditory circuit.

Significance statementThe brain activity of many animals displays intricate oscillations, which are usually characterized in terms of their frequency and amplitude. Here, we study oscillations from the bat frontal and auditory cortices on a cycle-by-cycle basis, additionally focusing on their characteristic waveform shape. The study reveals clear differences across regions in waveform shape and oscillatory regularity, even when the frequency of the oscillations is similar. A conceptual model predicts that more asymmetric waveforms result from stronger correlations between neural spikes and electrical field activity. Such predictions were supported by the data. The findings shed light onto the unique properties of different cortical areas, providing key insights into the distinctive physiology and functional diversity within the fronto-auditory circuit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our understanding of the neurobiology of primate behavior largely derives from artificial tasks in highly-controlled laboratory settings, overlooking most natural behaviors primate brains evolved to produce1. In particular, how primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life2 and shape survival and reproductive success3 remains largely unexplored at the single neuron level. Here, we combine ethological analysis with new wireless recording technologies to uncover neural signatures of natural behavior in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques within a larger colony. Population decoding of single neuron activity in prefrontal and temporal cortex unveiled robust encoding of 24 species-typical behaviors, which was strongly modulated by the presence and identity of surrounding monkeys. Male-female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioral mechanism supporting friendships and alliances2, and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. When confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioral and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. Surprisingly, neural signatures in prefrontal and temporal cortex were largely indistinguishable and irreducible to visual and motor contingencies. By employing an ethological approach to the study of primate neurobiology, we reveal a highly-distributed neurophysiological record of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce the open-source software MUedit and we describe its use for identifying the discharge timing of motor units from all types of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded with multi-channel systems. MUedit performs EMG decomposition using a blind-source separation approach. Following this, users can display the estimated motor unit pulse trains and inspect the accuracy of the automatic detection of discharge times. When necessary, users can correct the automatic detection of discharge times and recalculate the motor unit pulse train with an updated separation vector. Here, we provide an open-source software and a tutorial that guides the user through i) the parameters and steps of the decomposition algorithm, and ii) the manual editing of motor unit pulse trains. Further, we provide simulated and experimental EMG signals recorded with grids of surface electrodes and intramuscular electrode arrays to benchmark the performance of MUedit. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of the blind-source separation approach for the study of motor unit behaviour during muscle contractions in humans.</p>

There is, however, a theoretical and methodological gap between advances made at the microscopic scale in animal models and those made at the macroscopic scale in human cognitive neuroscience that places a fundamental limit on our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Here, we use computational modelling to bridge this gap. Specifically, we show that the same mechanism that underlies threshold detection in mice - apical dendrite mediated burst firing in thick-tufted layer V pyramidal neurons - determines perceptual dominance in a thalamocortical model of binocular rivalry - a staple task in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. The model conforms to the constraints imposed by decades of previous research into binocular rivalry and generalises to the more sophisticated rivalry tasks studied in humans generating novel, testable, explanations of the role of expectation and attention in rivalry. Our model, therefore, provides an empirically-tractable bridge between cellular-level mechanisms and conscious perception.</p>
