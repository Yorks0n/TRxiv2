Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate neuroinflammation is currently unknown. Using a multiomics approach, we identified a new molecular signature that perpetuates the activation of myeloid cells through mitochondrial complex II (CII) and I (CI) activity driving reverse electron transport (RET) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking RET in pro-inflammatory myeloid cells protected the central nervous system (CNS) against neurotoxic damage and improved functional outcomes in animal disease models in vivo. Our data show that RET in myeloid cells is a potential new therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in smouldering inflammatory CNS disorders3.\nThe brainstem's red nucleus was evolutionarily upgraded to support goal-directed action\nAuthors: Krimmel, S. R.; Laumann, T. O.; Chauvin, R.; Hershey, T.; Roland, J. L.; Shimony, J. S.; Willie, J. T.; Norris, S. A.; Marek, S.; Van, A. N.; Monk, J.; Scheidter, K.

F.\nScore: 51.4, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573730\nThe red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N [~] 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity. Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a motor structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.\nA choroid plexus apocrine secretion mechanism shapes CSF proteome and embryonic brain development\nAuthors: Courtney, Y.; Head, J. P.; Yimer, E. D.; Dani, N.; Shipley, F. B.; Libermann, T. A.; Lehtinen, M. K.\nScore: 37.5, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574486\nWe discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brains ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.\nThe Neuron as a Direct Data-Driven Controller\nAuthors: Moore, J.; Genkin, A.; Tournoy, M.; Pughe-Sanford, J.; de Ruyter van Steveninck, R. R.; Chklovskii, D. B.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573843\nIn the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a promising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal physiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons, especially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their environment towards a specific desired state through their output. This environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control (DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control. Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the brain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional, feedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a novel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural networks.\nPrinciples of visual cortex excitatory microcircuit organization\nAuthors: Chou, C. Y. C.; Wong, H. H.-W.; Guo, C.; Boukoulou, K. E.; Huang, C.; Jannat, J.; Klimenko, T.; Li, V. Y.; Liang, T. A.; Wu, V. C.; Sjöström, P. J.\nScore: 31.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573666\nMicrocircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

S.; Zheng, Q.; Meng, M.; Matias, S.; Drugowitsch, J.; Uchida, N.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573966\nMachine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards -- an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2,3, but little is known about whether, where, and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions4. To fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to acutely record striatal activity from well-trained, water-restricted mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance, and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Remarkably, chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons -- D1 and D2 MSNs -- contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 MSNs5-15 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.\nA developmental brain-wide screen identifies retrosplenial cortex as a key player in the emergence of persistent memory\nAuthors: Jin, B.; Gongwer, M. W.; Ohanian, L.; Holden-Wingate, L.; Le, B.; Darmawan, A.; Nakayama, Y.; Mora, S. A. R.; DeNardo, L. A.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574554\nMemories formed early in life are short-lived while those formed later persist. Recent work revealed that infant memories are stored in a latent state. But why they fail to be retrieved is poorly understood. Here we investigated brain-wide circuit mechanisms underlying infantile amnesia in mice. We performed a screen that combined activity-dependent neuronal tagging at different postnatal ages, tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy. We observed striking developmental transitions in the organization of fear memory networks and changes in the activity and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) that aligned with the emergence of persistent memory. 7 days after learning, chemogenetic reactivation of tagged RSP ensembles enhanced memory in adults but not in infants. But after 33 days, reactivating infant-tagged RSP ensembles recovered forgotten memories. These studies show that RSP ensembles store latent infant memories, reveal the time course of RSP functional maturation, and suggest that immature RSP functional networks contribute to infantile amnesia.\nGrid cells perform path integration in multiple reference frames during self-motion-based navigation\nAuthors: Peng, J.-J.; Throm, B.; Najafian Jazi, M.; Yen, T.-Y.; Monyer, H.; Allen, K.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572857\nWith their periodic firing pattern, grid cells are considered a fundamental unit of a neural network performing path integration. The periodic firing patterns of grid cells have been observed mainly during behaviors with little navigational demands, and the firing patterns of grid cells in animals navigating 2D environments using path integration are largely unknown. Here, we recorded the activity of grid cells in mice performing the AutoPI task, a task assessing homing based on path integration. Using artificial deep neural networks to decode the animals moment-to-moment movement vectors, we found that grid cells perform path integration over short trajectories and change their reference frames within single trials. More specifically, grid cell modules re-anchor to a task-relevant object via a translation of the grid pattern. The code for movement direction in grid modules drifts as the animal navigates using self-motion cues, and this drift predicts the homing direction of the mouse. These results reveal the computations in grid cell circuits during self-motion-based navigation.\nBehavioral screening of conserved RNA-binding proteins reveals CEY-1/YBX RNA-binding protein dysfunction leads to impairments in memory and cognition\nAuthors: Hayden, A. N.; Brandel, K. L.; Merlau, P. R.; Vijayakumar, P.; Leptich, E. J.; Pietryk, E. W.; Gaytan, E. S.; Ni, C. W.; Chao, H.-T.; Rosenfeld, J. A.; Arey, R. N.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574402\nRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of translation and plasticity in the nervous system, which are processes required for learning and memory. Indeed, RBP dysfunction has been linked to a wide range of neurological disorders where cognitive impairments are a key symptom. However, the human genome encodes nearly 2,000 RBPs, many of which have yet to be characterized with regards to neurological phenotypes like associative behaviors. To address this, we used the model organism C. elegans to perform a targeted screen assessing the role of 20 conserved RBPs in learning and memory. We identified 16 associative memory regulators, eight of which are novel. Intriguingly, three novel memory regulators are in the C. elegans Y-Box (CEY) RNA-binding protein family: cey-1, cey-2, and cey-3. We determined that cey-1 is the closest ortholog to the mammalian Y-Box RNA-binding (YBX) proteins and that CEY-1 is specifically required in the nervous system for the ability to remember. Additionally, CEY-1 is a memory promoting molecule, as increasing CEY-1 only in the nervous system improves memory. We also examined human copy number variation datasets and found that copy number deletions in the human YBX1 and YBX3 may be associated with neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, which mirror our findings in C. elegans. We identified a similar association with a rare, mono-allelic YBX3 variant in individuals with neurological findings. Strikingly, introducing this predicted deleterious YBX3 variant into the endogenous cey-1 locus caused memory deficits in the worm. Our study highlights that high-throughput approaches in the worm reveal novel and conserved regulators of memory and identified a potential new source of rare neurological disease linked to RBP dysfunction.\nPsilocybin Promotes Cell-Type-Specific Changes in the Orbitofrontal Cortex Revealed by Single-Nucleus RNA-seq\nAuthors: Huang, Z.; Wei, X.; Wang, Y.; Tian, J.; Dong, J.; Liang, B.; Lu, L.; Zhang, W.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.573163\nRecent clinical breakthroughs hold great promise for the application of psilocybin in the treatments of psychological disorders, such as depression, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psilocybin is a psychedelic whose metabolite, psilocin, is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of psilocybin on the brain are not fully illustrated, and cell type-specific and circuit effects of psilocybin are not fully understood. Here, we combined single-nucleus RNA-seq with functional assays to study the long-term effects of psilocybin on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region vulnerable to psychological disorders such as depression. We showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced long-term genetic and functional changes in neurons of the OFC, and excitatory and inhibitory neurons collectively reduced circuit activity of the brain region. Knockdown of 5-HT2A receptor in deep layer excitatory neurons abated psilocybin-induced functional changes and the anti-depressant effect. Together, these results showed the cell type-specific mechanisms of psilocybin and shed light on the brain region difference in the effect of psychedelics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Sustained smouldering, or low grade, activation of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS)1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate neuroinflammation is currently unknown. Using a multiomics approach, we identified a new molecular signature that perpetuates the activation of myeloid cells through mitochondrial complex II (CII) and I (CI) activity driving reverse electron transport (RET) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking RET in pro-inflammatory myeloid cells protected the central nervous system (CNS) against neurotoxic damage and improved functional outcomes in animal disease models in vivo. Our data show that RET in myeloid cells is a potential new therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in smouldering inflammatory CNS disorders3.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N [~] 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity.

Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a  motor structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We discovered that apocrine secretion by embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells contributes to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and influences brain development in mice. The apocrine response relies on sustained intracellular calcium signaling and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. It rapidly alters the embryonic CSF proteome, activating neural progenitors lining the brains ventricles. Supraphysiological apocrine secretion induced during mouse development by maternal administration of a serotonergic 5HT2C receptor agonist dysregulates offspring cerebral cortical development, alters the fate of CSF-contacting neural progenitors, and ultimately changes adult social behaviors. Critically, exposure to maternal illness or to the psychedelic drug LSD during pregnancy also overactivates the ChP, inducing excessive secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which maternal exposure to diverse stressors disrupts in utero brain development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a promising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal physiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons, especially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their environment towards a specific desired state through their output. This environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control (DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control. Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the brain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional, feedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a novel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microcircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards -- an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2,3, but little is known about whether, where, and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions4. To fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to acutely record striatal activity from well-trained, water-restricted mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance, and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Remarkably, chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons -- D1 and D2 MSNs -- contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 MSNs5-15 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memories formed early in life are short-lived while those formed later persist. Recent work revealed that infant memories are stored in a latent state. But why they fail to be retrieved is poorly understood. Here we investigated brain-wide circuit mechanisms underlying infantile amnesia in mice. We performed a screen that combined activity-dependent neuronal tagging at different postnatal ages, tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy. We observed striking developmental transitions in the organization of fear memory networks and changes in the activity and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) that aligned with the emergence of persistent memory. 7 days after learning, chemogenetic reactivation of tagged RSP ensembles enhanced memory in adults but not in infants. But after 33 days, reactivating infant-tagged RSP ensembles recovered forgotten memories. These studies show that RSP ensembles store latent infant memories, reveal the time course of RSP functional maturation, and suggest that immature RSP functional networks contribute to infantile amnesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With their periodic firing pattern, grid cells are considered a fundamental unit of a neural network performing path integration. The periodic firing patterns of grid cells have been observed mainly during behaviors with little navigational demands, and the firing patterns of grid cells in animals navigating 2D environments using path integration are largely unknown. Here, we recorded the activity of grid cells in mice performing the AutoPI task, a task assessing homing based on path integration. Using artificial deep neural networks to decode the animals moment-to-moment movement vectors, we found that grid cells perform path integration over short trajectories and change their reference frames within single trials. More specifically, grid cell modules re-anchor to a task-relevant object via a translation of the grid pattern. The code for movement direction in grid modules drifts as the animal navigates using self-motion cues, and this drift predicts the homing direction of the mouse. These results reveal the computations in grid cell circuits during self-motion-based navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of translation and plasticity in the nervous system, which are processes required for learning and memory. Indeed, RBP dysfunction has been linked to a wide range of neurological disorders where cognitive impairments are a key symptom. However, the human genome encodes nearly 2,000 RBPs, many of which have yet to be characterized with regards to neurological phenotypes like associative behaviors. To address this, we used the model organism C. elegans to perform a targeted screen assessing the role of 20 conserved RBPs in learning and memory. We identified 16 associative memory regulators, eight of which are novel. Intriguingly, three novel memory regulators are in the C. elegans Y-Box (CEY) RNA-binding protein family: cey-1, cey-2, and cey-3. We determined that cey-1 is the closest ortholog to the mammalian Y-Box RNA-binding (YBX) proteins and that CEY-1 is specifically required in the nervous system for the ability to remember. Additionally, CEY-1 is a memory promoting molecule, as increasing CEY-1 only in the nervous system improves memory. We also examined human copy number variation datasets and found that copy number deletions in the human YBX1 and YBX3 may be associated with neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, which mirror our findings in C. elegans. We identified a similar association with a rare, mono-allelic YBX3 variant in individuals with neurological findings. Strikingly, introducing this predicted deleterious YBX3 variant into the endogenous cey-1 locus caused memory deficits in the worm. Our study highlights that high-throughput approaches in the worm reveal novel and conserved regulators of memory and identified a potential new source of rare neurological disease linked to RBP dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent clinical breakthroughs hold great promise for the application of psilocybin in the treatments of psychological disorders, such as depression, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psilocybin is a psychedelic whose metabolite, psilocin, is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of psilocybin on the brain are not fully illustrated, and cell type-specific and circuit effects of psilocybin are not fully understood. Here, we combined single-nucleus RNA-seq with functional assays to study the long-term effects of psilocybin on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region vulnerable to psychological disorders such as depression. We showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced long-term genetic and functional changes in neurons of the OFC, and excitatory and inhibitory neurons collectively reduced circuit activity of the brain region. Knockdown of 5-HT2A receptor in deep layer excitatory neurons abated psilocybin-induced functional changes and the anti-depressant effect. Together, these results showed the cell type-specific mechanisms of psilocybin and shed light on the brain region difference in the effect of psychedelics.</p>
