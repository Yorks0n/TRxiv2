Here we examined the mechanisms for biased value learning using reinforcement learning models incorporating recent findings on synaptic plasticity and opponent circuit mechanisms in the basal ganglia. We show that variations in tonic dopamine can alter the balance between learning from positive and negative reward prediction errors, leading to biased value predictions. This bias arises from the sigmoidal shapes of the dose-occupancy curves and distinct affinities of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors: changes in tonic dopamine differentially alters the slope of the dose-occupancy curves of these receptors, thus sensitivities, at baseline dopamine concentrations. We show that this mechanism can explain biased value learning in both mice and humans and may also contribute to symptoms observed in psychiatric disorders. Our model provides a foundation for understanding the basal ganglia circuit and underscores the significance of tonic dopamine in modulating learning processes.\nAberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves following synapsin-dependent adenoviral expression of Ca2+ indicators\nAuthors: Masala, N.; Mittag, M.; Ambrad Giovannetti, E.; O'Neil, D. A.; Distler, F. J.; Rupprecht, P.; Helmchen, F.; Yuste, R.; Fuhrmann, M.; Beck, H.; Wenzel, M.; Kelly, T.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566169\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adenoviral transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2+ micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer. Ca2+ micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI under the synapsin promoter. Further, neuronal subtype, and density of GECI expression may play a role. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used syn-Ca2+-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca2+ responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca2+ micro-waves and we provide a potential solution for this problem. Impact statement: Common adenoviral transduction procedures induce artefactual spatially confined Ca2+ waves in the hippocampus.\nGenetic, transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analysis of progressive supranuclear palsy implicates glial activation and novel risk genes\nAuthors: Farrell, K.; Humphrey, J.; Chang, T.; Zhao, Y.; Leung, Y.

H.;\nScore: 30.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.565552\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare Parkinsonian disorder characterized by problems with movement, balance, cognition, and other symptoms. PSP differs from Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases displaying abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (\"tauopathies\") by the presence of pathology not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences, however much of PSP genetics remains unexplained. Here we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP to date including 2,779 cases (2,595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5,584 controls and identified six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (p \u003c 5x10-8) associations including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations revealed a unique oligodendrocytic signature that distinguishes PSP from AD and Parkinsons disease. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identified oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, as well as an association with elevated C4A expression in bulk brain tissue which may be driven by increased C4A copy number in PSP cases. Finally, histological studies demonstrated abnormal tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies including epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identified potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in the pathogenesis of PSP.\nGeneral anaesthesia reduces the uniqueness of brain connectivity across individuals and across species\nAuthors: Luppi, A. I.; Golkowski, D.; Ranft, A.; Ilg, R.; Jordan, D.; Bzdok, D.; Owen, A. M. I.; Naci, L.; Stamatakis, E. A.; Amico, E. A.; Misic, B.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566332\nThe human brain is characterised by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain: both with respect to the brains of other individuals, and the brains of another species. We report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organised: it co-localises with the archetypal sensory-association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol, and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that under anaesthesia the functional connectivity of the human brain becomes more similar to the macaque brain. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and meta-analytic brain patterns aggregated from the NeuroSynth engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetised human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.\nCell lineage analysis with somatic mutations reveals late divergence of neuronal cell types and cortical areas in human cerebral cortex\nAuthors: Kim, S.

A.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565899\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex shows functional specialization into regions with distinct neuronal compositions, most strikingly in the human brain, but little is known in about how cellular lineages shape cortical regional variation and neuronal cell types during development. Here, we use somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) to map lineages of neuronal sub-types and cortical regions. Early-occurring sSNVs rarely respect Brodmann area (BA) borders, while late-occurring sSNVs mark neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction, though descendants often dispersed into neighboring BAs. Nevertheless, in visual cortex, BA17 contains 30-70% more sSNVs compared to the neighboring BA18, with clones across the BA17/18 border distributed asymmetrically and thus displaying different cortex-wide dispersion patterns. Moreover, we find that excitatory neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction consistently share low-mosaic sSNVs with some inhibitory neurons, suggesting significant co-generation of excitatory and some inhibitory neurons in the dorsal cortex. Our analysis reveals human-specific cortical cell lineage patterns, with both regional inhomogeneities in progenitor proliferation and late divergence of excitatory/inhibitory lineages.\nCriticality of resting-state EEG predicts perturbational complexity and level of consciousness during anesthesia\nAuthors: Maschke, C.; O'Byrne, J.; Colombo, M. A.; Boly, M.; Gosseries, O.; Laureys, S.; Rosanova, M.; Jerbi, K.; Blain-Moraes, S.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564247\n1Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigated dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. We then studied the relation of these dynamic properties with the perturbational complexity index (PCI), which has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independent of behavior. All participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams)., enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. We estimated (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related measures, and found that states of unconsciousness were characterized by a distancing from both the edge of activity propagation and the edge of chaos. We were then able to predict individual subjects PCI (i.e., PCImax) with a mean absolute error below 7%. Our results establish a firm link between the PCI and criticality and provide further evidence for the role of criticality in the emergence of consciousness. 2 Significance StatementComplexity has long been of interest in consciousness science and had a fundamental impact on many of todays theories of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) uses the complexity of the brains response to cortical perturbations to quantify the presence of consciousness. We propose criticality as a unifying framework underlying maximal complexity and sensitivity to perturbation in the conscious brain. We demonstrate that criticality measures derived from resting-state electroencephalography can distinguish conscious from unconscious states, using propofol, xenon and ketamine anesthesia, and from these measures we were able to predict the PCI with a mean error below 7%. Our results support the hypothesis that critical brain dynamics are implicated in the emergence of consciousness and may provide new directions for the assessment of consciousness.\nAberrant splicing exonizes C9ORF72 repeat expansion in ALS/FTD\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Wijegunawardana, D.; Sheth, U.; Veire, A.; Salgado, J. M. S.; Agrawal, M.; Zhou, J.; Pereira, J. D.; Gendron, T. F.; Guo, J. U.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566896\nA nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) in the first annotated intron of the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While C9 NRE-containing RNAs can be translated into several toxic dipeptide repeat proteins, how an intronic NRE can assess the translation machinery in the cytoplasm remains unclear. By capturing and sequencing NRE-containing RNAs from patient-derived cells, we found that C9 NRE was exonized by the usage of downstream 5' splice sites and exported from the nucleus in a variety of spliced mRNA isoforms. C9ORF72 aberrant splicing was substantially elevated in both C9 NRE+ motor neurons and human brain tissues. Furthermore, NREs above the pathological threshold were sufficient to activate cryptic splice sites in reporter mRNAs. In summary, our results revealed a crucial and potentially widespread role of repeat-induced aberrant splicing in the biogenesis, localization, and translation of NRE-containing RNAs.\nMultivariate links between the developmental timing of adversity exposure and white matter tract integrity in adulthood\nAuthors: Sisk, L. M.; Keding, T. J.; Cohodes, E. M.; McCauley, S.; Pierre, J. C.; Odriozola, P.; Kribakaran, S.; Haberman, J. T.; Zacharek, S. J.; Hodges, H. R.; Caballero, C.; Gold, G.; Huang, A. Y.; Talton, A.; Gee, D. G.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566271\nEarly-life adversity is pervasive worldwide and represents a potent risk factor for increased mental health burden across the lifespan. However, there is substantial individual heterogeneity in associations between adversity exposure, neurobiological changes, and mental health problems. Accounting for key features of adversity such as the developmental timing of exposure may clarify associations between adversity, neurodevelopment, and mental health. The present study leverages sparse canonical correlation analysis to characterize modes of covariation between age of adversity exposure and the integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain in a sample of 107 adults. We find that adversity exposure during middle childhood (ages 5-6 and 8-9 in particular) is consistently linked with alterations in white matter tract integrity, such that tracts supporting sensorimotor functions display higher integrity in relation to adversity exposure while tracts supporting cortico-cortical communication display lower integrity. Further, latent patterns of tract integrity linked with adversity experienced across preschool age and middle childhood (ages 4-9) were associated with trauma-related symptoms in adulthood. Our findings underscore that adversity exposure may differentially affect white matter in a function- and developmental-timing specific manner and suggest that adversity experienced between ages 4-9 may shape the development of global white matter tracts in ways that are relevant for adult mental health.\nFunctional brain networks are associated with both sex and gender in children\nAuthors: Dhamala, E.; Bassett, D.; Yeo, B. T. T.; Holmes, A.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566592\nSex and gender are associated with human behavior throughout the lifespan and across health and disease, but whether they are associated with similar or distinct neural phenotypes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in children, sex and gender are uniquely reflected in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain. Unimodal networks are more strongly associated with sex while heteromodal networks are more strongly associated with gender. These results suggest sex and gender are irreducible to one another not only in society but also in biology.\nSocial isolation recruits amygdala-cortical circuitry to escalate alcohol drinking\nAuthors: Patel, R.; Patarino, M.; Kim, K.; Pamintuan, R.; Taschbach, F.; Li, H.; Lee, C.; van Hoek, A.; Castro, R.; Cazares, C.; Miranda, R.; Jia, C.; Delahanty, J.; Batra, K.; Keyes, L.; Libster, A.; Wichmann, R. W.; Pereira, T.; Benna, M.; Tye, K. M.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566421\nHow do social factors impact the brain and contribute to increased alcohol drinking? We found that social rank predicts alcohol drinking, where subordinates drink more than dominants. Furthermore, social isolation escalates alcohol drinking, particularly impacting subordinates who display a greater increase in alcohol drinking compared to dominants. Using cellular resolution calcium imaging, we show that the basolateral amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (BLA-mPFC) circuit predicts alcohol drinking in a rank-dependent manner, unlike non-specific BLA activity. The BLA-mPFC circuit becomes hyperexcitable during social isolation, detecting social isolation states. Mimicking the observed increases in BLA-mPFC activity using optogenetics was sufficient to increase alcohol drinking, suggesting the BLA-mPFC circuit may be a neural substrate for the negative impact of social isolation. To test the hypothesis that the BLA-mPFC circuit conveys a signal induced by social isolation to motivate alcohol consumption, we first determined if this circuit detects social information. Leveraging optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging and SLEAP automated pose tracking, we found that BLA-mPFC circuitry governs social behavior and neural representation of social contact. We further show that BLA-mPFC stimulation mimics social isolation-induced mPFC encoding of sucrose and alcohol, and inhibition of the BLA-mPFC circuit decreases alcohol drinking following social isolation. Collectively, these data suggest the amygdala-cortical circuit mirrors a neural encoding state similar to social isolation and underlies social isolation-associated alcohol drinking.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of various psychiatric disorders is biased future predictions. Here we examined the mechanisms for biased value learning using reinforcement learning models incorporating recent findings on synaptic plasticity and opponent circuit mechanisms in the basal ganglia. We show that variations in tonic dopamine can alter the balance between learning from positive and negative reward prediction errors, leading to biased value predictions. This bias arises from the sigmoidal shapes of the dose-occupancy curves and distinct affinities of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors: changes in tonic dopamine differentially alters the slope of the dose-occupancy curves of these receptors, thus sensitivities, at baseline dopamine concentrations. We show that this mechanism can explain biased value learning in both mice and humans and may also contribute to symptoms observed in psychiatric disorders. Our model provides a foundation for understanding the basal ganglia circuit and underscores the significance of tonic dopamine in modulating learning processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adenoviral transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2&#43; micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer. Ca2&#43; micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2&#43; micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI under the synapsin promoter. Further, neuronal subtype, and density of GECI expression may play a role. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used syn-Ca2&#43;-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca2&#43; responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca2&#43; micro-waves and we provide a potential solution for this problem.

Impact statement: Common adenoviral transduction procedures induce artefactual spatially confined Ca2&#43; waves in the hippocampus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare Parkinsonian disorder characterized by problems with movement, balance, cognition, and other symptoms. PSP differs from Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases displaying abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (&#34;tauopathies&#34;) by the presence of pathology not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences, however much of PSP genetics remains unexplained. Here we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP to date including 2,779 cases (2,595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5,584 controls and identified six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (p &lt; 5x10-8) associations including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations revealed a unique oligodendrocytic signature that distinguishes PSP from AD and Parkinsons disease. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identified oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, as well as an association with elevated C4A expression in bulk brain tissue which may be driven by increased C4A copy number in PSP cases. Finally, histological studies demonstrated abnormal tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies including epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identified potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in the pathogenesis of PSP.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human brain is characterised by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain: both with respect to the brains of other individuals, and the brains of another species. We report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organised: it co-localises with the archetypal sensory-association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol, and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that under anaesthesia the functional connectivity of the human brain becomes more similar to the macaque brain. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and meta-analytic brain patterns aggregated from the NeuroSynth engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetised human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian cerebral cortex shows functional specialization into regions with distinct neuronal compositions, most strikingly in the human brain, but little is known in about how cellular lineages shape cortical regional variation and neuronal cell types during development. Here, we use somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) to map lineages of neuronal sub-types and cortical regions. Early-occurring sSNVs rarely respect Brodmann area (BA) borders, while late-occurring sSNVs mark neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction, though descendants often dispersed into neighboring BAs. Nevertheless, in visual cortex, BA17 contains 30-70% more sSNVs compared to the neighboring BA18, with clones across the BA17/18 border distributed asymmetrically and thus displaying different cortex-wide dispersion patterns. Moreover, we find that excitatory neuron-generating clones with modest regional restriction consistently share low-mosaic sSNVs with some inhibitory neurons, suggesting significant co-generation of excitatory and some inhibitory neurons in the dorsal cortex. Our analysis reveals human-specific cortical cell lineage patterns, with both regional inhomogeneities in progenitor proliferation and late divergence of excitatory/inhibitory lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigated dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. We then studied the relation of these dynamic properties with the perturbational complexity index (PCI), which has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independent of behavior. All participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams)., enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. We estimated (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related measures, and found that states of unconsciousness were characterized by a distancing from both the edge of activity propagation and the edge of chaos. We were then able to predict individual subjects PCI (i.e., PCImax) with a mean absolute error below 7%. Our results establish a firm link between the PCI and criticality and provide further evidence for the role of criticality in the emergence of consciousness.

2 Significance StatementComplexity has long been of interest in consciousness science and had a fundamental impact on many of todays theories of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) uses the complexity of the brains response to cortical perturbations to quantify the presence of consciousness. We propose criticality as a unifying framework underlying maximal complexity and sensitivity to perturbation in the conscious brain. We demonstrate that criticality measures derived from resting-state electroencephalography can distinguish conscious from unconscious states, using propofol, xenon and ketamine anesthesia, and from these measures we were able to predict the PCI with a mean error below 7%. Our results support the hypothesis that critical brain dynamics are implicated in the emergence of consciousness and may provide new directions for the assessment of consciousness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) in the first annotated intron of the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While C9 NRE-containing RNAs can be translated into several toxic dipeptide repeat proteins, how an intronic NRE can assess the translation machinery in the cytoplasm remains unclear. By capturing and sequencing NRE-containing RNAs from patient-derived cells, we found that C9 NRE was exonized by the usage of downstream 5&#39; splice sites and exported from the nucleus in a variety of spliced mRNA isoforms. C9ORF72 aberrant splicing was substantially elevated in both C9 NRE&#43; motor neurons and human brain tissues. Furthermore, NREs above the pathological threshold were sufficient to activate cryptic splice sites in reporter mRNAs. In summary, our results revealed a crucial and potentially widespread role of repeat-induced aberrant splicing in the biogenesis, localization, and translation of NRE-containing RNAs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life adversity is pervasive worldwide and represents a potent risk factor for increased mental health burden across the lifespan. However, there is substantial individual heterogeneity in associations between adversity exposure, neurobiological changes, and mental health problems. Accounting for key features of adversity such as the developmental timing of exposure may clarify associations between adversity, neurodevelopment, and mental health. The present study leverages sparse canonical correlation analysis to characterize modes of covariation between age of adversity exposure and the integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain in a sample of 107 adults. We find that adversity exposure during middle childhood (ages 5-6 and 8-9 in particular) is consistently linked with alterations in white matter tract integrity, such that tracts supporting sensorimotor functions display higher integrity in relation to adversity exposure while tracts supporting cortico-cortical communication display lower integrity. Further, latent patterns of tract integrity linked with adversity experienced across preschool age and middle childhood (ages 4-9) were associated with trauma-related symptoms in adulthood. Our findings underscore that adversity exposure may differentially affect white matter in a function- and developmental-timing specific manner and suggest that adversity experienced between ages 4-9 may shape the development of global white matter tracts in ways that are relevant for adult mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex and gender are associated with human behavior throughout the lifespan and across health and disease, but whether they are associated with similar or distinct neural phenotypes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in children, sex and gender are uniquely reflected in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain. Unimodal networks are more strongly associated with sex while heteromodal networks are more strongly associated with gender. These results suggest sex and gender are irreducible to one another not only in society but also in biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How do social factors impact the brain and contribute to increased alcohol drinking? We found that social rank predicts alcohol drinking, where subordinates drink more than dominants. Furthermore, social isolation escalates alcohol drinking, particularly impacting subordinates who display a greater increase in alcohol drinking compared to dominants. Using cellular resolution calcium imaging, we show that the basolateral amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (BLA-mPFC) circuit predicts alcohol drinking in a rank-dependent manner, unlike non-specific BLA activity. The BLA-mPFC circuit becomes hyperexcitable during social isolation, detecting social isolation states. Mimicking the observed increases in BLA-mPFC activity using optogenetics was sufficient to increase alcohol drinking, suggesting the BLA-mPFC circuit may be a neural substrate for the negative impact of social isolation. To test the hypothesis that the BLA-mPFC circuit conveys a signal induced by social isolation to motivate alcohol consumption, we first determined if this circuit detects social information. Leveraging optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging and SLEAP automated pose tracking, we found that BLA-mPFC circuitry governs social behavior and neural representation of social contact. We further show that BLA-mPFC stimulation mimics social isolation-induced mPFC encoding of sucrose and alcohol, and inhibition of the BLA-mPFC circuit decreases alcohol drinking following social isolation. Collectively, these data suggest the amygdala-cortical circuit mirrors a neural encoding state similar to social isolation and underlies social isolation-associated alcohol drinking.</p>
