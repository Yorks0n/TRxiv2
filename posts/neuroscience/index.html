M.; Schaper, F. L.; Siddiqi, S. H.; Anderson, J. S.; Nielsen, J. A.; Bateman, J. R.; Grafman, J.; Fox, M. D.\nScore: 170.8, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572527\nReligious fundamentalism, characterized by rigid adherence to a set of beliefs putatively revealing inerrant truths, is ubiquitous across cultures and has a global impact on society. Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobes. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets (r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-induced conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with hemispheric specializations in reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.\nComment on 'Accumbens cholinergic interneurons dynamically promote dopamine release and enable motivation'\nAuthors: Taniguchi, J.; Melani, R.; Chantranupong, L.; Wen, M. J.; Mohebi, A.; Berke, J. D.; Sabatini, B. L.; Tritsch, N. X.\nScore: 60.1, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573485\nAcetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.\nComparative basolateral amygdala connectomics reveals dissociable single-neuron projection patterns to frontal cortex in macaques and mice\nAuthors: Zeisler, Z. R.; Heslin, K. A.; Stoll, F. M.; Hof, P. R.; Clem, R. L.; Rudebeck, P. H.\nScore: 36.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571711\nShort abstractThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects to the frontal cortex (FC) in both rodents and primates, but the comparative organization of single-neuron BLA-FC projections is unknown. Using a barcoded connectomic approach, we found that BLA neurons are more likely to project to multiple distinct parts of FC in mice than in macaques. Further, while single BLA neuron projections to nucleus accumbens are similarly organized in mice and macaques, BLA-FC connections differ.\nMultilayer Network Analysis across Cortical Depths in Resting-State 7T fMRI\nAuthors: Kotlarz, P.; Lankinen, K.; Hakonen, M.; Turpin, T.; Polimeni, J. R.; Ahveninen, J.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573208\nIn graph theory, \"multilayer networks\" represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. A neuroscience example is the hierarchy of connections between different cortical depths or \"lamina\". This hierarchy is becoming non-invasively accessible in humans using ultra-high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7T fMRI (1-mm3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We then compared networks where the inter-regional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (\"layer-by-layer matrices\") to those considering all possible connections between regions and cortical depths (\"multilayer matrix\"). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes such as network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared to the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial aspects of the cortex dominated information transfer and deeper aspects clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic brain regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information. Multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this hierarchy.\nA thalamic hub of action cues coordinates early visual processing and perception\nAuthors: Vega-Zuniga, T.; Sumser, A.; Symonova, O.; Koppensteiner, P.; Schmidt, F. H.; Joesch, M.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573221\nDistinguishing between sensory experiences elicited by external stimuli and an animals own actions is critical for accurate perception. However, the diversity of behaviors and their complex influences on the senses make this distinction challenging. Here, we show that a combination of self-motion cues modulates visual processing in the superficial superior colliculus (sSC), the brains first visual relay. We uncovered a projection from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus to the sSC in mice that functions as a corollary discharge hub, conveying inhibitory signals about translational optic flow and motor dynamics, including saccades, locomotion, and pupil size. Activation of this projection potently dampens visual responses and concurrently drives corresponding motor actions that resemble motor prediction errors; suppression disrupts action-specific visual perception. Our results show that visual signals undergo continuous refinement at the earliest stages through the convergence of self- motion information, ensuring accurate visual perception and visuomotor control.\nA neurotransmitter atlas of the nervous system of C.elegans males and hermaphrodites\nAuthors: Wang, C.; Vidal, B.; Sural, S.; Merritt, D. M.; Toker, I. A.; Vogt, M. C.; Cros, C. C.; Hobert, O.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573258\nAssigning neurotransmitter identity to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. Neurotransmitter identities have been assigned to most neurons in the C. elegans nervous system through the expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant cis-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 13 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter knock-in strains, which report on the deployment of all main types of neurotransmitters in C. elegans (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, tyramine, and octopamine) throughout the entire nervous system of both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia and defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic. Furthermore, we also identified unusual combinations of expression of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive nervous system-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication in C. elegans.\nBreakdown and repair of the aging brain metabolic system\nAuthors: Shichkova, P.; Coggan, J. S.; Kanari, L.; Boci, E.; Favreau, C. P. H.; Antonel, S. M.; Keller, D.; Markram, H.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555341\nThe study presented explores the complex relationship between the aging brain, energy metabolism, blood flow and neuronal activity by introducing a comprehensive, data-driven molecular model of the neuro-glial vascular system, including all key enzymes, transporters, metabolites, and blood flow vital for neuronal electrical activity with 16800 interaction pathways. We find significant alterations in metabolite concentrations and differential effects on ATP supply in neurons and astrocytes and within subcellular compartments within aged brains, and identify reduced Na+/K+-ATPase as the leading cause of impaired neuronal action potentials. The model predicts that the metabolic pathways cluster more closely in the aged brain, suggesting a loss of robustness and adaptability. Additionally, the aged metabolic system displays reduced flexibility, undermining its capacity to efficiently respond to stimuli and recover from damage. Through transcription factor analysis, the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) emerged as a central target connected to these aging-related changes. An unguided optimization search pinpointed potential interventions capable of restoring the brains metabolic flexibility and restoring action potential generation. These strategies include increasing the NADH cytosol-mitochondria shuttle, NAD+ pool, ketone {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, lactate and Na+/K+-ATPase and reducing blood glucose levels. The model is open-sourced to help guide further research in brain metabolism.\nA spectrum of altered non-rapid eye movement sleep in schizophrenia\nAuthors: Kozhemiako, N.; Jiang, C.; Sun, Y.; Guo, Z.; Chapman, S.; Gai, G.; Wang, Z.; Zhou, L.; Li, S.; Law, R. G.; Wang, L. A.; Mylonas, D.; Shen, L.; Murphy, M.; Qin, S.; Zhu, W.; Zhou, Z.; Stickgold, R.; Huang, H.; Tan, S.; Manoach, D. S.; Wang, J.; Hall, M.-H.; Pan, J. Q.; Purcell, S. M.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573548\nBackground: Multiple facets of sleep neurophysiology, including electroencephalography (EEG) metrics such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles and slow oscillations (SO), are altered in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, beyond group-level analyses which treat all patients as a unitary set, the extent to which NREM deficits vary among patients is unclear, as are their relationships to other sources of heterogeneity including clinical factors, illness duration and ageing, cognitive profiles and medication regimens. Using newly collected high density sleep EEG data on 103 individuals with SCZ and 68 controls, we first sought to replicate our previously reported (Kozhemiako et. al, 2022) group-level mean differences between patients and controls (original N=130). Then in the combined sample (N=301 including 175 patients), we characterized patient-to-patient variability in NREM neurophysiology. Results: We replicated all group-level mean differences and confirmed the high accuracy of our predictive model (Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC = 0.93 for diagnosis). Compared to controls, patients showed significantly increased between-individual variability across many (26%) sleep metrics, with patterns only partially recapitulating those for group-level mean differences. Although multiple clinical and cognitive factors were associated with NREM metrics including spindle density, collectively they did not account for much of the general increase in patient-to-patient variability. Medication regimen was a greater (albeit still partial) contributor to variability, although original group mean differences persisted after controlling for medications. Some sleep metrics including fast spindle density showed exaggerated age-related effects in SCZ, and patients exhibited older predicted biological ages based on an independent model of ageing and the sleep EEG. Conclusion: We demonstrated robust and replicable alterations in sleep neurophysiology in individuals with SCZ and highlighted distinct patterns of effects contrasting between-group means versus within-group variances. We further documented and controlled for a major effect of medication use, and pointed to greater age-related change in NREM sleep in patients. That increased NREM heterogeneity was not explained by standard clinical or cognitive patient assessments suggests the sleep EEG provides novel, nonredundant information to support the goals of personalized medicine. Collectively, our results point to a spectrum of NREM sleep deficits among SCZ patients that can be measured objectively and at scale, and that may offer a unique window on the etiological and genetic diversity that underlies SCZ risk, treatment response and prognosis.\nUnsupervised mapping of causal relations between brain and behavior\nAuthors: Wahle, I. A.; Adolphs, R.; Tranel, D.; Boes, A.; Eberhardt, F.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573110\nStudies of patients with focal brain lesions provided the historical foundation for cognitive neuroscience, but how to identify a precise mapping between specific brain regions and the cognitive variables affected remains unclear. The challenge lies both in identifying anatomical regions wherein lesions have a shared causal effect, as well as in the precise delineation of the behavioral outcome. Currently, either the relevant brain region or the dimensionality of the behavior being mapped are pre-specified by the investigators rather than both being informed by optimal brain-behavior relationships. Here we apply a novel data-driven causal aggregation algorithm, Causal Feature Learning (CFL) to tackle this challenge in 520 individuals with focal brain lesions. CFL simultaneously constructs macro-level summaries of the spatial distribution of brain lesions and the itemized responses on psychometric tests to optimally characterize the causal brain-behavior relationships. Focusing on the domains of language, visuospatial ability, and depression, we recapitulate established findings, provide new and more precise anatomical results, and present an aggregation of item-wise data that provides an empirical test of extant behavioral scores and can be used to identify novel, psychologically meaningful factors. Future work could use our approach to construct entirely new psychometric variables that might cut across established categories.\nSingle-nucleus multiomic atlas of frontal cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with a deep learning-based decoding of alternative polyadenylation mechanisms\nAuthors: McKeever, P.

G.; Keith, J.; Zinman, L.; Rogaeva, E.; Goodarzi, H.; Bader, G.; Robertson, J.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573083\nThe understanding of how different cell types contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis is limited. Here we generated a single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the frontal cortex of ALS cases with C9orf72 (C9) hexanucleotide repeat expansions and sporadic ALS (sALS). Our findings reveal shared pathways in C9-ALS and sALS, characterized by synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons and a disease-associated state in microglia. The disease subtypes diverge with loss of astrocyte homeostasis in C9-ALS, and a more substantial disturbance of inhibitory neurons in sALS. Leveraging high depth 3-end sequencing, we found a widespread switch towards distal polyadenylation (PA) site usage across ALS subtypes relative to controls. To explore this differential alternative PA (APA), we developed APA-Net, a deep neural network model that uses transcript sequence and expression levels of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to predict cell-type specific APA usage and RBP interactions likely to regulate APA across disease subtypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Religious fundamentalism, characterized by rigid adherence to a set of beliefs putatively revealing inerrant truths, is ubiquitous across cultures and has a global impact on society. Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobes. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets (r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-induced conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with hemispheric specializations in reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.</p>

Using a barcoded connectomic approach, we found that BLA neurons are more likely to project to multiple distinct parts of FC in mice than in macaques. Further, while single BLA neuron projections to nucleus accumbens are similarly organized in mice and macaques, BLA-FC connections differ.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In graph theory, &#34;multilayer networks&#34; represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. A neuroscience example is the hierarchy of connections between different cortical depths or &#34;lamina&#34;. This hierarchy is becoming non-invasively accessible in humans using ultra-high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7T fMRI (1-mm3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We then compared networks where the inter-regional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (&#34;layer-by-layer matrices&#34;) to those considering all possible connections between regions and cortical depths (&#34;multilayer matrix&#34;). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes such as network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared to the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial aspects of the cortex dominated information transfer and deeper aspects clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic brain regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information. Multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this hierarchy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Distinguishing between sensory experiences elicited by external stimuli and an animals own actions is critical for accurate perception. However, the diversity of behaviors and their complex influences on the senses make this distinction challenging. Here, we show that a combination of self-motion cues modulates visual processing in the superficial superior colliculus (sSC), the brains first visual relay. We uncovered a projection from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus to the sSC in mice that functions as a corollary discharge hub, conveying inhibitory signals about translational optic flow and motor dynamics, including saccades, locomotion, and pupil size. Activation of this projection potently dampens visual responses and concurrently drives corresponding motor actions that resemble motor prediction errors; suppression disrupts action-specific visual perception. Our results show that visual signals undergo continuous refinement at the earliest stages through the convergence of self- motion information, ensuring accurate visual perception and visuomotor control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assigning neurotransmitter identity to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. Neurotransmitter identities have been assigned to most neurons in the C. elegans nervous system through the expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant cis-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 13 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter knock-in strains, which report on the deployment of all main types of neurotransmitters in C. elegans (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, tyramine, and octopamine) throughout the entire nervous system of both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia and defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic. Furthermore, we also identified unusual combinations of expression of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive nervous system-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication in C. elegans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The study presented explores the complex relationship between the aging brain, energy metabolism, blood flow and neuronal activity by introducing a comprehensive, data-driven molecular model of the neuro-glial vascular system, including all key enzymes, transporters, metabolites, and blood flow vital for neuronal electrical activity with 16800 interaction pathways. We find significant alterations in metabolite concentrations and differential effects on ATP supply in neurons and astrocytes and within subcellular compartments within aged brains, and identify reduced Na&#43;/K&#43;-ATPase as the leading cause of impaired neuronal action potentials. The model predicts that the metabolic pathways cluster more closely in the aged brain, suggesting a loss of robustness and adaptability. Additionally, the aged metabolic system displays reduced flexibility, undermining its capacity to efficiently respond to stimuli and recover from damage. Through transcription factor analysis, the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) emerged as a central target connected to these aging-related changes. An unguided optimization search pinpointed potential interventions capable of restoring the brains metabolic flexibility and restoring action potential generation. These strategies include increasing the NADH cytosol-mitochondria shuttle, NAD&#43; pool, ketone {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, lactate and Na&#43;/K&#43;-ATPase and reducing blood glucose levels. The model is open-sourced to help guide further research in brain metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Multiple facets of sleep neurophysiology, including electroencephalography (EEG) metrics such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles and slow oscillations (SO), are altered in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, beyond group-level analyses which treat all patients as a unitary set, the extent to which NREM deficits vary among patients is unclear, as are their relationships to other sources of heterogeneity including clinical factors, illness duration and ageing, cognitive profiles and medication regimens. Using newly collected high density sleep EEG data on 103 individuals with SCZ and 68 controls, we first sought to replicate our previously reported (Kozhemiako et. al, 2022) group-level mean differences between patients and controls (original N=130). Then in the combined sample (N=301 including 175 patients), we characterized patient-to-patient variability in NREM neurophysiology. Results: We replicated all group-level mean differences and confirmed the high accuracy of our predictive model (Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC = 0.93 for diagnosis). Compared to controls, patients showed significantly increased between-individual variability across many (26%) sleep metrics, with patterns only partially recapitulating those for group-level mean differences. Although multiple clinical and cognitive factors were associated with NREM metrics including spindle density, collectively they did not account for much of the general increase in patient-to-patient variability. Medication regimen was a greater (albeit still partial) contributor to variability, although original group mean differences persisted after controlling for medications. Some sleep metrics including fast spindle density showed exaggerated age-related effects in SCZ, and patients exhibited older predicted biological ages based on an independent model of ageing and the sleep EEG. Conclusion: We demonstrated robust and replicable alterations in sleep neurophysiology in individuals with SCZ and highlighted distinct patterns of effects contrasting between-group means versus within-group variances. We further documented and controlled for a major effect of medication use, and pointed to greater age-related change in NREM sleep in patients. That increased NREM heterogeneity was not explained by standard clinical or cognitive patient assessments suggests the sleep EEG provides novel, nonredundant information to support the goals of personalized medicine. Collectively, our results point to a spectrum of NREM sleep deficits among SCZ patients that can be measured objectively and at scale, and that may offer a unique window on the etiological and genetic diversity that underlies SCZ risk, treatment response and prognosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies of patients with focal brain lesions provided the historical foundation for cognitive neuroscience, but how to identify a precise mapping between specific brain regions and the cognitive variables affected remains unclear. The challenge lies both in identifying anatomical regions wherein lesions have a shared causal effect, as well as in the precise delineation of the behavioral outcome. Currently, either the relevant brain region or the dimensionality of the behavior being mapped are pre-specified by the investigators rather than both being informed by optimal brain-behavior relationships. Here we apply a novel data-driven causal aggregation algorithm, Causal Feature Learning (CFL) to tackle this challenge in 520 individuals with focal brain lesions. CFL simultaneously constructs macro-level summaries of the spatial distribution of brain lesions and the itemized responses on psychometric tests to optimally characterize the causal brain-behavior relationships. Focusing on the domains of language, visuospatial ability, and depression, we recapitulate established findings, provide new and more precise anatomical results, and present an aggregation of item-wise data that provides an empirical test of extant behavioral scores and can be used to identify novel, psychologically meaningful factors. Future work could use our approach to construct entirely new psychometric variables that might cut across established categories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The understanding of how different cell types contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis is limited. Here we generated a single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the frontal cortex of ALS cases with C9orf72 (C9) hexanucleotide repeat expansions and sporadic ALS (sALS). Our findings reveal shared pathways in C9-ALS and sALS, characterized by synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons and a disease-associated state in microglia. The disease subtypes diverge with loss of astrocyte homeostasis in C9-ALS, and a more substantial disturbance of inhibitory neurons in sALS. Leveraging high depth 3-end sequencing, we found a widespread switch towards distal polyadenylation (PA) site usage across ALS subtypes relative to controls. To explore this differential alternative PA (APA), we developed APA-Net, a deep neural network model that uses transcript sequence and expression levels of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to predict cell-type specific APA usage and RBP interactions likely to regulate APA across disease subtypes.</p>
