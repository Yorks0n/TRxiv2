However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.\nWhole-cortex in situ sequencing reveals peripheral input-dependent cell type-defined area identity\nAuthors: Chen, X.; Fischer, S.; Rue, M. C.; Zhang, A.; Mukherjee, D.; Kanold, P. O.; Gillis, J.; Zador, A.\nScore: 131.4, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.06.515380\nThe cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.\nA dual-pathway architecture enables chronic stress to promote habit formation\nAuthors: Giovanniello, J. R.; Paredes, N.; Wiener, A.; Ramirez-Armenta, K.; Oragwam, C.; Uwadia, H. O.; Lim, K.; Nnamdi, G.; Wang, A.; Sehgal, M.; Reis, F. M.; Sias, A. C.; Silva, A. J.; Adhikari, A.; Malvaez, M.; Wassum, K. M.\nScore: 43.4, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560731\nChronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions by promoting the formation of inflexible, potentially maladaptive, habits. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual pathway, amygdala-striatal, neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress shapes learning to disrupt flexible goal-directed behavior in favor of inflexible habits. Chronic stress inhibits activity of basolateral amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to impede the action-outcome learning that supports flexible, goal-directed decisions. Stress also increases activity in direct central amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to promote the formation of rigid, inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala-striatal pathways to promote premature habit formation. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision making, and help understand how stress can lead to the disrupted decision making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions.\nSynaptic Basis of Behavioral Timescale Plasticity\nAuthors: Gonzalez, K. C.; Negrean, A.; Liao, Z.; Polleux, F.; Losonczy, A.\nScore: 29.5, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560848\nLearning and memory are fundamental to adaptive behavior and cognition. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of feature selectivity in neurons underlying episodic memory. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at single-neuron resolution in awake-behaving animals. Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) postulates that synaptic inputs active during a seconds-long time window preceding and immediately following a large depolarizing plateau spike are potentiated, while synaptic inputs active outside this time window are depressed. We experimentally tested this model in vivo in awake-behaving mice using an all-optical approach by inducing place fields (PFs) in single CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1PNs) while monitoring the spatiotemporal tuning of individual dendritic spines and changes in their corresponding synaptic weights. We identified an asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around plateau burst induction. Surprisingly, our work also uncovered compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal and oblique dendrites of CA1PNs. Our results provide the first experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.\nThe COMBO window: A chronic cranial implant for multiscale circuit interrogation in mice\nAuthors: Edelman, B.; Siegenthaler, D.; Wanken, P.; Jenkins, B.; Schmid, B.; Ressle, A.; Gogolla, N.; Frank, T.; Mace, E.\nScore: 26.0, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560470\nNeuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca2+ imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures, and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant - the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multi-site two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.\nAdolescent oligodendrogenesis and myelination restrict experience-dependent neuronal plasticity in adult visual cortex\nAuthors: Xin, W.; Kaneko, M.; Roth, R. H.; Zhang, A.; Nocera, S.; Ding, J. B.; Stryker, M. P.; Chan, J. R.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560231\nBACKGROUNDDevelopmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age. We tested this hypothesis in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. OBJECTIVES/METHODSTo prevent myelin progression, we conditionally deleted Myrf, a transcription factor necessary for oligodendrocyte maturation, from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Myrf cKO) in adolescent mice. To induce experience-dependent plasticity, adult control and Myrf cKO mice were monocularly deprived by eyelid suture. Functional and structural neuronal plasticity in the visual cortex were assessed in vivo by intrinsic signal optical imaging and longitudinal two photon imaging of dendritic spines, respectively. RESULTSDuring adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. Myrf deletion from oligodendrocyte precursors during adolescence led to inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that persisted into adulthood. Following monocular deprivation, visual cortex activity in response to visual stimulation of the deprived eye remained stable in adult control mice, as expected for post-critical period animals. By contrast, visual cortex responses to the deprived eye decreased significantly following monocular deprivation in adult Myrf cKO mice, reminiscent of the plasticity observed in adolescent mice. Furthermore, visual cortex neurons in adult Myrf cKO mice had fewer dendritic spines and a higher level of spine turnover. Finally, monocular deprivation induced spatially coordinated spine size decreases in adult Myrf cKO, but not control, mice. CONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrate a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of myelin acting as a brake on neuronal plasticity during development.\nPlacebo treatment affects brain systems related to affective and cognitive processes, but not nociceptive pain\nAuthors: Botvinik-Nezer, R.; Petre, B.; Ceko, M.; Lindquist, M. A.; Friedman, N. P.; Wager, T. D.\nScore: 32.4, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558825\nPlacebo analgesia is a replicable and well-studied phenomenon, yet it remains unclear to what degree it includes modulation of nociceptive processes. Some studies find effects consistent with nociceptive effects, but meta-analyses show that these effects are often small. We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain. Our results indicate that processes related to affective and cognitive aspects of pain primarily drive placebo analgesia.\nCadherins orchestrate specific patterns of perisomatic inhibition onto distinct pyramidal cell populations\nAuthors: Jezequel, J.; Condomitti, G.; Kroon, T.; Hamid, F.; Sanalidou, S.; Garces, T.; Maeso, P.; Balia, M.; Rico, B.\nScore: 25.7, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559922\nIn the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells are assembled into distinct subnetworks, which project to different brain areas. GABAergic interneurons were long thought to connect promiscuously and extensively to pyramidal neurons, but recent evidence supports the existence of a cell type-specific inhibitory connectome. How and when interneurons establish such a precise connectivity pattern among intermingled populations of excitatory neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular rules shaping cell type- and input-specific inhibitory connectivity in different Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell populations. We found that neighboring L5 intra- (L5 IT) and extra-telencephalic (L5 ET) neurons receive different combinations of inhibitory perisomatic inputs from Parvalbumin- (PV+) and Cholecystokynine-positive (CCK+) basket cells. We also identified Cdh12 and Cdh13, two cadherin superfamily members, as critical mediators of L5 pyramidal cell type-specific inhibitory connectivity. Our data revealed a minimal overlap between L5 IT and L5 ET presynaptic inhibitory networks, and suggests that different populations PV+ basket cells innervate distinct L5 pyramidal cell types. Altogether, our work unravels the contribution of cadherins in shaping cortical interneuron wiring and provides new insights into the development of inhibitory microcircuits.\nObjects, faces, and spaces: Organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior\nAuthors: Sigurdardottir, H. M.; Olafsdottir, I. M.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560383\nWhat are the diagnostic dimensions on which objects truly differ visually, and do these dimensions provide the foundation for the organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior? Using data-driven methods, we utilized a deep convolutional neural network to construct a visual object space extracted from deep layer activations for a reference set of objects. The first two dimensions of object space capture attributes that distinguish one object from another and may map onto the anatomical organization of the ventral visual stream of non-human primates, but its existence in humans is unclear. If object space underlies human visual cognition, this should have a measurable effect on peoples object discrimination. We focused on the so-called face quadrant of object space, as there are considerable individual differences in face discrimination abilities, and a lively debate has revolved around whether such abilities are specific to faces. In this preregistered study, we collected data from a large (N=511) heterogeneous sample to amplify individual differences in visual discrimination. We primarily targeted people with self-declared face recognition abilities on opposite sides of the spectrum, ranging from poor to excellent face recognizers. We then administered a visual foraging task where faces and other objects had to be discriminated. Stimuli were carefully picked out of tens of thousands of images to either match or not match with the coordinates of faces in object space. Results showed that face discrimination did not rely on completely domain-specific abilities but also tapped into mechanisms that supported other object discrimination. Specifically, people who struggled with telling apart faces also had difficulties with discriminating other objects from the face quadrant of object space. To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first behavioral evidence for the existence of an object space in human visual cognition.\nMulti-donor human cortical Chimeroids reveal individual susceptibility to neurotoxic triggers\nAuthors: Anton-Bolanos, N.; Faravelli, I.; Faits, T.; Andreadis, S.; Trattaro, S.; Kastli, R.; Adiconis, X.; Di Bella, D. J.; Tegtmeyer, M.; Nehme, R.; Levin, J. Z.; Regev, A.; Arlotta, P.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.558331\nInter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain Chimeroids, a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By re-aggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with a wide range of long COVID neurological symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture (Brodmann 1909; Vogt and Vogt 1919; Von Bonin 1947), connectivity (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019), and neuronal activity (Schwarz et al. 2008; Ferrarini et al. 2009; He et al. 2009; Meunier et al. 2010; Bertolero et al. 2015), are wired into modular networks (Zingg et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020). However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies(Yao et al. 2021a; Yao et al. 2021b). Gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas, and the composition of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we compared the cell type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Strikingly, binocular enucleation caused the cell type compositional profiles of visual areas to shift towards neighboring areas within the same cortical module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high-throughput, low-cost, and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof-of-principle for using large-scale in situ sequencing to reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and to understand its development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions by promoting the formation of inflexible, potentially maladaptive, habits. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual pathway, amygdala-striatal, neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress shapes learning to disrupt flexible goal-directed behavior in favor of inflexible habits. Chronic stress inhibits activity of basolateral amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to impede the action-outcome learning that supports flexible, goal-directed decisions. Stress also increases activity in direct central amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to promote the formation of rigid, inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala-striatal pathways to promote premature habit formation. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision making, and help understand how stress can lead to the disrupted decision making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning and memory are fundamental to adaptive behavior and cognition. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of feature selectivity in neurons underlying episodic memory. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at single-neuron resolution in awake-behaving animals. Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) postulates that synaptic inputs active during a seconds-long time window preceding and immediately following a large depolarizing plateau spike are potentiated, while synaptic inputs active outside this time window are depressed. We experimentally tested this model in vivo in awake-behaving mice using an all-optical approach by inducing place fields (PFs) in single CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1PNs) while monitoring the spatiotemporal tuning of individual dendritic spines and changes in their corresponding synaptic weights. We identified an asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around plateau burst induction. Surprisingly, our work also uncovered compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal and oblique dendrites of CA1PNs. Our results provide the first experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca2&#43; imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures, and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant - the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multi-site two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDDevelopmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age. We tested this hypothesis in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity.

OBJECTIVES/METHODSTo prevent myelin progression, we conditionally deleted Myrf, a transcription factor necessary for oligodendrocyte maturation, from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Myrf cKO) in adolescent mice. To induce experience-dependent plasticity, adult control and Myrf cKO mice were monocularly deprived by eyelid suture. Functional and structural neuronal plasticity in the visual cortex were assessed in vivo by intrinsic signal optical imaging and longitudinal two photon imaging of dendritic spines, respectively.

RESULTSDuring adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. Myrf deletion from oligodendrocyte precursors during adolescence led to inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that persisted into adulthood. Following monocular deprivation, visual cortex activity in response to visual stimulation of the deprived eye remained stable in adult control mice, as expected for post-critical period animals. By contrast, visual cortex responses to the deprived eye decreased significantly following monocular deprivation in adult Myrf cKO mice, reminiscent of the plasticity observed in adolescent mice. Furthermore, visual cortex neurons in adult Myrf cKO mice had fewer dendritic spines and a higher level of spine turnover. Finally, monocular deprivation induced spatially coordinated spine size decreases in adult Myrf cKO, but not control, mice.

CONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrate a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of myelin acting as a brake on neuronal plasticity during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Placebo analgesia is a replicable and well-studied phenomenon, yet it remains unclear to what degree it includes modulation of nociceptive processes. Some studies find effects consistent with nociceptive effects, but meta-analyses show that these effects are often small. We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain. Our results indicate that processes related to affective and cognitive aspects of pain primarily drive placebo analgesia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells are assembled into distinct subnetworks, which project to different brain areas. GABAergic interneurons were long thought to connect promiscuously and extensively to pyramidal neurons, but recent evidence supports the existence of a cell type-specific inhibitory connectome. How and when interneurons establish such a precise connectivity pattern among intermingled populations of excitatory neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular rules shaping cell type- and input-specific inhibitory connectivity in different Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell populations. We found that neighboring L5 intra- (L5 IT) and extra-telencephalic (L5 ET) neurons receive different combinations of inhibitory perisomatic inputs from Parvalbumin- (PV&#43;) and Cholecystokynine-positive (CCK&#43;) basket cells. We also identified Cdh12 and Cdh13, two cadherin superfamily members, as critical mediators of L5 pyramidal cell type-specific inhibitory connectivity. Our data revealed a minimal overlap between L5 IT and L5 ET presynaptic inhibitory networks, and suggests that different populations PV&#43; basket cells innervate distinct L5 pyramidal cell types. Altogether, our work unravels the contribution of cadherins in shaping cortical interneuron wiring and provides new insights into the development of inhibitory microcircuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">What are the diagnostic dimensions on which objects truly differ visually, and do these dimensions provide the foundation for the organizational principles of visual object perception as evidenced by individual differences in behavior? Using data-driven methods, we utilized a deep convolutional neural network to construct a visual object space extracted from deep layer activations for a reference set of objects. The first two dimensions of object space capture attributes that distinguish one object from another and may map onto the anatomical organization of the ventral visual stream of non-human primates, but its existence in humans is unclear. If object space underlies human visual cognition, this should have a measurable effect on peoples object discrimination. We focused on the so-called face quadrant of object space, as there are considerable individual differences in face discrimination abilities, and a lively debate has revolved around whether such abilities are specific to faces. In this preregistered study, we collected data from a large (N=511) heterogeneous sample to amplify individual differences in visual discrimination. We primarily targeted people with self-declared face recognition abilities on opposite sides of the spectrum, ranging from poor to excellent face recognizers. We then administered a visual foraging task where faces and other objects had to be discriminated. Stimuli were carefully picked out of tens of thousands of images to either match or not match with the coordinates of faces in object space. Results showed that face discrimination did not rely on completely domain-specific abilities but also tapped into mechanisms that supported other object discrimination. Specifically, people who struggled with telling apart faces also had difficulties with discriminating other objects from the face quadrant of object space. To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first behavioral evidence for the existence of an object space in human visual cognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-individual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases. Efforts to study the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of human genetic variation on normal development and disease phenotypes are limited, however, by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple individuals. Here, we present human brain Chimeroids, a highly reproducible, multi-donor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid, while maintaining fidelity to endogenous tissue. By re-aggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem or committed progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We leveraged Chimeroids to investigate inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic stressors that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results show that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of the contribution of human genetic variation to brain development and disease.</p>
