Here, we identified two distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate Krause corpuscles of the mouse penis and clitoris and project to a unique sensory terminal region of the spinal cord. Using in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we found that both Krause corpuscle afferent types are A-fiber rapid-adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, optimally tuned to dynamic, light touch and mechanical vibrations (40-80 Hz) applied to the clitoris or penis. Optogenetic activation of male Krause corpuscle afferent terminals evoked penile erection, while genetic ablation of Krause corpuscles impaired intromission and ejaculation of males as well as reduced sexual receptivity of females. Thus, Krause corpuscles, which are particularly dense in the clitoris, are vibrotactile sensors crucial for normal sexual behavior.\nA Brain-Wide Map of Neural Activity during Complex Behaviour\nAuthors: International Brain Lab, ; Benson, B.; Benson, J.; Birman, D.; Bonacchi, N.; Carandini, M.; Catarino, J.

It has proven difficult to meet this challenge when different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here, we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 115 mice in 11 labs performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor, and cognitive components, obtained with 547 Neuropixels probe insertions covering 267 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map, assessing how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli appeared transiently in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of mid- and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption versus reward omission were also widespread. Representations of objective prior expectations were weaker, found in sparse sets of neurons from restricted regions. This publicly available dataset represents an unprecedented resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.\nWhat can 1.8 billion regressions tell us about the pressures shaping high-level visual representation in brains and machines?\nAuthors: Conwell, C.; Prince, J.

A.; Konkle, T.\nScore: 102.9, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.28.485868\nThe rapid development and open-source release of highly performant computer vision models offers new potential for examining how different inductive biases impact representation learning and emergent alignment with the high-level human ventral visual system. Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.\nNeuronal wiring diagram of an adult brain\nAuthors: Dorkenwald, S.; Matsliah, A.; Sterling, A.

In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x10^7 chemical synapses between ~130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.\nA consensus cell type atlas from multiple connectomes reveals principles of circuit stereotypy and variation\nAuthors: Schlegel, P.; Yin, Y.; Bates, A.

A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the \"hemibrain\" connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing \u003e1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.\nBrain-wide representations of prior information in mouse decision-making\nAuthors: Findling, C.; Hubert, F.; International Brain Laboratory, ; Acerbi, L.; Benson, B.; Benson, J.; Birman, D.; Bonacchi, N.; Carandini, M.; Catarino, J.

To investigate this issue, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions which, remarkably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (LGd, VISp) to motor regions (MOs, MOp, GRN) and high level cortical regions (ACCd, ORBvl). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision making areas. This study offers the first brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large scale recordings on a single standardized task.\nPutting cognitive tasks on trial: A measure of reliability convergence\nAuthors: Kadlec, J.; Walsh, C.; Sade, U.; Amir, A.; Rissman, J.; Ramot, M.\nScore: 59.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547563\nThe surge in interest in individual differences has coincided with the latest replication crisis centered around brain-wide association studies of brain-behavior correlations. Yet the reliability of the measures we use in cognitive neuroscience, a crucial component of this brain-behavior relationship, is often assumed but not directly tested. Here, we evaluate the reliability of different cognitive tasks on a large dataset of over 250 participants, who each completed a multi-day task battery. We show how reliability improves as a function of number of trials, and describe the convergence of the reliability curves for the different tasks, allowing us to score tasks according to their suitability for studies of individual differences. To improve the accessibility of these findings, we designed a simple web-based tool that implements this function to calculate the convergence factor and predict the expected reliability for any given number of trials and participants, even based on limited pilot data.\nCellular Substrate of Eligibility Traces\nAuthors: Caya-Bissonnette, L.; Naud, R.; Beïque, J.-C.\nScore: 36.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547097\nThe ability of synapses to undergo associative, activity-dependent weight changes constitutes a linchpin of current cellular models of learning and memory. It is, however, unclear whether canonical forms of Hebbian plasticity, which inherently detect correlations of cellular events occurring over short time scales, can solve the temporal credit assignment problem proper to learning driven by delayed behavioral outcomes. Recent evidence supports the existence of synaptic eligibility traces, a time decaying process that renders synapses momentarily eligible for a weight update by a delayed instructive signal. While eligibility traces offer a means of retrospective credit assignment, their material nature is unknown. Here, we combined whole-cell recordings with two-photon uncaging, calcium imaging and biophysical modeling to address this question. We observed and parameterized a form of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mice prefrontal areas wherein the pairing of temporally separated pre- and postsynaptic events (0.5 s - 1 s), irrespective of order, induced synaptic potentiation. By imaging calcium in apical oblique dendrites, we reveal a short-term and associative plasticity of calcium dynamics (STAPCD) whose time-dependence mirrored the induction rules of BTSP. We identified a core set of molecular players that were essential for both STAPCD and BTSP and that, together with computational simulations, support a model wherein the dynamics of intracellular handling of calcium by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides a latent memory trace of neural activity that instantiates synaptic weight updates upon a delayed instructive signal. By satisfying the requirements expected of eligibility traces, this mechanism accounts for how individual neurons can conjunctively bind cellular events that are separated by behaviorally relevant temporal delays, and thus offers a cellular model of reinforced learning.\nThe neural basis of defensive behaviour evolution in Peromyscus mice\nAuthors: Baier, F.; Reinhard, K.; Tong, V.; Murman, J.; Farrow, K.; Hoekstra, H.\nScore: 34.5, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547734\nEvading imminent predator threat is critical for survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours is still poorly understood. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) show different responses to the same looming stimulus: P. maniculatus, which occupy densely vegetated habitats, predominantly dart to escape, while the open field specialist, P. polionotus, pause their movement. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. While dPAG activity scales with running speed and involves both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in P. maniculatus, the dPAG is largely silent in P. polionotus, even when darting is triggered. Moreover, optogenetic activation of excitatory dPAG neurons reliably elicits darting behaviour in P. maniculatus but not P. polionotus. Together, we trace the evolution of species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the complex mammalian brain.\nAcquisition of non-olfactory encoding improves odour discrimination in olfactory cortex\nAuthors: Federman, N.; Romano, S. A.; Amigo-Duran, M.; Salomon, L.; Marin-Burgin, A.\nScore: 31.4, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547685\nPrimary sensory cortices, initially considered elementary encoders of physicochemical attributes of environmental stimuli, are now known to be modulated by other aspects of experience, such as attentional state and internal expectations 1-3, movement-related signals 4-7 and spatial information 2, 8, 9. However, the specific role of these signals in cortical sensory processing is not fully understood 10. Here we reveal multiple and diverse non-olfactory responses in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex (PCx), which dynamically enhance PCx odour discrimination according to behavioural demands. We designed a behavioural task using a virtual reality environment and performed recordings in PCx neurons. In this task, mice were trained to associate specific odours with visual contexts in order to receive a reward. We found that learning shifts PCx activity from encoding solely odour identity to a more complex regime. In this regime, positional, contextual, and associative responses emerge on odour-responsive neurons that thus become mixed-selective. Contextual information is sustained in PCx activity of expert animals, specifically when visual context identity is needed to solve the task. After learning, odours are better decoded from PCx activity when mice are engaged in the task and when odours are presented within a rewarded context. This enhancement of PCx olfactory processing is reliant on the acquired mixed-selectivity. Thus, the integration of extra-sensory inputs within primary sensory cortices can encode the behavioural relevance of encountered stimuli while improving sensory processing.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Krause corpuscles, first discovered in the 1850s, are enigmatic sensory structures with unknown physiological properties and functions found within the genitalia and other mucocutaneous tissues. Here, we identified two distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate Krause corpuscles of the mouse penis and clitoris and project to a unique sensory terminal region of the spinal cord. Using in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we found that both Krause corpuscle afferent types are A-fiber rapid-adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, optimally tuned to dynamic, light touch and mechanical vibrations (40-80 Hz) applied to the clitoris or penis. Optogenetic activation of male Krause corpuscle afferent terminals evoked penile erection, while genetic ablation of Krause corpuscles impaired intromission and ejaculation of males as well as reduced sexual receptivity of females. Thus, Krause corpuscles, which are particularly dense in the clitoris, are vibrotactile sensors crucial for normal sexual behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with prior expectations to initiate movements. It has proven difficult to meet this challenge when different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here, we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 115 mice in 11 labs performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor, and cognitive components, obtained with 547 Neuropixels probe insertions covering 267 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map, assessing how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli appeared transiently in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of mid- and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption versus reward omission were also widespread. Representations of objective prior expectations were weaker, found in sparse sets of neurons from restricted regions. This publicly available dataset represents an unprecedented resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid development and open-source release of highly performant computer vision models offers new potential for examining how different inductive biases impact representation learning and emergent alignment with the high-level human ventral visual system. Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analyzing electron microscopic (EM) brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x10^7 chemical synapses between ~130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the &#34;hemibrain&#34; connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing &gt;1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions which, remarkably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (LGd, VISp) to motor regions (MOs, MOp, GRN) and high level cortical regions (ACCd, ORBvl). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision making areas. This study offers the first brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large scale recordings on a single standardized task.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The surge in interest in individual differences has coincided with the latest replication crisis centered around brain-wide association studies of brain-behavior correlations. Yet the reliability of the measures we use in cognitive neuroscience, a crucial component of this brain-behavior relationship, is often assumed but not directly tested. Here, we evaluate the reliability of different cognitive tasks on a large dataset of over 250 participants, who each completed a multi-day task battery. We show how reliability improves as a function of number of trials, and describe the convergence of the reliability curves for the different tasks, allowing us to score tasks according to their suitability for studies of individual differences. To improve the accessibility of these findings, we designed a simple web-based tool that implements this function to calculate the convergence factor and predict the expected reliability for any given number of trials and participants, even based on limited pilot data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of synapses to undergo associative, activity-dependent weight changes constitutes a linchpin of current cellular models of learning and memory. It is, however, unclear whether canonical forms of Hebbian plasticity, which inherently detect correlations of cellular events occurring over short time scales, can solve the temporal credit assignment problem proper to learning driven by delayed behavioral outcomes. Recent evidence supports the existence of synaptic eligibility traces, a time decaying process that renders synapses momentarily eligible for a weight update by a delayed instructive signal. While eligibility traces offer a means of retrospective credit assignment, their material nature is unknown. Here, we combined whole-cell recordings with two-photon uncaging, calcium imaging and biophysical modeling to address this question. We observed and parameterized a form of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mice prefrontal areas wherein the pairing of temporally separated pre- and postsynaptic events (0.5 s - 1 s), irrespective of order, induced synaptic potentiation. By imaging calcium in apical oblique dendrites, we reveal a short-term and associative plasticity of calcium dynamics (STAPCD) whose time-dependence mirrored the induction rules of BTSP. We identified a core set of molecular players that were essential for both STAPCD and BTSP and that, together with computational simulations, support a model wherein the dynamics of intracellular handling of calcium by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides a latent memory trace of neural activity that instantiates synaptic weight updates upon a delayed instructive signal. By satisfying the requirements expected of eligibility traces, this mechanism accounts for how individual neurons can conjunctively bind cellular events that are separated by behaviorally relevant temporal delays, and thus offers a cellular model of reinforced learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evading imminent predator threat is critical for survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours is still poorly understood. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) show different responses to the same looming stimulus: P. maniculatus, which occupy densely vegetated habitats, predominantly dart to escape, while the open field specialist, P. polionotus, pause their movement. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. While dPAG activity scales with running speed and involves both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in P. maniculatus, the dPAG is largely silent in P. polionotus, even when darting is triggered. Moreover, optogenetic activation of excitatory dPAG neurons reliably elicits darting behaviour in P. maniculatus but not P. polionotus. Together, we trace the evolution of species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the complex mammalian brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primary sensory cortices, initially considered elementary encoders of physicochemical attributes of environmental stimuli, are now known to be modulated by other aspects of experience, such as attentional state and internal expectations 1-3, movement-related signals 4-7 and spatial information 2, 8, 9. However, the specific role of these signals in cortical sensory processing is not fully understood 10. Here we reveal multiple and diverse non-olfactory responses in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex (PCx), which dynamically enhance PCx odour discrimination according to behavioural demands. We designed a behavioural task using a virtual reality environment and performed recordings in PCx neurons. In this task, mice were trained to associate specific odours with visual contexts in order to receive a reward. We found that learning shifts PCx activity from encoding solely odour identity to a more complex regime. In this regime, positional, contextual, and associative responses emerge on odour-responsive neurons that thus become mixed-selective. Contextual information is sustained in PCx activity of expert animals, specifically when visual context identity is needed to solve the task. After learning, odours are better decoded from PCx activity when mice are engaged in the task and when odours are presented within a rewarded context. This enhancement of PCx olfactory processing is reliant on the acquired mixed-selectivity. Thus, the integration of extra-sensory inputs within primary sensory cortices can encode the behavioural relevance of encountered stimuli while improving sensory processing.</p>
