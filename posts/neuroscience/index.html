Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 {micro}m resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness. One sentence summaryWe performed ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map brainstem connections that sustain wakefulness in human consciousness.\nBarcoding of episodic memories in the hippocampus of a food-caching bird\nAuthors: Chettih, S. N.; Mackevicius, E. L.; Hale, S.; Aronov, D.\nScore: 236.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.27.542597\nEpisodic memory, or memory of experienced events, is a critical function of the hippocampus1-3. It is therefore important to understand how hippocampal activity represents specific events in an animals life. We addressed this question in chickadees - specialist food-caching birds that hide food at scattered locations and use memory to find their caches later in time4, 5. We performed high-density neural recordings in the hippocampus of chickadees as they cached and retrieved seeds in a laboratory arena. We found that each caching event was represented by a burst of firing in a unique set of hippocampal neurons. These barcode-like patterns of activity were sparse (\u003c10% of neurons active), uncorrelated even for immediately adjacent caches, and different even for separate caches at the same location. The barcode representing a specific caching event was transiently reactivated whenever a bird later interacted with the same cache - for example, to retrieve food. Barcodes co-occurred with conventional place cell activity6, 7, as well as location-independent responses to cached seeds. We propose that barcodes are signatures of episodic memories evoked during memory recall. These patterns assign a unique identifier to each event and may be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.\nA modular chemigenetic calcium indicator enables in vivo functional imaging with near-infrared light\nAuthors: Farrants, H.; Shuai, Y.; Lemon, W. C.; Hernandez, C. M.; Yang, S.; Patel, R.; Qiao, G.; Frei, M. S.; Grimm, J. B.; Hanson, T. L.; Tomaska, F.; Turner, G. C.; Stringer, C.; Keller, P. J.; Beyene, A. G.; Chen, Y.; Liang, Y.; Lavis, L. D.; Schreiter, E. R.\nScore: 50.0, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549527\nGenetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators have revolutionized neuroscience and other biological fields by allowing cellular-resolution recording of physiology during behavior. However, we currently lack bright, genetically targetable indicators in the near infrared that can be used in animals. Here, we describe WHaloCaMP, a modular chemigenetic calcium indicator built from bright dye-ligands and protein sensor domains that can be genetically targeted to specific cell populations. Fluorescence change in WHaloCaMP results from reversible quenching of the bound dye via a strategically placed tryptophan. WHaloCaMP is compatible with rhodamine dye-ligands that fluoresce from green to near-infrared, including several dye-ligands that efficiently label the central nervous system in animals. When bound to a near-infrared dye-ligand, WHaloCaMP1a is more than twice as bright as jGCaMP8s, and shows a 7x increase in fluorescence intensity and a 2.1 ns increase in fluorescence lifetime upon calcium binding. We use WHaloCaMP1a with near-infrared fluorescence emission to image Ca2+ responses in flies and mice, to perform three-color multiplexed functional imaging of hundreds of neurons and astrocytes in zebrafish larvae, and to quantitate calcium concentration using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).\nEvolutionarily conserved fMRI network dynamics in the mouse, macaque, and human brain\nAuthors: Gutierrez-Barragan, D.; Ramirez, J. S. B.; Panzeri, S.; Xu, T.; Gozzi, A.\nScore: 43.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549681\nEvolutionarily relevant networks have been previously described in several mammalian species using time-averaged analyses of fMRI time-series. However, fMRI network activity is highly dynamic and continually evolves over timescales of seconds. Whether the dynamic principles that govern intrinsic fMRI network fluctuations are conserved across mammalian species remains unclear. Using frame-wise clustering of fMRI time-series, we find that fMRI network dynamics in awake macaques and humans is characterized by recurrent transitions between a set of 4 dominant, neuroanatomically homologous fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes), three of which are also plausibly represented in the rodent brain. Importantly, in all species the identified C-modes exhibit species-invariant dynamic features, including intrinsic infraslow dynamics and preferred occurrence at specific phases of global fMRI signal fluctuations. Moreover, C-modes occurrence rates in awake humans, macaques and mice reflect temporal trajectories of least energy and predicts ranking of corresponding functional connectivity gradients. Our results reveal a set of species-invariant principles underlying the dynamic organization of fMRI networks in mammalian species, and offer novel opportunities to relate fMRI network findings across the phylogenetic tree.\nOscillatory waveform shape and temporal spike correlations differ across bat frontal and auditory cortex\nAuthors: Garcia-Rosales, F.; Schaworonkow, N.; Hechavarria, J. C.\nScore: 42.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547519\nNeural oscillations are associated with diverse computations in the mammalian brain. The waveform shape of oscillatory activity measured in cortex relates to local physiology, and can be informative about aberrant or dynamically changing states. However, how waveform shape differs across distant yet functionally and anatomically related cortical regions is largely unknown. In this study, we capitalize on simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the auditory and frontal cortices of awake Carollia perspicillata bats to examine, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, waveform shape differences across cortical regions. We find that waveform shape differs markedly in the fronto-auditory circuit even for rhythmic activity in comparable frequency ranges (i.e. in the delta and gamma bands) during spontaneous activity. In addition, we report consistent differences between areas in the variability of waveform shape across individual cycles. A conceptual model predicts higher spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations in regions with more asymmetric shape, a phenomenon that was observed in the data: spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations were higher in frontal cortex. The model suggests a relationship between waveform shape differences and differences in spike correlations across cortical areas. Altogether, these results indicate that oscillatory activity in frontal and auditory possess distinct dynamics related to the anatomical and functional diversity of the fronto-auditory circuit. Significance statementThe brain activity of many animals displays intricate oscillations, which are usually characterized in terms of their frequency and amplitude. Here, we study oscillations from the bat frontal and auditory cortices on a cycle-by-cycle basis, additionally focusing on their characteristic waveform shape. The study reveals clear differences across regions in waveform shape and oscillatory regularity, even when the frequency of the oscillations is similar. A conceptual model predicts that more asymmetric waveforms result from stronger correlations between neural spikes and electrical field activity. Such predictions were supported by the data. The findings shed light onto the unique properties of different cortical areas, providing key insights into the distinctive physiology and functional diversity within the fronto-auditory circuit.\nCalcium-permeable AMPA receptors govern PV neuron feature selectivity\nAuthors: Hong, I.; Kim, J.; Hainmueller, T.; Kim, D. W.; Johnson, R. C.; Park, S. H.; Limjunyawong, N.; Yang, Z.; Cheon, D.; Hwang, T.; Agarwal, A.; Cholvin, T.; Krienen, F. M.; McCarroll, S. A.; Dong, X.; Leopold, D. A.; Blackshaw, S.; Bergles, D. E.; Bartos, M.; Brown, S. P.; Huganir, R. L.\nScore: 31.9, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549908\nThe brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory cells in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA receptors6,7. While excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors containing the GluA2 subunit, PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find a low expression stoichiometry of GluA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons which is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets, and humans, causing abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Sparse CP-AMPAR manipulations demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur well beyond development. Interestingly, excitatory-PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, suggesting that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without drastically changing connectivity. In GluA2 knockout mice, where all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly reduced orientation selectivity, suggesting that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Remarkably, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, indicating that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a novel role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining a low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and suggest a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes the unique synaptic computations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.\nTutorial on MUedit: An open-source software for identifying and analysing the discharge timing of motor units from electromyographic signals\nAuthors: Avrillon, S.; Hug, F.; Gibbs, C.; Farina, D.\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548568\nWe introduce the open-source software MUedit and we describe its use for identifying the discharge timing of motor units from all types of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded with multi-channel systems. MUedit performs EMG decomposition using a blind-source separation approach. Following this, users can display the estimated motor unit pulse trains and inspect the accuracy of the automatic detection of discharge times. When necessary, users can correct the automatic detection of discharge times and recalculate the motor unit pulse train with an updated separation vector. Here, we provide an open-source software and a tutorial that guides the user through i) the parameters and steps of the decomposition algorithm, and ii) the manual editing of motor unit pulse trains. Further, we provide simulated and experimental EMG signals recorded with grids of surface electrodes and intramuscular electrode arrays to benchmark the performance of MUedit. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of the blind-source separation approach for the study of motor unit behaviour during muscle contractions in humans.\nA Biophysical Model of Visual Rivalry Links Cellular Mechanisms to Signatures of Conscious Perception\nAuthors: Whyte, C. J.; Munn, B. R.; Aru, J.; Larkum, M.; John, Y.; Muller, E. J.; Shine, J. M.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548934\nInvestigations into the neural basis of conscious perception span multiple scales and levels of analysis. There is, however, a theoretical and methodological gap between advances made at the microscopic scale in animal models and those made at the macroscopic scale in human cognitive neuroscience that places a fundamental limit on our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Here, we use computational modelling to bridge this gap. Specifically, we show that the same mechanism that underlies threshold detection in mice - apical dendrite mediated burst firing in thick-tufted layer V pyramidal neurons - determines perceptual dominance in a thalamocortical model of binocular rivalry - a staple task in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. The model conforms to the constraints imposed by decades of previous research into binocular rivalry and generalises to the more sophisticated rivalry tasks studied in humans generating novel, testable, explanations of the role of expectation and attention in rivalry. Our model, therefore, provides an empirically-tractable bridge between cellular-level mechanisms and conscious perception.\nPolyGR and polyPR knock-in mice reveal a conserved neuroprotective extracellular matrix signature in C9orf72 ALS/FTD neurons\nAuthors: Milioto, C.; Carcole, M.; Giblin, A.; Coneys, R.; Attrebi, O.; Ahmed, M.; Harris, S.

A.; Greensmith, L.; Fisher, E. M.; Isaacs, A. M.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549331\nA GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD (C9ALS/FTD). The presence of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, generated by translation of the expanded repeat, is a major pathogenic feature of C9ALS/FTD pathology, but their most relevant effects in a physiological context are not known. Here, we generated C9orf72 DPR knock-in mouse models characterised by physiological expression of 400 codon-optimised polyGR or polyPR repeats, and heterozygous C9orf72 reduction. (GR)400 and (PR)400 knock-in mice exhibit cortical neuronal hyperexcitability, age-dependent spinal motor neuron loss and progressive motor dysfunction, showing that they recapitulate key features of C9FTD/ALS. Quantitative proteomics revealed an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in (GR)400 and (PR)400 spinal cord, with the collagen COL6A1 the most increased protein. This signature of increased ECM proteins was also present in C9ALS patient iPSC-motor neurons indicating it is a conserved feature of C9ALS/FTD. TGF-{beta}1 was one of the top predicted regulators of this ECM signature and polyGR expression in human iPSC-neurons was sufficient to induce TGF-{beta}1 followed by COL6A1, indicating TGF-{beta}1 is one driver of the ECM signature. Knockdown of the TGF-{beta}1 or COL6A1 orthologue in Drosophila dramatically and specifically exacerbated neurodegeneration in polyGR flies, showing that TGF-{beta}1 and COL6A1 protect against polyGR toxicity. Altogether, our physiological C9orf72 DPR knock-in mice have revealed a neuroprotective and conserved ECM signature in C9FTD/ALS.\nScalable projected Light Sheet Microscopy for high-resolution imaging of living and cleared samples\nAuthors: Chen, Y.; Chauhan, S.; Gong, C.; Dayton, H.; Xu, C.; De La Cruz, E. D.; Datta, M. S.; Leong, K. W.; Dietrich, L. E. P.; Tomer, R.\nScore: 48.6, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.543173\nLight sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a widely used imaging technique for living and large cleared samples. However, high-performance LSFM systems are often prohibitively expensive and not easily scalable for high-throughput applications. Here, we introduce a cost-effective, scalable, and versatile high-resolution imaging framework, called projected Light Sheet Microscopy (pLSM), which repurposes readily available off-the-shelf consumer-grade components and an over-the-network control architecture to achieve high-resolution imaging of living and cleared samples. We extensively characterize the pLSM framework and showcase its capabilities through high-resolution, multi-color imaging and quantitative analysis of mouse and post-mortem human brain samples cleared using various techniques. Moreover, we show the applicability of pLSM for high-throughput molecular phenotyping of human induced pluripotent cells (iPSC)-derived brain and vessel organoids. Additionally, we utilized pLSM for comprehensive live imaging of bacterial pellicle biofilms at the air-liquid interface, uncovering their intricate layered architecture and diverse cellular dynamics across different depths. Overall, the pLSM framework has the potential to further democratize LSFM by making high-resolution light sheet microscopy more accessible and scalable.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Consciousness is comprised of arousal (i.e., wakefulness) and awareness. Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 {micro}m resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness.

        <p class="abstract">Episodic memory, or memory of experienced events, is a critical function of the hippocampus1-3. It is therefore important to understand how hippocampal activity represents specific events in an animals life. We addressed this question in chickadees - specialist food-caching birds that hide food at scattered locations and use memory to find their caches later in time4, 5. We performed high-density neural recordings in the hippocampus of chickadees as they cached and retrieved seeds in a laboratory arena. We found that each caching event was represented by a burst of firing in a unique set of hippocampal neurons. These  barcode-like patterns of activity were sparse (&lt;10% of neurons active), uncorrelated even for immediately adjacent caches, and different even for separate caches at the same location. The barcode representing a specific caching event was transiently reactivated whenever a bird later interacted with the same cache - for example, to retrieve food. Barcodes co-occurred with conventional place cell activity6, 7, as well as location-independent responses to cached seeds. We propose that barcodes are signatures of episodic memories evoked during memory recall. These patterns assign a unique identifier to each event and may be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators have revolutionized neuroscience and other biological fields by allowing cellular-resolution recording of physiology during behavior. However, we currently lack bright, genetically targetable indicators in the near infrared that can be used in animals. Here, we describe WHaloCaMP, a modular chemigenetic calcium indicator built from bright dye-ligands and protein sensor domains that can be genetically targeted to specific cell populations. Fluorescence change in WHaloCaMP results from reversible quenching of the bound dye via a strategically placed tryptophan. WHaloCaMP is compatible with rhodamine dye-ligands that fluoresce from green to near-infrared, including several dye-ligands that efficiently label the central nervous system in animals. When bound to a near-infrared dye-ligand, WHaloCaMP1a is more than twice as bright as jGCaMP8s, and shows a 7x increase in fluorescence intensity and a 2.1 ns increase in fluorescence lifetime upon calcium binding. We use WHaloCaMP1a with near-infrared fluorescence emission to image Ca2&#43; responses in flies and mice, to perform three-color multiplexed functional imaging of hundreds of neurons and astrocytes in zebrafish larvae, and to quantitate calcium concentration using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evolutionarily relevant networks have been previously described in several mammalian species using time-averaged analyses of fMRI time-series. However, fMRI network activity is highly dynamic and continually evolves over timescales of seconds. Whether the dynamic principles that govern intrinsic fMRI network fluctuations are conserved across mammalian species remains unclear. Using frame-wise clustering of fMRI time-series, we find that fMRI network dynamics in awake macaques and humans is characterized by recurrent transitions between a set of 4 dominant, neuroanatomically homologous fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes), three of which are also plausibly represented in the rodent brain. Importantly, in all species the identified C-modes exhibit species-invariant dynamic features, including intrinsic infraslow dynamics and preferred occurrence at specific phases of global fMRI signal fluctuations. Moreover, C-modes occurrence rates in awake humans, macaques and mice reflect temporal trajectories of least energy and predicts ranking of corresponding functional connectivity gradients. Our results reveal a set of species-invariant principles underlying the dynamic organization of fMRI networks in mammalian species, and offer novel opportunities to relate fMRI network findings across the phylogenetic tree.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural oscillations are associated with diverse computations in the mammalian brain. The waveform shape of oscillatory activity measured in cortex relates to local physiology, and can be informative about aberrant or dynamically changing states. However, how waveform shape differs across distant yet functionally and anatomically related cortical regions is largely unknown. In this study, we capitalize on simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the auditory and frontal cortices of awake Carollia perspicillata bats to examine, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, waveform shape differences across cortical regions. We find that waveform shape differs markedly in the fronto-auditory circuit even for rhythmic activity in comparable frequency ranges (i.e. in the delta and gamma bands) during spontaneous activity. In addition, we report consistent differences between areas in the variability of waveform shape across individual cycles. A conceptual model predicts higher spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations in regions with more asymmetric shape, a phenomenon that was observed in the data: spike-spike and spike-LFP correlations were higher in frontal cortex. The model suggests a relationship between waveform shape differences and differences in spike correlations across cortical areas. Altogether, these results indicate that oscillatory activity in frontal and auditory possess distinct dynamics related to the anatomical and functional diversity of the fronto-auditory circuit.

Significance statementThe brain activity of many animals displays intricate oscillations, which are usually characterized in terms of their frequency and amplitude. Here, we study oscillations from the bat frontal and auditory cortices on a cycle-by-cycle basis, additionally focusing on their characteristic waveform shape. The study reveals clear differences across regions in waveform shape and oscillatory regularity, even when the frequency of the oscillations is similar. A conceptual model predicts that more asymmetric waveforms result from stronger correlations between neural spikes and electrical field activity. Such predictions were supported by the data. The findings shed light onto the unique properties of different cortical areas, providing key insights into the distinctive physiology and functional diversity within the fronto-auditory circuit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory cells in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA receptors6,7. While excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors containing the GluA2 subunit, PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find a low expression stoichiometry of GluA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons which is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets, and humans, causing abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Sparse CP-AMPAR manipulations demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur well beyond development. Interestingly, excitatory-PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, suggesting that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without drastically changing connectivity. In GluA2 knockout mice, where all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly reduced orientation selectivity, suggesting that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Remarkably, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, indicating that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a novel role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining a low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and suggest a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes the unique synaptic computations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce the open-source software MUedit and we describe its use for identifying the discharge timing of motor units from all types of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded with multi-channel systems. MUedit performs EMG decomposition using a blind-source separation approach. Following this, users can display the estimated motor unit pulse trains and inspect the accuracy of the automatic detection of discharge times. When necessary, users can correct the automatic detection of discharge times and recalculate the motor unit pulse train with an updated separation vector. Here, we provide an open-source software and a tutorial that guides the user through i) the parameters and steps of the decomposition algorithm, and ii) the manual editing of motor unit pulse trains. Further, we provide simulated and experimental EMG signals recorded with grids of surface electrodes and intramuscular electrode arrays to benchmark the performance of MUedit. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of the blind-source separation approach for the study of motor unit behaviour during muscle contractions in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Investigations into the neural basis of conscious perception span multiple scales and levels of analysis. There is, however, a theoretical and methodological gap between advances made at the microscopic scale in animal models and those made at the macroscopic scale in human cognitive neuroscience that places a fundamental limit on our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Here, we use computational modelling to bridge this gap. Specifically, we show that the same mechanism that underlies threshold detection in mice - apical dendrite mediated burst firing in thick-tufted layer V pyramidal neurons - determines perceptual dominance in a thalamocortical model of binocular rivalry - a staple task in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. The model conforms to the constraints imposed by decades of previous research into binocular rivalry and generalises to the more sophisticated rivalry tasks studied in humans generating novel, testable, explanations of the role of expectation and attention in rivalry. Our model, therefore, provides an empirically-tractable bridge between cellular-level mechanisms and conscious perception.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD (C9ALS/FTD). The presence of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, generated by translation of the expanded repeat, is a major pathogenic feature of C9ALS/FTD pathology, but their most relevant effects in a physiological context are not known. Here, we generated C9orf72 DPR knock-in mouse models characterised by physiological expression of 400 codon-optimised polyGR or polyPR repeats, and heterozygous C9orf72 reduction. (GR)400 and (PR)400 knock-in mice exhibit cortical neuronal hyperexcitability, age-dependent spinal motor neuron loss and progressive motor dysfunction, showing that they recapitulate key features of C9FTD/ALS. Quantitative proteomics revealed an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in (GR)400 and (PR)400 spinal cord, with the collagen COL6A1 the most increased protein. This signature of increased ECM proteins was also present in C9ALS patient iPSC-motor neurons indicating it is a conserved feature of C9ALS/FTD. TGF-{beta}1 was one of the top predicted regulators of this ECM signature and polyGR expression in human iPSC-neurons was sufficient to induce TGF-{beta}1 followed by COL6A1, indicating TGF-{beta}1 is one driver of the ECM signature. Knockdown of the TGF-{beta}1 or COL6A1 orthologue in Drosophila dramatically and specifically exacerbated neurodegeneration in polyGR flies, showing that TGF-{beta}1 and COL6A1 protect against polyGR toxicity. Altogether, our physiological C9orf72 DPR knock-in mice have revealed a neuroprotective and conserved ECM signature in C9FTD/ALS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a widely used imaging technique for living and large cleared samples. However, high-performance LSFM systems are often prohibitively expensive and not easily scalable for high-throughput applications. Here, we introduce a cost-effective, scalable, and versatile high-resolution imaging framework, called projected Light Sheet Microscopy (pLSM), which repurposes readily available off-the-shelf consumer-grade components and an over-the-network control architecture to achieve high-resolution imaging of living and cleared samples. We extensively characterize the pLSM framework and showcase its capabilities through high-resolution, multi-color imaging and quantitative analysis of mouse and post-mortem human brain samples cleared using various techniques. Moreover, we show the applicability of pLSM for high-throughput molecular phenotyping of human induced pluripotent cells (iPSC)-derived brain and vessel organoids. Additionally, we utilized pLSM for comprehensive live imaging of bacterial pellicle biofilms at the air-liquid interface, uncovering their intricate layered architecture and diverse cellular dynamics across different depths. Overall, the pLSM framework has the potential to further democratize LSFM by making high-resolution light sheet microscopy more accessible and scalable.</p>
