Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at ultra-high densities (\u003e1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), with 6 {micro}m center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neurons electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves [~]3-fold. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging, we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75% success among three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.\nA general exposome factor explains individual differences in functional brain network topography and cognition in youth\nAuthors: Keller, A.

Despite the long-recognized importance of the environment in shaping individual differences in cognitive neurodevelopment, only with the combination of deep phenotyping approaches and the availability of large-scale datasets have we been able to more comprehensively characterize the many inter-connected features of an individual's environment and experience ('exposome'). Moreover, despite clear evidence that brain organization is highly individualized, most neuroimaging studies still rely on group atlases to define functional networks, smearing away inter-individual variation in the spatial layout of functional networks across the cortex ('functional topography'). Here, we leverage the largest longitudinal study of brain and behavior development in the United States to investigate how an individual's exposome may contribute to functional brain network organization leading to differences in cognitive functioning. To do so, we apply three previously-validated data driven computational models to characterize an individual's multidimensional exposome, define individual-specific maps of functional brain networks, and measure cognitive functioning across broad domains. In pre-registered analyses replicated across matched discovery (n=5,139, 48.5% female) and replication (n=5,137, 47.1% female) samples, we find that a child's exposome is associated with multiple domains of cognitive functioning both at baseline assessment and two years later, over and above associations with baseline cognition. Cross-validated ridge regression models reveal that the exposome is reflected in children's unique patterns of functional topography. Finally, we uncover both shared and unique contributions of the exposome and functional topography to cognitive abilities, finding that models trained on a single variable capturing a child's exposome can more accurately and parsimoniously predict future cognitive performance than models trained on a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data. This study advances our understanding of how childhood environments contribute to unique patterns of functional brain organization and variability in cognitive abilities.\nD--hydroxybutyrate stabilizes the hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit during acute insulin resistance.\nAuthors: Kula, B.; Antal, B.; Weistuch, C.; Gackiere, F.; Barre, A.; Velado, V.; Hubbard, J. M.; Kukley, M.; Mujica-Parodi, L. R.; Smith, N. A.\nScore: 33.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554428\nThe brain primarily relies on glycolysis for mitochondrial respiration but switches to alternative fuels such as ketone bodies (KB) during low glucose availability. Neuronal KB uptake, which does not rely on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and insulin, has shown promising clinical applications in alleviating the neurological and cognitive effects of disorders with hypometabolic components. However, the specific mechanisms by which such interventions affect neuronal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we pharmacologically blocked GLUT4 to investigate the effects of the exogenous KB D-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (D-{beta}Hb) on mouse brain metabolism during acute insulin resistance (AIR). We found the impacts of AIR and D-{beta}Hb to be qualitatively distinct across neuronal compartments: AIR decreased synaptic activity and LTP, and impaired axonal conduction, synchronization, and action potential (AP) properties. D-{beta}Hb rescued neuronal functions connected to axonal conduction and synchronization but did not rescue synaptic activity. While D-{beta}HB failed to rescue synaptic activity, it successfully rescued neuronal functions associated with axonal conduction and synchronization. Teaser: D-{beta}Hb reverses detrimental effects of acute insulin resistance in the hippocampus, with distinct effects on soma, dendrites, and axons.\nUsing network control theory to study the dynamics of the structural connectome\nAuthors: Parkes, L.; Kim, J.

S.\nScore: 31.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554519\nNetwork control theory (NCT) is a simple and powerful tool for studying how network topology informs and constrains dynamics. Compared to other structure-function coupling approaches, the strength of NCT lies in its capacity to predict the patterns of external control signals that may alter dynamics in a desired way. We have extensively developed and validated the application of NCT to the human structural connectome. Through these efforts, we have studied (i) how different aspects of connectome topology affect neural dynamics, (ii) whether NCT outputs cohere with empirical data on brain function and stimulation, and (iii) how NCT outputs vary across development and correlate with behavior and mental health symptoms. In this protocol, we introduce a framework for applying NCT to structural connectomes following two main pathways. Our primary pathway focuses on computing the control energy associated with transitioning between specific neural activity states. Our second pathway focuses on computing average controllability, which indexes nodes general capacity to control dynamics. We also provide recommendations for comparing NCT outputs against null network models. Finally, we support this protocol with a Python-based software package called network control theory for python (nctpy).\nSeparating cognitive and motor processes in the behaving mouse\nAuthors: Hasnain, M. A.; Birnbaum, J. E.; Nunez, J. L. U.; Hartman, E.; Chandrasekaran, C.; Economo, M. N.\nScore: 30.3, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554474\nThe cognitive processes supporting complex animal behavior are closely associated with ubiquitous movements responsible for our posture, facial expressions, ability to actively sample our sensory environments, and other central processes. These movements are strongly related to neural activity across much of the brain, making it challenging to dissociate the neural dynamics that support cognitive processes from those supporting movements when they are highly correlated in time. Of critical importance is whether the dynamics supporting cognitive processes and related movements are separable, or if they are both driven by common neural mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate how the separability of cognitive and motor processes can be assessed, and, when separable, how each component can be isolated. We establish a novel two-context behavioral task in mice that involves multiple cognitive processes and show that commonly observed dynamics taken to support cognitive processes are strongly contaminated by movements. When cognitive and motor components are isolated using our analytical approach, we find that they exhibit distinct dynamical trajectories. Further, properly accounting for movement revealed that separate populations of cells encode cognitive and motor variables, in contrast to the mixed selectivity reported by prior work. Accurately isolating the dynamics associated with particular cognitive and motor processes will be essential for developing conceptual and computational models of neural circuit function and evaluating the function of the cell types of which neural circuits are composed.\nRegional Differences in Progenitor Consumption Dynamics Shape Brain Growth during Development\nAuthors: Baumann, N.; Wagener, R.; Javed, A.; Abe, P.; Lopes, A.; Lavalley, A.; Fuciec, D.; Magrinelli, E.; Fievre, S.; Jabaudon, D.\nScore: 29.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553891\nDeveloping mammalian brains are characterized by disproportionate growth of the forebrain compared to other regions. How this localized expansion occurs is, however, largely unknown. To address this, we identified region-specific neurogenic patterns by creating a single-cell-resolution birthdate atlas of the mouse brain (https://www.neurobirth.org). We report that in forebrain regions, neurogenesis is sustained compared to the hindbrain, where neurogenesis is transient and limited to early brain development. Sustained forebrain neurogenesis reflects lengthened cell cycle and reduced consumptive divisions of ventricular zone progenitors, resulting in a preserved germinal cell pool. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify functional molecular programs of ventricular zone progenitors that spatially and temporally regulate progenitor cycling properties, including through loss-of-function of the forebrain-enriched mitochondrial membrane protein Fam210b. These results reveal a parsimonious mechanism to locally regulate neuronal production, in which the time window during which progenitors generate cells is a critical determinant of region-specific brain expansion.\nMultiplexing cortical brain organoids for the longitudinal dissection of developmental traits at single cell resolution\nAuthors: Caporale, N.; Castaldi, D.; Rigoli, M. T.; Cheroni, C.; Trattaro, S.; Valenti, A.; Bonfanti, M.; Stucchi, S.; Tobon, A. L.; Ricca, D.; Lessi, M.; Pezzali, M.; Vitriolo, A.; Schmid, K.; Heinig, M.; Theis, F. J.; Villa, C. E.; Testa, G.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553507\nThe combination of brain organoid and single cell omic technologies holds transformative potential to dissect human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision. Delivering this promise in the context of human neurodiversity, physiological and pathological alike, requires however a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we implemented and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids. Following an extended longitudinal design with a uniquely informative set of timepoints, we pooled cells from different induced pluripotent stem cell lines either during organoids generation (upstream multiplexing in mosaic models) or before single cell-RNAseq library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We developed a new method, SCanSNP, and an aggregated call to deconvolve organoids cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets prediction and low quality cells identification and improving accuracy over state of the art algorithms. Integrating single cell transcriptomes and analysing cell types across neurodevelopmental stages and multiplexing modalities, we validated the feasibility of both multiplexing methods in charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, linking their specificity to genetic variation between individual lines. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides an enabling resource for disease modelling at scale and paves the way towards an in vitro epidemiology paradigm.\nComparative neuroimaging of sex differences in human and mouse brain anatomy\nAuthors: Guma, E.; Beauchamp, A.; Liu, S.; Levitis, E.; Ellegood, J.; Pham, L.; Mars, R. B.; Raznahan, A.; Lerch, J. P.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554334\nIn vivo neuroimaging studies have established several reproducible volumetric sex differences in the human brain, but the causes of such differences are hard to parse. While mouse models are useful for understanding the cellular and mechanistic bases of sex-biased brain development in mammals, there have been no attempts to formally compare mouse and human sex differences across the whole brain to ascertain how well they translate. Addressing this question would shed critical light on use of the mouse as a translational model for sex differences in the human brain and provide insights into the degree to which sex differences in brain volume are conserved across mammals. Here, we use cross-species structural magnetic resonance imaging to carry out the first comparative neuroimaging study of sex-biased neuroanatomical organization of the human and mouse brain. In line with previous findings, we observe that in humans, males have significantly larger and more variable total brain volume; these sex differences are not mirrored in mice. After controlling for total brain volume, we observe modest cross-species congruence in the volumetric effect size of sex across 60 homologous brain regions (r=0.30; e.g.: M\u003eF amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hypothalamus and F\u003eM anterior cingulate, somatosensory, and primary auditory cortices). This cross-species congruence is greater in the cortex (r=0.33) than non-cortex (r=0.16). By incorporating regional measures of gene expression in both species, we reveal that cortical regions with greater cross-species congruence in volumetric sex differences also show greater cross-species congruence in the expression profile of 2835 homologous genes. This phenomenon differentiates primary sensory regions with high congruence of sex effects and gene expression from limbic cortices where congruence in both these features was weaker between species. These findings help identify aspects of sex-biased brain anatomy present in mice that are retained, lost, or inverted in humans. More broadly, our work provides an empirical basis for targeting mechanistic studies of sex-biased brain development in mice to brain regions that best echo sex-biased brain development in humans.\nBrain-Derived CCN3 Is An Osteoanabolic Hormone That Sustains Bone in Lactating Females\nAuthors: Babey, M. E.; Krause, W. C.; Herber, C. B.; Chen, K.; Nikkannen, J.; Rodriquez, R.; Zhang, X.; Castro-Navarro, F.; Wang, Y.; Villeda, S.; Lane, N. E.; Scheller, E. L.; Chan, C. K. F.; Ambrosi, T. H.; Ingraham, H. A.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554707\nIn lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2+) demand for milk production triggers significant bone resorption. While estrogen would normally counteract excessive bone loss and maintain sufficient bone formation during this postpartum period, this sex steroid drops precipitously after giving birth. Here, we report that brain-derived CCN3 (Cellular Communication Network factor 3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. Using parabiosis and bone transplant methods, we first established that a humoral factor accounts for the female-specific, high bone mass previously observed by our group after deleting estrogen receptor alpha (ER) from ARCKISS1 neurons1. This exceptional bone phenotype in mutant females can be traced back to skeletal stem cells (SSCs), as reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from ARCKISS1 neurons, acting on mouse and human SSCs at low subnanomolar concentrations independent of age or sex. That brain-derived CCN3 promotes bone formation was further confirmed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies. Notably, a transient rise in CCN3 appears in ARCKISS1 neurons in estrogen-depleted lactating females coincident with increased bone remodeling and high calcium demand. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone that defines a novel female-specific brain-bone axis for ensuring mammalian species survival.\nMesoscale functional architecture in medial posterior parietal cortex\nAuthors: Hira, R.; Townsend, L. B.; Smith, I. T.; Yu, C.-H.; Stirman, J. N.; Yu, Y.; Smith, S. L.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.555017\nThe posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in mice has various functions including multisensory integration, vision-guided behaviors, working memory, and posture control. However, an integrated understanding of these functions and their cortical localizations in and around the PPC and higher visual areas (HVAs), has not been completely elucidated. Here we simultaneously imaged the activity of thousands of neurons within a 3 mm x 3 mm field-of-view, including eight cortical areas around the PPC, during behavior. Mice performed both a vision-guided task and a choice history-dependent task, and the imaging results revealed distinct, localized, behavior-related functions of two medial PPC areas. Neurons in the anteromedial (AM) HVA responded to both vision and choice information, and thus AM is a locus of association between these channels. By contrast, the anterior (A) HVA stores choice history with rotational dynamics and represents posture. Mesoscale correlation analysis on the intertrial variability of neuronal activity demonstrated that neurons in area A shared fluctuations with S1t (trunk primary somatosensory area), while neurons in AM exhibited diverse, area-dependent interactions. Pairwise interarea interactions among neurons were precisely predicted by the anatomical input correlations, with the exception of some global interactions. Thus, the medial PPC has two distinct modules, areas A and AM, which each have distinctive modes of cortical communication. These medial PPC modules can serve separate higher-order functions: area A for transmission of information including posture, movement, and working memory; and area AM for multisensory and cognitive integration with locally processed signals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To study the neural basis of behavior, we require methods to sensitively and accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at ultra-high densities (&gt;1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), with 6 {micro}m center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neurons electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves [~]3-fold. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging, we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75% success among three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our minds and brains are highly unique. Despite the long-recognized importance of the environment in shaping individual differences in cognitive neurodevelopment, only with the combination of deep phenotyping approaches and the availability of large-scale datasets have we been able to more comprehensively characterize the many inter-connected features of an individual&#39;s environment and experience (&#39;exposome&#39;). Moreover, despite clear evidence that brain organization is highly individualized, most neuroimaging studies still rely on group atlases to define functional networks, smearing away inter-individual variation in the spatial layout of functional networks across the cortex (&#39;functional topography&#39;). Here, we leverage the largest longitudinal study of brain and behavior development in the United States to investigate how an individual&#39;s exposome may contribute to functional brain network organization leading to differences in cognitive functioning. To do so, we apply three previously-validated data driven computational models to characterize an individual&#39;s multidimensional exposome, define individual-specific maps of functional brain networks, and measure cognitive functioning across broad domains. In pre-registered analyses replicated across matched discovery (n=5,139, 48.5% female) and replication (n=5,137, 47.1% female) samples, we find that a child&#39;s exposome is associated with multiple domains of cognitive functioning both at baseline assessment and two years later, over and above associations with baseline cognition. Cross-validated ridge regression models reveal that the exposome is reflected in children&#39;s unique patterns of functional topography. Finally, we uncover both shared and unique contributions of the exposome and functional topography to cognitive abilities, finding that models trained on a single variable capturing a child&#39;s exposome can more accurately and parsimoniously predict future cognitive performance than models trained on a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data. This study advances our understanding of how childhood environments contribute to unique patterns of functional brain organization and variability in cognitive abilities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The brain primarily relies on glycolysis for mitochondrial respiration but switches to alternative fuels such as ketone bodies (KB) during low glucose availability. Neuronal KB uptake, which does not rely on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and insulin, has shown promising clinical applications in alleviating the neurological and cognitive effects of disorders with hypometabolic components. However, the specific mechanisms by which such interventions affect neuronal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we pharmacologically blocked GLUT4 to investigate the effects of the exogenous KB D-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (D-{beta}Hb) on mouse brain metabolism during acute insulin resistance (AIR). We found the impacts of AIR and D-{beta}Hb to be qualitatively distinct across neuronal compartments: AIR decreased synaptic activity and LTP, and impaired axonal conduction, synchronization, and action potential (AP) properties. D-{beta}Hb rescued neuronal functions connected to axonal conduction and synchronization but did not rescue synaptic activity. While D-{beta}HB failed to rescue synaptic activity, it successfully rescued neuronal functions associated with axonal conduction and synchronization.

Teaser: D-{beta}Hb reverses detrimental effects of acute insulin resistance in the hippocampus, with distinct effects on soma, dendrites, and axons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Network control theory (NCT) is a simple and powerful tool for studying how network topology informs and constrains dynamics. Compared to other structure-function coupling approaches, the strength of NCT lies in its capacity to predict the patterns of external control signals that may alter dynamics in a desired way. We have extensively developed and validated the application of NCT to the human structural connectome. Through these efforts, we have studied (i) how different aspects of connectome topology affect neural dynamics, (ii) whether NCT outputs cohere with empirical data on brain function and stimulation, and (iii) how NCT outputs vary across development and correlate with behavior and mental health symptoms. In this protocol, we introduce a framework for applying NCT to structural connectomes following two main pathways. Our primary pathway focuses on computing the control energy associated with transitioning between specific neural activity states. Our second pathway focuses on computing average controllability, which indexes nodes general capacity to control dynamics. We also provide recommendations for comparing NCT outputs against null network models. Finally, we support this protocol with a Python-based software package called network control theory for python (nctpy).</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cognitive processes supporting complex animal behavior are closely associated with ubiquitous movements responsible for our posture, facial expressions, ability to actively sample our sensory environments, and other central processes. These movements are strongly related to neural activity across much of the brain, making it challenging to dissociate the neural dynamics that support cognitive processes from those supporting movements when they are highly correlated in time. Of critical importance is whether the dynamics supporting cognitive processes and related movements are separable, or if they are both driven by common neural mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate how the separability of cognitive and motor processes can be assessed, and, when separable, how each component can be isolated. We establish a novel two-context behavioral task in mice that involves multiple cognitive processes and show that commonly observed dynamics taken to support cognitive processes are strongly contaminated by movements. When cognitive and motor components are isolated using our analytical approach, we find that they exhibit distinct dynamical trajectories. Further, properly accounting for movement revealed that separate populations of cells encode cognitive and motor variables, in contrast to the  mixed selectivity reported by prior work. Accurately isolating the dynamics associated with particular cognitive and motor processes will be essential for developing conceptual and computational models of neural circuit function and evaluating the function of the cell types of which neural circuits are composed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developing mammalian brains are characterized by disproportionate growth of the forebrain compared to other regions. How this localized expansion occurs is, however, largely unknown. To address this, we identified region-specific neurogenic patterns by creating a single-cell-resolution birthdate atlas of the mouse brain (https://www.neurobirth.org). We report that in forebrain regions, neurogenesis is sustained compared to the hindbrain, where neurogenesis is transient and limited to early brain development. Sustained forebrain neurogenesis reflects lengthened cell cycle and reduced consumptive divisions of ventricular zone progenitors, resulting in a preserved germinal cell pool. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify functional molecular programs of ventricular zone progenitors that spatially and temporally regulate progenitor cycling properties, including through loss-of-function of the forebrain-enriched mitochondrial membrane protein Fam210b. These results reveal a parsimonious mechanism to locally regulate neuronal production, in which the time window during which progenitors generate cells is a critical determinant of region-specific brain expansion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The combination of brain organoid and single cell omic technologies holds transformative potential to dissect human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision. Delivering this promise in the context of human neurodiversity, physiological and pathological alike, requires however a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we implemented and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids. Following an extended longitudinal design with a uniquely informative set of timepoints, we pooled cells from different induced pluripotent stem cell lines either during organoids generation (upstream multiplexing in mosaic models) or before single cell-RNAseq library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We developed a new method, SCanSNP, and an aggregated call to deconvolve organoids cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets prediction and low quality cells identification and improving accuracy over state of the art algorithms. Integrating single cell transcriptomes and analysing cell types across neurodevelopmental stages and multiplexing modalities, we validated the feasibility of both multiplexing methods in charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, linking their specificity to genetic variation between individual lines. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides an enabling resource for disease modelling at scale and paves the way towards an in vitro epidemiology paradigm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vivo neuroimaging studies have established several reproducible volumetric sex differences in the human brain, but the causes of such differences are hard to parse. While mouse models are useful for understanding the cellular and mechanistic bases of sex-biased brain development in mammals, there have been no attempts to formally compare mouse and human sex differences across the whole brain to ascertain how well they translate. Addressing this question would shed critical light on use of the mouse as a translational model for sex differences in the human brain and provide insights into the degree to which sex differences in brain volume are conserved across mammals. Here, we use cross-species structural magnetic resonance imaging to carry out the first comparative neuroimaging study of sex-biased neuroanatomical organization of the human and mouse brain. In line with previous findings, we observe that in humans, males have significantly larger and more variable total brain volume; these sex differences are not mirrored in mice. After controlling for total brain volume, we observe modest cross-species congruence in the volumetric effect size of sex across 60 homologous brain regions (r=0.30; e.g.: M&gt;F amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hypothalamus and F&gt;M anterior cingulate, somatosensory, and primary auditory cortices). This cross-species congruence is greater in the cortex (r=0.33) than non-cortex (r=0.16). By incorporating regional measures of gene expression in both species, we reveal that cortical regions with greater cross-species congruence in volumetric sex differences also show greater cross-species congruence in the expression profile of 2835 homologous genes. This phenomenon differentiates primary sensory regions with high congruence of sex effects and gene expression from limbic cortices where congruence in both these features was weaker between species. These findings help identify aspects of sex-biased brain anatomy present in mice that are retained, lost, or inverted in humans. More broadly, our work provides an empirical basis for targeting mechanistic studies of sex-biased brain development in mice to brain regions that best echo sex-biased brain development in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2&#43;) demand for milk production triggers significant bone resorption. While estrogen would normally counteract excessive bone loss and maintain sufficient bone formation during this postpartum period, this sex steroid drops precipitously after giving birth. Here, we report that brain-derived CCN3 (Cellular Communication Network factor 3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. Using parabiosis and bone transplant methods, we first established that a humoral factor accounts for the female-specific, high bone mass previously observed by our group after deleting estrogen receptor alpha (ER) from ARCKISS1 neurons1. This exceptional bone phenotype in mutant females can be traced back to skeletal stem cells (SSCs), as reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from ARCKISS1 neurons, acting on mouse and human SSCs at low subnanomolar concentrations independent of age or sex. That brain-derived CCN3 promotes bone formation was further confirmed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies. Notably, a transient rise in CCN3 appears in ARCKISS1 neurons in estrogen-depleted lactating females coincident with increased bone remodeling and high calcium demand. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone that defines a novel female-specific brain-bone axis for ensuring mammalian species survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in mice has various functions including multisensory integration, vision-guided behaviors, working memory, and posture control. However, an integrated understanding of these functions and their cortical localizations in and around the PPC and higher visual areas (HVAs), has not been completely elucidated. Here we simultaneously imaged the activity of thousands of neurons within a 3 mm x 3 mm field-of-view, including eight cortical areas around the PPC, during behavior. Mice performed both a vision-guided task and a choice history-dependent task, and the imaging results revealed distinct, localized, behavior-related functions of two medial PPC areas. Neurons in the anteromedial (AM) HVA responded to both vision and choice information, and thus AM is a locus of association between these channels. By contrast, the anterior (A) HVA stores choice history with rotational dynamics and represents posture. Mesoscale correlation analysis on the intertrial variability of neuronal activity demonstrated that neurons in area A shared fluctuations with S1t (trunk primary somatosensory area), while neurons in AM exhibited diverse, area-dependent interactions. Pairwise interarea interactions among neurons were precisely predicted by the anatomical input correlations, with the exception of some global interactions. Thus, the medial PPC has two distinct modules, areas A and AM, which each have distinctive modes of cortical communication. These medial PPC modules can serve separate higher-order functions: area A for transmission of information including posture, movement, and working memory; and area AM for multisensory and cognitive integration with locally processed signals.</p>
