F.\nScore: 51.4, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573730\nThe red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N [~] 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity. Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a motor structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.\nMitochondrial reverse electron transport in myeloid cells perpetuates neuroinflammation\nAuthors: Peruzzotti-Jametti, L.; Willis, C.

C.; D'Alessandro, A.; Takats, Z.; Murphy, M. P.; Pluchino, S.\nScore: 50.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574059\nSustained smouldering, or low grade, activation of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS)1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate neuroinflammation is currently unknown. Using a multiomics approach, we identified a new molecular signature that perpetuates the activation of myeloid cells through mitochondrial complex II (CII) and I (CI) activity driving reverse electron transport (RET) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking RET in pro-inflammatory myeloid cells protected the central nervous system (CNS) against neurotoxic damage and improved functional outcomes in animal disease models in vivo. Our data show that RET in myeloid cells is a potential new therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in smouldering inflammatory CNS disorders3.\nThe Neuron as a Direct Data-Driven Controller\nAuthors: Moore, J.; Genkin, A.; Tournoy, M.; Pughe-Sanford, J.; de Ruyter van Steveninck, R. R.; Chklovskii, D. B.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573843\nIn the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a promising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal physiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons, especially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their environment towards a specific desired state through their output. This environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control (DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control. Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the brain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional, feedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a novel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural networks.\nPrinciples of visual cortex excitatory microcircuit organization\nAuthors: Chou, C. Y. C.; Wong, H. H.-W.; Guo, C.; Boukoulou, K. E.; Huang, C.; Jannat, J.; Klimenko, T.; Li, V. Y.; Liang, T. A.; Wu, V. C.; Sjöström, P. J.\nScore: 31.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573666\nMicrocircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

J.; Mohebi, A.; Berke, J. D.; Sabatini, B. L.; Tritsch, N. X.\nScore: 73.7, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573485\nAcetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.\nAn opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning\nAuthors: Lowet, A. S.; Zheng, Q.; Meng, M.; Matias, S.; Drugowitsch, J.; Uchida, N.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573966\nMachine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards -- an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2,3, but little is known about whether, where, and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions4. To fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to acutely record striatal activity from well-trained, water-restricted mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance, and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Remarkably, chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons -- D1 and D2 MSNs -- contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 MSNs5-15 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.\nBasolateral amygdala population coding of a cued reward seeking state depends on orbitofrontal cortex\nAuthors: Ottenheimer, D. J.; Vitale, K. R.; Ambroggi, F.; Janak, P. H.; Saunders, B. T.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573789\nBasolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely linked to the expression of conditioned behavior. An area of increasing interest is how the dynamics of BLA neurons relate to evolving behavior. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking and employed population-level analyses to assess ongoing neural dynamics. We found that, with training, sustained cue-evoked activity emerged that discriminated between the CS+ and CS-and correlated with conditioned responding. This sustained population activity continued until reward receipt and rapidly extinguished along with conditioned behavior during extinction. To assess the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to BLA, to this component of BLA neural activity, we inactivated OFC while recording in BLA and found blunted sustained cue-evoked activity in BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data suggest that sustained cue-driven activity in BLA, which in part depends on OFC input, underlies conditioned reward-seek-ing states.\nA targeted CRISPR-Cas9 mediated F0 screen identifies genes involved in establishment of the enteric nervous system\nAuthors: Moreno-Campos, R.; Singleton, E. W.; Uribe, R. A.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573581\nThe vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) is a crucial network of enteric neurons and glia resident within the entire gastrointestinal tract (GI). Overseeing essential GI functions such as gut motility and water balance, the ENS serves as a pivotal bidirectional link in the gut-brain axis. During early development, the ENS is primarily derived from enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Disruptions to ENCC development, as seen in conditions like Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), lead to absence of ENS in the GI, particularly in the colon. In this study, using zebrafish, we devised an in vivo F0 CRISPR-based screen employing a robust, rapid pipeline integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR reverse genetics, and high-content imaging. Our findings unveil various genes, including those encoding for opioid receptors, as possible regulators of ENS establishment. In addition, we present evidence that suggests opioid receptor involvement in neurochemical coding of the larval ENS. In summary, our work presents a novel, efficient CRISPR screen targeting ENS development, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown genes, and increasing knowledge of nervous system construction.\nKetamine modulates a norepinephrine-astroglial circuit to persistently suppress futility-induced passivity\nAuthors: Duque, M.; Chen, A.

B.\nScore: 37.1, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.29.522099\nAbstractMood-altering compounds hold promise for the treatment of many psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but connecting their molecular, circuit, and behavioral effects has been challenging. Here we find that, analogous to effects in rodent learned helplessness models, ketamine pre-exposure persistently suppresses futility-induced passivity in larval zebrafish. While antidepressants are thought to primarily act on neurons, brain-wide imaging in behaving zebrafish showed that ketamine elevates intracellular calcium in astroglia for many minutes, followed by persistent calcium downregulation post-washout. Calcium elevation depends on astroglial 1-adrenergic receptors and is required for suppression of passivity. Chemo-/optogenetic perturbations of noradrenergic neurons and astroglia demonstrate that the aftereffects of glial calcium elevation are sufficient to suppress passivity by inhibiting neuronal-astroglial integration of behavioral futility. Imaging in mouse cortex reveals that ketamine elevates astroglial calcium through conserved pathways, suggesting that ketamine exerts its behavioral effects by persistently modulating evolutionarily ancient neuromodulatory systems spanning neurons and astroglia.\nEpigenetic Modulation to perturb the SYNGAP1 Intellectual Disability (ID) that ameliorates synaptic and behavioural deficits\nAuthors: Singh, A. K.; Joshi, I.; Reddy, N. M. N.; Purushotham, S. S.; Eswaramoorth, M.; Vasudevan, M.; Banerjee, S.; Clement, J. P.; Kundu, T. K.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574003\nSporadic heterozygous mutations in SYNGAP1 affects social and emotional behaviour that are often observed in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although neurophysiological deficits have been extensively studied, the epigenetic landscape of SYNGAP1 mutation-mediated intellectual disability is unexplored. Here, we have surprisingly found that the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones are significantly repressed in the adolescent hippocampus of Syngap1+/- mouse. To establish the causal relationship of Syngap1+/- phenotype and the altered histone acetylation signature we have treated 2-4 months old Syngap1+/- mouse with glucose-derived carbon nanosphere (CSP) conjugated potent small molecule activator (TTK21) of p300/CBP lysine acetyltransferase (CSP-TTK21). The enhancement of the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones by CSP-TTK21 restored deficits in spine density, synaptic function, and social preferences of Syngap1+/- mouse that is very closely comparable to wild type littermates. The hippocampal RNA-Seq analysis of the treated mice revealed that the expression of many critical genes related to the ID/ASD reversed due to the treatment of the specific small molecule activator. This study could be the first demonstration of the reversal of autistic behaviour and neural wiring upon the modulation of altered epigenetic modification (s).\n",

        <p class="abstract">The red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N [~] 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity.

Notably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a  motor structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sustained smouldering, or low grade, activation of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS)1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate neuroinflammation is currently unknown. Using a multiomics approach, we identified a new molecular signature that perpetuates the activation of myeloid cells through mitochondrial complex II (CII) and I (CI) activity driving reverse electron transport (RET) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking RET in pro-inflammatory myeloid cells protected the central nervous system (CNS) against neurotoxic damage and improved functional outcomes in animal disease models in vivo. Our data show that RET in myeloid cells is a potential new therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in smouldering inflammatory CNS disorders3.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a promising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal physiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons, especially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their environment towards a specific desired state through their output. This environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control (DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control. Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the brain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional, feedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a novel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microcircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.

        <p class="abstract">Acetylcholine is widely believed to modulate the release of dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023) reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1 should be interpreted with caution when combined with optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not observe large acetylcholine-evoked dopamine transients in vivo, the conditions under which such release occurs in behaving animals remain unknown.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards -- an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2,3, but little is known about whether, where, and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions4. To fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to acutely record striatal activity from well-trained, water-restricted mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance, and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Remarkably, chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons -- D1 and D2 MSNs -- contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 MSNs5-15 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely linked to the expression of conditioned behavior. An area of increasing interest is how the dynamics of BLA neurons relate to evolving behavior. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking and employed population-level analyses to assess ongoing neural dynamics. We found that, with training, sustained cue-evoked activity emerged that discriminated between the CS&#43; and CS-and correlated with conditioned responding. This sustained population activity continued until reward receipt and rapidly extinguished along with conditioned behavior during extinction. To assess the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to BLA, to this component of BLA neural activity, we inactivated OFC while recording in BLA and found blunted sustained cue-evoked activity in BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data suggest that sustained cue-driven activity in BLA, which in part depends on OFC input, underlies conditioned reward-seek-ing states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) is a crucial network of enteric neurons and glia resident within the entire gastrointestinal tract (GI). Overseeing essential GI functions such as gut motility and water balance, the ENS serves as a pivotal bidirectional link in the gut-brain axis. During early development, the ENS is primarily derived from enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Disruptions to ENCC development, as seen in conditions like Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), lead to absence of ENS in the GI, particularly in the colon. In this study, using zebrafish, we devised an in vivo F0 CRISPR-based screen employing a robust, rapid pipeline integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR reverse genetics, and high-content imaging. Our findings unveil various genes, including those encoding for opioid receptors, as possible regulators of ENS establishment. In addition, we present evidence that suggests opioid receptor involvement in neurochemical coding of the larval ENS. In summary, our work presents a novel, efficient CRISPR screen targeting ENS development, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown genes, and increasing knowledge of nervous system construction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractMood-altering compounds hold promise for the treatment of many psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but connecting their molecular, circuit, and behavioral effects has been challenging. Here we find that, analogous to effects in rodent learned helplessness models, ketamine pre-exposure persistently suppresses futility-induced passivity in larval zebrafish. While antidepressants are thought to primarily act on neurons, brain-wide imaging in behaving zebrafish showed that ketamine elevates intracellular calcium in astroglia for many minutes, followed by persistent calcium downregulation post-washout. Calcium elevation depends on astroglial 1-adrenergic receptors and is required for suppression of passivity. Chemo-/optogenetic perturbations of noradrenergic neurons and astroglia demonstrate that the aftereffects of glial calcium elevation are sufficient to suppress passivity by inhibiting neuronal-astroglial integration of behavioral futility. Imaging in mouse cortex reveals that ketamine elevates astroglial calcium through conserved pathways, suggesting that ketamine exerts its behavioral effects by persistently modulating evolutionarily ancient neuromodulatory systems spanning neurons and astroglia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sporadic heterozygous mutations in SYNGAP1 affects social and emotional behaviour that are often observed in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although neurophysiological deficits have been extensively studied, the epigenetic landscape of SYNGAP1 mutation-mediated intellectual disability is unexplored. Here, we have surprisingly found that the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones are significantly repressed in the adolescent hippocampus of Syngap1&#43;/- mouse. To establish the causal relationship of Syngap1&#43;/- phenotype and the altered histone acetylation signature we have treated 2-4 months old Syngap1&#43;/- mouse with glucose-derived carbon nanosphere (CSP) conjugated potent small molecule activator (TTK21) of p300/CBP lysine acetyltransferase (CSP-TTK21). The enhancement of the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones by CSP-TTK21 restored deficits in spine density, synaptic function, and social preferences of Syngap1&#43;/- mouse that is very closely comparable to wild type littermates. The hippocampal RNA-Seq analysis of the treated mice revealed that the expression of many critical genes related to the ID/ASD reversed due to the treatment of the specific small molecule activator. This study could be the first demonstration of the reversal of autistic behaviour and neural wiring upon the modulation of altered epigenetic modification (s).</p>
