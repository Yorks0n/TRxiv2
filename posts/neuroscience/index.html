In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x10^7 chemical synapses between ~130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.\nA consensus cell type atlas from multiple connectomes reveals principles of circuit stereotypy and variation\nAuthors: Schlegel, P.; Yin, Y.; Bates, A.

E.\nScore: 645.1, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546055\nThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the \"hemibrain\" connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing \u003e1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.\nAn adversarial collaboration to critically evaluate theories of consciousness\nAuthors: Cogitate Consortium, ; Ferrante, O.; Gorska-Klimowska, U.; Henin, S.; Hirschhorn, R.; Khalaf, A.; Lepauvre, A.; Liu, L.; Richter, D.; Vidal, Y.; Bonacchi, N.; Brown, T.; Sripad, P.; Armendariz, M.; Bendtz, K.; Ghafari, T.; Hetenyi, D.; Jeschke, J.; Kozma, C.; Mazumder, D.

These theories have independently accrued evidence, yet, confirmation bias and dependence on design choices hamper progress in the field. Here, we present an open science adversarial collaboration which directly juxtaposes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), employing a theory-neutral consortium approach. We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex. Beyond challenging the theories themselves, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through a principled, theory-driven, collaborative effort. We highlight the challenges to change people's mind and the need for a quantitative framework integrating evidence for systematic theory testing and building.\nA shared linguistic space for transmitting our thoughts from brain to brain in natural conversations\nAuthors: Zada, Z.; Goldstein, A. Y.; Michelmann, S.; Simony, E.; Price, A.; Hasenfratz, L.; Barham, E.; Zadbood, A.; Doyle, W.; Friedman, D.; Dugan, P.; Melloni, L.; Devore, S.; Flinker, A.; Devinsky, O.; Nastase, S. A.; Hasson, U.\nScore: 54.7, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546708\nEffective communication hinges on a mutual understanding of word meaning in different contexts. The embedding space learned by large language models can serve as an explicit model of the shared, context-rich meaning space humans use to communicate their thoughts. We recorded brain activity using electrocorticography during spontaneous, face-to-face conversations in five pairs of epilepsy patients. We demonstrate that the linguistic embedding space can capture the linguistic content of word-by-word neural alignment between speaker and listener. Linguistic content emerged in the speaker's brain before word articulation, and the same linguistic content rapidly reemerged in the listener's brain after word articulation. These findings establish a computational framework to study how human brains transmit their thoughts to one another in real-world contexts.\nA weighted generative model of the human connectome\nAuthors: Akarca, D.; Schiavi, S.; Achterberg, J.; Genc, S.; Jones, D.; Astle, D.\nScore: 47.9, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546237\nProbabilistic generative network models have offered an exciting window into the constraints governing the human connectomes organization. In particular, they have highlighted the economic context of network formation and the special roles that physical geometry and self-similarity likely play in determining the connectomes topology. However, a critical limitation of these models is that they do not consider the strength of anatomical connectivity between regions. This significantly limits their scope to answer neurobiological questions. The current work draws inspiration from the principle of redundancy reduction to develop a novel weighted generative network model. This weighted generative network model is a significant advance because it not only incorporates the theoretical advancements of previous models, but also has the ability to capture the dynamic strengthening or weakening of connections over time. Using a state-of-the-art Convex Optimization Modelling for Microstructure-Informed Tractography (COMMIT) approach, in a sample of children and adolescents (n = 88, aged 8 to 18 years), we show that this model can accurately approximate simultaneously the topology and edge-weights of the connectome (specifically, the MRI signal fraction attributed to axonal projections). We achieve this at both sparse and dense connectome densities. Generative model fits are comparable to, and in many cases better than, published findings simulating topology in the absence of weights. Our findings have implications for future research by providing new avenues for exploring normative developmental trends, models of neural computation and wider conceptual implications of the economics of connectomics supporting human functioning.\nConverging on consistent functional connectomics\nAuthors: Luppi, A.

A.\nScore: 47.3, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546329\nFunctional interactions between brain regions can be viewed as a network, empowering neuroscientists to leverage network science to investigate distributed brain function. However, obtaining a brain network from functional neuroimaging data involves multiple steps of data manipulation, which can drastically affect the organisation and validity of the estimated brain network and its properties. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 576 unique data-processing pipelines for functional connectomics from resting-state functional MRI, obtained from all possible recombinations of popular choices for brain atlas type and size, connectivity definition and selection, and global signal regression. We use the portrait divergence, an information-theoretic measure of differences in network topology across scales, to quantify the influence of analytic choices on the overall organisation of the derived functional connectome. We evaluate each pipeline across an entire battery of criteria, seeking pipelines that (i) minimise spurious test-retest discrepancies of network topology, while simultaneously (ii) mitigating motion confounds, and being sensitive to both (iii) inter-subject differences and (iv) experimental effects of interest, as demonstrated by propofol-induced general anaesthesia. Our findings reveal vast and systematic variability across pipelines suitability for functional connectomics. Choice of the wrong data-processing pipeline can lead to results that are not only misleading, but systematically so, distorting the functional connectome more drastically than the passage of several months. We also found that the majority of pipelines failed to meet at least one of our criteria. However, we identified 8 candidates satisfying all criteria across each of four independent datasets spanning minutes, weeks, and months, ensuring the generalisability of our recommendations. Our results also generalise to alternative acquisition parameters and preprocessing and denoising choices. By providing the community with a full breakdown of each pipelines performance across this multi-dataset, multi-criteria, multi-scale and multi-step approach, we establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to inform future best practices in functional connectomics.\nDevelopmental molecular controls over arealization of descending cortical motor pathways\nAuthors: Abe, P.; Lavalley, A.; Morassut, I.; Klingler, E.; Santinha, A. J.; Platt, R. J.; Jabaudon, D.\nScore: 41.0, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.546438\nLayer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons are a main class of neocortical projection neurons that predominate in the motor cortex and send their axon to the pons and spinal cord, and collaterals to the thalamus and multiple deep subcerebral structures. Precise connectivity of ET neurons is critical for fine motor control; they are central to loss of function upon spinal cord injury and specifically degenerate in select neurodegenerative disorders. ET neurons consist of several types of cells with distinct laminar and areal locations, molecular identities, connectivities, and functions. Within layer 5 of the cortex, two cardinal subtypes of ET neurons have been identified: ETlower neurons, which express Slco2a1 and project to distal targets including the spinal cord, ETupper neurons, which express Nprs1 or Hpgd and project more proximally to the pons and thalamus. Despite their critical function, how these neuronal subtypes emerge during development and acquire their area-specific distributions remains unaddressed. Here, using combinations of anatomical labeling, MAPseq mapping, and single-nucleus transcriptomics across developing cortical areas, we reveal that these two subtypes of ET neurons are present at birth along opposite antero-posterior cortical gradients. We first characterize area-specific developmental axonal dynamics of ETlower and ETupper neurons and find that the latter can emerge by pruning of subsets of ETlower neurons. We next identify area- and ET neuron type-specific developmental transcriptional programs to identify key target genes in vivo. Finally, we reprogram ET neuron area-specific connectivity from motor to visual by postnatal in vivo combinatorial knockout of three key type-specific transcription factors. Together, these findings delineate the functional transcriptional programs controlling ET neuron diversity across cortical areas and provide a molecular blueprint to investigate and direct the developmental emergence of corticospinal motor control.\nMicroglia produce the amyloidogenic ABri peptide in familial British dementia\nAuthors: Arber, C.; Casey, J.

M.; Salih, D. A.; Lashley, T.; Wray, S.\nScore: 34.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546552\nMutations in ITM2B cause familial British, Danish, Chinese and Korean dementias. In familial British dementia (FBD) a mutation in the stop codon of the ITM2B gene (also known as BRI2) causes a C-terminal cleavage fragment of the ITM2B/BRI2 protein to be extended by 11 amino acids. This fragment, termed amyloid-Bri (ABri), is highly insoluble and forms extracellular plaques in the brain. ABri plaques are accompanied by tau pathology, neuronal cell death and progressive dementia, with striking parallels to the aetiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease. The molecular mechanisms underpinning FBD are ill-defined. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that expression of ITM2B/BRI2 is 34-fold higher in microglia than neurons, and 15-fold higher in microglia compared with astrocytes. This cell-specific enrichment is supported by expression data from both mouse and human brain tissue. ITM2B/BRI2 protein levels are higher in iPSC-microglia compared with neurons and astrocytes. Consequently, the ABri peptide was detected in patient iPSC-derived microglial lysates and conditioned media but was undetectable in patient-derived neurons and control microglia. Pathological examination of post-mortem tissue support ABri expression in microglia that are in proximity to pre-amyloid deposits. Finally, gene co-expression analysis supports a role for ITM2B/BRI2 in disease-associated microglial responses. These data demonstrate that microglia are the major contributors to the production of amyloid forming peptides in FBD, potentially acting as instigators of neurodegeneration. Additionally, these data also suggest ITM2B/BRI2 may be part of a microglial response to disease, motivating further investigations of its role in microglial activation. This has implications for our understanding of the role of microglia and the innate immune response in the pathogenesis of FBD and other neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimers disease.\nSpatially clustered neurons encode vocalization categories in the bat midbrain\nAuthors: Lawlor, J.; Wohlgemuth, M.; Moss, C. F.; Kuchibhotla, K. V.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2023-06-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.545029\nRapid categorization of vocalizations enables adaptive behavior across species. While categorical perception is thought to arise in the neocortex, humans and other animals could benefit from functional organization of ethologically-relevant sounds at earlier stages in the auditory hierarchy. Here, we developed two-photon calcium imaging in the awake echolocating bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to study encoding of sound meaning in the Inferior Colliculus, which is as few as two synapses from the inner ear. Echolocating bats produce and interpret frequency sweep-based vocalizations for social communication and navigation. Auditory playback experiments demonstrated that individual neurons responded selectively to social or navigation calls, enabling robust population-level decoding across categories. Strikingly, category-selective neurons formed spatial clusters, independent of tonotopy within the IC. These findings support a revised view of categorical processing in which specified channels for ethologically-relevant sounds are spatially segregated early in the auditory hierarchy, enabling rapid subcortical organization of call meaning.\nInactivation of face selective neurons alters eye movements when free viewing faces\nAuthors: Azadi, R.; Lopez, E.; Taubert, J.; Patterson, A.; Afraz, A.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.544678\nDuring free viewing, faces attract gaze and induce specific fixation patterns corresponding to the facial features. This suggests that neurons encoding the facial features are in the causal chain that steers the eyes. However, there is no physiological evidence to support a mechanistic link between face encoding neurons in high-level visual areas and the oculomotor system. In this study, we targeted the middle face patches of inferior temporal (IT) cortex in two macaque monkeys using an fMRI localizer. We then utilized muscimol microinjection to unilaterally suppress IT neural activity inside and outside the face patches and recorded eye movements while the animals free viewing natural scenes. Inactivation of the face selective neurons altered the pattern of eye movements on faces: the monkeys found faces in the scene but neglected the eye ipsilateral to the inactivation hemisphere. These findings reveal the causal contribution of the high-level visual cortex in eye movements. SignificanceIt has been shown, for more than half a century, that eye movements follow distinctive patterns when free viewing faces. This suggests causal involvement of the face-encoding visual neurons in the eye movements. However, the literature is scant of evidence for this possibility and has focused mostly on the link between low-level image saliency and eye movements. Here, for the first time, we bring causal evidence showing how face-selective neurons in inferior temporal cortex inform and steer eye movements when free viewing faces.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analyzing electron microscopic (EM) brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x10^7 chemical synapses between ~130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the flys success as a model organism in modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and hierarchical annotation of this [~]130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the &#34;hemibrain&#34; connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation: connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing &gt;1% of the input to a target cell are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional homeostasis through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity. These theories have independently accrued evidence, yet, confirmation bias and dependence on design choices hamper progress in the field. Here, we present an open science adversarial collaboration which directly juxtaposes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), employing a theory-neutral consortium approach. We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex. Beyond challenging the theories themselves, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through a principled, theory-driven, collaborative effort. We highlight the challenges to change people&#39;s mind and the need for a quantitative framework integrating evidence for systematic theory testing and building.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Effective communication hinges on a mutual understanding of word meaning in different contexts. The embedding space learned by large language models can serve as an explicit model of the shared, context-rich meaning space humans use to communicate their thoughts. We recorded brain activity using electrocorticography during spontaneous, face-to-face conversations in five pairs of epilepsy patients. We demonstrate that the linguistic embedding space can capture the linguistic content of word-by-word neural alignment between speaker and listener. Linguistic content emerged in the speaker&#39;s brain before word articulation, and the same linguistic content rapidly reemerged in the listener&#39;s brain after word articulation. These findings establish a computational framework to study how human brains transmit their thoughts to one another in real-world contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Probabilistic generative network models have offered an exciting window into the constraints governing the human connectomes organization. In particular, they have highlighted the economic context of network formation and the special roles that physical geometry and self-similarity likely play in determining the connectomes topology. However, a critical limitation of these models is that they do not consider the strength of anatomical connectivity between regions. This significantly limits their scope to answer neurobiological questions. The current work draws inspiration from the principle of redundancy reduction to develop a novel weighted generative network model. This weighted generative network model is a significant advance because it not only incorporates the theoretical advancements of previous models, but also has the ability to capture the dynamic strengthening or weakening of connections over time. Using a state-of-the-art Convex Optimization Modelling for Microstructure-Informed Tractography (COMMIT) approach, in a sample of children and adolescents (n = 88, aged 8 to 18 years), we show that this model can accurately approximate simultaneously the topology and edge-weights of the connectome (specifically, the MRI signal fraction attributed to axonal projections). We achieve this at both sparse and dense connectome densities. Generative model fits are comparable to, and in many cases better than, published findings simulating topology in the absence of weights. Our findings have implications for future research by providing new avenues for exploring normative developmental trends, models of neural computation and wider conceptual implications of the economics of connectomics supporting human functioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Functional interactions between brain regions can be viewed as a network, empowering neuroscientists to leverage network science to investigate distributed brain function. However, obtaining a brain network from functional neuroimaging data involves multiple steps of data manipulation, which can drastically affect the organisation and validity of the estimated brain network and its properties. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 576 unique data-processing pipelines for functional connectomics from resting-state functional MRI, obtained from all possible recombinations of popular choices for brain atlas type and size, connectivity definition and selection, and global signal regression. We use the portrait divergence, an information-theoretic measure of differences in network topology across scales, to quantify the influence of analytic choices on the overall organisation of the derived functional connectome. We evaluate each pipeline across an entire battery of criteria, seeking pipelines that (i) minimise spurious test-retest discrepancies of network topology, while simultaneously (ii) mitigating motion confounds, and being sensitive to both (iii) inter-subject differences and (iv) experimental effects of interest, as demonstrated by propofol-induced general anaesthesia. Our findings reveal vast and systematic variability across pipelines suitability for functional connectomics. Choice of the wrong data-processing pipeline can lead to results that are not only misleading, but systematically so, distorting the functional connectome more drastically than the passage of several months. We also found that the majority of pipelines failed to meet at least one of our criteria. However, we identified 8 candidates satisfying all criteria across each of four independent datasets spanning minutes, weeks, and months, ensuring the generalisability of our recommendations. Our results also generalise to alternative acquisition parameters and preprocessing and denoising choices. By providing the community with a full breakdown of each pipelines performance across this multi-dataset, multi-criteria, multi-scale and multi-step approach, we establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks to inform future best practices in functional connectomics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons are a main class of neocortical projection neurons that predominate in the motor cortex and send their axon to the pons and spinal cord, and collaterals to the thalamus and multiple deep subcerebral structures. Precise connectivity of ET neurons is critical for fine motor control; they are central to loss of function upon spinal cord injury and specifically degenerate in select neurodegenerative disorders. ET neurons consist of several types of cells with distinct laminar and areal locations, molecular identities, connectivities, and functions. Within layer 5 of the cortex, two cardinal subtypes of ET neurons have been identified: ETlower neurons, which express Slco2a1 and project to distal targets including the spinal cord, ETupper neurons, which express Nprs1 or Hpgd and project more proximally to the pons and thalamus. Despite their critical function, how these neuronal subtypes emerge during development and acquire their area-specific distributions remains unaddressed. Here, using combinations of anatomical labeling, MAPseq mapping, and single-nucleus transcriptomics across developing cortical areas, we reveal that these two subtypes of ET neurons are present at birth along opposite antero-posterior cortical gradients. We first characterize area-specific developmental axonal dynamics of ETlower and ETupper neurons and find that the latter can emerge by pruning of subsets of ETlower neurons. We next identify area- and ET neuron type-specific developmental transcriptional programs to identify key target genes in vivo. Finally, we reprogram ET neuron area-specific connectivity from motor to visual by postnatal in vivo combinatorial knockout of three key type-specific transcription factors. Together, these findings delineate the functional transcriptional programs controlling ET neuron diversity across cortical areas and provide a molecular blueprint to investigate and direct the developmental emergence of corticospinal motor control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in ITM2B cause familial British, Danish, Chinese and Korean dementias. In familial British dementia (FBD) a mutation in the stop codon of the ITM2B gene (also known as BRI2) causes a C-terminal cleavage fragment of the ITM2B/BRI2 protein to be extended by 11 amino acids. This fragment, termed amyloid-Bri (ABri), is highly insoluble and forms extracellular plaques in the brain. ABri plaques are accompanied by tau pathology, neuronal cell death and progressive dementia, with striking parallels to the aetiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease. The molecular mechanisms underpinning FBD are ill-defined. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that expression of ITM2B/BRI2 is 34-fold higher in microglia than neurons, and 15-fold higher in microglia compared with astrocytes. This cell-specific enrichment is supported by expression data from both mouse and human brain tissue. ITM2B/BRI2 protein levels are higher in iPSC-microglia compared with neurons and astrocytes. Consequently, the ABri peptide was detected in patient iPSC-derived microglial lysates and conditioned media but was undetectable in patient-derived neurons and control microglia. Pathological examination of post-mortem tissue support ABri expression in microglia that are in proximity to pre-amyloid deposits. Finally, gene co-expression analysis supports a role for ITM2B/BRI2 in disease-associated microglial responses. These data demonstrate that microglia are the major contributors to the production of amyloid forming peptides in FBD, potentially acting as instigators of neurodegeneration. Additionally, these data also suggest ITM2B/BRI2 may be part of a microglial response to disease, motivating further investigations of its role in microglial activation. This has implications for our understanding of the role of microglia and the innate immune response in the pathogenesis of FBD and other neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimers disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rapid categorization of vocalizations enables adaptive behavior across species. While categorical perception is thought to arise in the neocortex, humans and other animals could benefit from functional organization of ethologically-relevant sounds at earlier stages in the auditory hierarchy. Here, we developed two-photon calcium imaging in the awake echolocating bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to study encoding of sound meaning in the Inferior Colliculus, which is as few as two synapses from the inner ear. Echolocating bats produce and interpret frequency sweep-based vocalizations for social communication and navigation. Auditory playback experiments demonstrated that individual neurons responded selectively to social or navigation calls, enabling robust population-level decoding across categories. Strikingly, category-selective neurons formed spatial clusters, independent of tonotopy within the IC. These findings support a revised view of categorical processing in which specified channels for ethologically-relevant sounds are spatially segregated early in the auditory hierarchy, enabling rapid subcortical organization of call meaning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During free viewing, faces attract gaze and induce specific fixation patterns corresponding to the facial features. This suggests that neurons encoding the facial features are in the causal chain that steers the eyes. However, there is no physiological evidence to support a mechanistic link between face encoding neurons in high-level visual areas and the oculomotor system. In this study, we targeted the middle face patches of inferior temporal (IT) cortex in two macaque monkeys using an fMRI localizer. We then utilized muscimol microinjection to unilaterally suppress IT neural activity inside and outside the face patches and recorded eye movements while the animals free viewing natural scenes. Inactivation of the face selective neurons altered the pattern of eye movements on faces: the monkeys found faces in the scene but neglected the eye ipsilateral to the inactivation hemisphere. These findings reveal the causal contribution of the high-level visual cortex in eye movements.

SignificanceIt has been shown, for more than half a century, that eye movements follow distinctive patterns when free viewing faces. This suggests causal involvement of the face-encoding visual neurons in the eye movements. However, the literature is scant of evidence for this possibility and has focused mostly on the link between low-level image saliency and eye movements. Here, for the first time, we bring causal evidence showing how face-selective neurons in inferior temporal cortex inform and steer eye movements when free viewing faces.</p>
