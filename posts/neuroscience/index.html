While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.\nSARS-CoV-2 Spike amyloid fibrils specifically and selectively accelerates amyloid fibril formation of human prion protein and the amyloid β peptide\nAuthors: Larsson, J. N.; Hellstrand, E.; Hammarström, P.; Nyström, S.\nScore: 2145.4, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555834\nAn increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity. Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.\nTSWIFT, a novel method for iterative staining of embedded and mounted human brain sections.\nAuthors: Porter, C. M.; truttmann, m.\nScore: 50.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558493\nComprehensive characterization of protein networks in mounted brain tissue represents a major challenge in brain and neurodegenerative disease research. In this study, we develop a simple staining method, called TSWIFT, to iteratively stain pre-mounted formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) brain sections, thus enabling high-dimensional sample phenotyping. We show that TSWIFT conserves tissue architecture and allows for relabeling a single mounted FFPE sample more than 10 times, even after prolonged storage at 4 degree celcius. Using TSWIFT, we profile the abundance and localization of the HSP70 family chaperones HSC70 (HSPA8) and BiP (HSPA5) in mounted human brain tissue. Our results establish TSWIFT as an efficient method to obtain integrated high-dimensional knowledge of cellular proteomes by analyzing mounted FFPE human brain tissue.\nSerotonin predictively encodes value\nAuthors: Harkin, E. F.; Grossman, C. D.; Cohen, J. Y.; Beïque, J.-C.; Naud, R.\nScore: 40.8, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558526\nThe in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision \u003c\u003c0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.\nPreconfigured cortico-thalamic neural dynamics constrain movement-associated thalamic activity\nAuthors: Gonzalez-Pereyra, P.; Martinez-Montalvo, M. G.; Ortega-Romero, D. I.; Perez-Diaz, C. I.; Merchant, H.; Tellez, L. A.; Rueda-Orozco, P. E.\nScore: 34.8, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558667\nNeural preconfigured activity patterns (nPAPs) have been proposed as basic building blocks for cognitive and sensory processing. However, their existence and function in motor networks have not been explicitly studied. Here, we explore the possibility that nPAPs are present in the motor thalamus (VL/VM) and their potential contribution to motor-related activity. To this end, we developed a preparation where VL/VM multiunitary activity could be robustly recorded in mouse behavior evoked by primary motor cortex (M1) optogenetic stimulation and forelimb movements. VL/VM-evoked activity was organized as rigid stereotypical activity patterns at the single and population levels. These activity patterns were unable to dynamically adapt to different temporal architectures of M1 stimulation. Moreover, they were experience-independent and present in virtually all animals, confirming their preconfigured nature. Finally, subpopulations expressing specific M1-evoked patterns also displayed specific movement-related patterns. Our data demonstrate that the behaviorally related identity of specific neural subpopulations is tightly linked to nPAPs.\nXylazine is an agonist at kappa opioid receptors and exhibits sex-specific responses to naloxone administration\nAuthors: Bedard, M.

A.\nScore: 253.7, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556914\nXylazine has been found in the unregulated drug supply at increasing rates, usually in combination with fentanyl. It has become critical to understand its basic pharmacology, how it impacts behavior, and how it interacts with fentanyl in rodent models of opioid administration. Despite commentary from scientists, politicians, and public health officials, it is not known if xylazine impacts the efficacy of naloxone, the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression. Furthermore, few studies have examined the effects of xylazine alone, without co-administration of ketamine. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several key behaviors in male and female mice. We demonstrate differential locomotor responses by dose and sex to xylazine. Surprisingly, our results further indicate that naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and a fentanyl/xylazine combination, in both sexes, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, we show that xylazine is a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity. One-Sentence SummaryWe present surprising new insights into xylazine and fentanyl pharmacology with immediate implications for clinical practice and frontline public health.\nWhere the present gets remembered: Sensory regions communicate with the brain over the longest timescales.\nAuthors: Cooper, G. J.; Blackburne, G.; Dekker, T. M.; Das, R. K.; Skipper, J. I.\nScore: 32.2, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558347\nIn natural contexts, the brain simultaneously processes sensory information over diverse timescales. Here we reveal how this is reflected in the organisation of asynchronous connectivity in the brain. In 86 individuals watching feature-length movies during functional neuroimaging, we calculated the delay at peak connectivity between brain regions. We found the longest delays in received whole-brain functional connectivity within sensory regions (:S 18 seconds). Two complementary dimensionality reduction approaches were used to probe the spatial organisation of connection delays and weights. First, clustering of received delays separated sensory, and transmodal/associative outputting regions, suggesting that putatively localised functions are associated with asynchronous local-to-whole-brain connectivity patterns. Next, we organised delayed connectivity maps by likeness, unveiling five orthogonal gradients of variation, each demonstrating associations between early-sensory and transmodal/associative regions. Together, these findings challenge contemporary conceptualisations of the brains temporal hierarchy by emphasising the role of sensory regions as sites of integration across timescales.\nToolbox for Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport: Application to unsupervised alignment in neuroscience\nAuthors: Sasaki, M.; Takeda, K.; Abe, K.; Oizumi, M.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558038\nGromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT) has emerged as a versatile method for unsupervised alignment in various research areas, including neuroscience, drawing upon the strengths of optimal transport theory. However, the use of GWOT in various applications has been hindered by the difficulty of finding good optima, a significant challenge stemming from GWOTs nature as a non-convex optimization method. It is often difficult to avoid suboptimal local optima because of the need for systematic hyperparameter tuning. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a user-friendly GWOT hyperparameter tuning toolbox (GWTune) specifically designed to streamline the use of GWOT in neuroscience and other fields. The toolbox incorporates Optuna, an advanced hyperparameter tuning tool that uses Bayesian sampling to increase the chances of finding favorable local optima. To demonstrate the utility of our toolbox, we first illustrate the qualitative difference between the conventional supervised alignment method and our unsupervised alignment method using synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of our toolbox using some typical examples in neuroscience. Specifically, we applied GWOT to the similarity structures of natural objects or natural scenes obtained from three data domains: behavioral data, neural data, and neural network models. This toolbox is an accessible and robust solution for practical applications in neuroscience and beyond, making the powerful GWOT methodology more accessible to a wider range of users. The open source code for the toolbox is available on GitHub. This work not only facilitates the application of GWOT, but also opens avenues for future improvements and extensions.\nNeuroMechFly 2.0, a framework for simulating embodied sensorimotor control in adult Drosophila\nAuthors: Wang-Chen, S.; Stimpfling, V. A.; Ozdil, P. G.; Genoud, L.; Hurtak, F.; Ramdya, P.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.556649\nDiscovering the principles underlying the neural and biomechanical control of animal behavior requires a tight dialogue between real experiments and data-driven neuromechanical models. Until now, such models have primarily been used to further our understanding of lower-level motor control. For most whole-animal simulations, we still lack an effective framework for studying how the brain processes environmental signals to regulate motor behavior. The adult fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is well-suited for data-driven modeling and can be simulated using the neuromechanical model, NeuroMechFly. However, until now this simulation framework did not permit the exploration of full hierarchical sensorimotor loops. Here we present NeuroMechFly 2.0, a framework that greatly expands whole-animal modeling of Drosophila by enabling visual and olfactory processing as well as complex three-dimensional environments that can be navigated using leg adhesion. To illustrate its capabilities we explore the effectiveness of biologically-inspired leg controllers for navigating diverse terrain, and show how one can build and use Reinforcement Learning to train an end-to-end hierarchical model with multimodal sensory processing, descending commands, and low-level motor control in closed loop. NeuroMechFly 2.0 can accelerate the discovery of explanatory models of the nervous system and the development of machine learning models to control autonomous artificial agents and robots.\nA modular circuit architecture coordinates the diversification of courtship strategies in Drosophila\nAuthors: Coleman, R. T.; Morantte, I.; Koreman, G. T.; Cheng, M. L.; Ding, Y.; Ruta, V.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558080\nIdentifying a mate is a central imperative for males of most species but poses the challenge of distinguishing a suitable partner from an array of potential male competitors or females of related species. Mate recognition systems are thus subject to strong selective pressures, driving the rapid coevolution of female sensory cues and male sensory preferences. Here we leverage the rapid evolution of female pheromones across the Drosophila genus to gain insight into how males coordinately adapt their detection and interpretation of these chemical cues to hone their mating strategies. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to attract and arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition. By comparing several close and distantly-related Drosophila species, we reveal that D. yakuba males have evolved the distinct ability to use a sexually-monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene (7-T), as an excitatory cue to promote courtship, a sensory innovation that enables D. yakuba males to court in the dark thereby expanding their reproductive opportunities. To gain insight into the neural adaptations that enable 7-T to act as an excitatory cue, we compared the functional properties of two key nodes within the pheromone circuits of D. yakuba and a subset of its closest relatives. We show that the instructive role of 7-T in D. yakuba arises from concurrent peripheral and central circuit changes: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-T which in turn selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain that trigger courtship behaviors. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to multiple parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing males to take advantage of novel sensory modalities to become aroused. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly linked to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition and courtship strategies across species.\n",

        <p class="abstract">With the omnipresence of social media, Boys&#39; Love (BL) culture has found a burgeoning audience among young females. While this cultural phenomenon offers a platform for self-expression to some, its potential implications remain underexplored. This study investigates whether immersion in BL culture impacts the process of young females forming self-recognition and identification of sexual orientation. Employing an fNIRS-based experiment focusing on the prefrontal cortex, we compared the neurological responses of young females within and outside the BL media cocoon when exposed to sexuality-related stimuli. Our findings revealed significant neural differences in the experimental group viewing BL images compared to the control group. These results provide fresh insights into how BL content may shape our cognition and attitudes, emphasizing the need for guidance in content consumption among young females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection.

We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity.

Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Comprehensive characterization of protein networks in mounted brain tissue represents a major challenge in brain and neurodegenerative disease research. In this study, we develop a simple staining method, called TSWIFT, to iteratively stain pre-mounted formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) brain sections, thus enabling high-dimensional sample phenotyping. We show that TSWIFT conserves tissue architecture and allows for relabeling a single mounted FFPE sample more than 10 times, even after prolonged storage at 4 degree celcius. Using TSWIFT, we profile the abundance and localization of the HSP70 family chaperones HSC70 (HSPA8) and BiP (HSPA5) in mounted human brain tissue. Our results establish TSWIFT as an efficient method to obtain integrated high-dimensional knowledge of cellular proteomes by analyzing mounted FFPE human brain tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin neurons to emotionally-salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centred on reward, surprise, or uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Here we find a unifying perspective in a biologically-constrained predictive code for cumulative future reward, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. Through simulations of trace conditioning experiments common in the serotonin literature, we show that our theory, called value prediction, intuitively explains phasic activation by both rewards and punishments, preference for surprising rewards but absence of a corresponding preference for punishments, and contextual modulation of tonic firing--observations that currently form the basis of many and varied serotonergic theories. Next, we re-analyzed data from a recent experiment and found serotonin neurons with activity patterns that are a surprisingly close match: our theory predicts the marginal effect of reward history on population activity with a precision &lt;&lt;0.1 Hz neuron-1. Finally, we directly compared against quantitative formulations of existing ideas and found that our theory best explains both within-trial activity dynamics and trial-to-trial modulations, offering performance usually several times better than the closest alternative. Overall, our results show that previous models are not wrong, but incomplete, and that reward, surprise, salience, and uncertainty are simply different faces of a predictively-encoded value signal. By unifying previous theories, our work represents an important step towards understanding the potentially heterogeneous computational roles of serotonin in learning, behaviour, and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural preconfigured activity patterns (nPAPs) have been proposed as basic building blocks for cognitive and sensory processing. However, their existence and function in motor networks have not been explicitly studied. Here, we explore the possibility that nPAPs are present in the motor thalamus (VL/VM) and their potential contribution to motor-related activity. To this end, we developed a preparation where VL/VM multiunitary activity could be robustly recorded in mouse behavior evoked by primary motor cortex (M1) optogenetic stimulation and forelimb movements. VL/VM-evoked activity was organized as rigid stereotypical activity patterns at the single and population levels. These activity patterns were unable to dynamically adapt to different temporal architectures of M1 stimulation. Moreover, they were experience-independent and present in virtually all animals, confirming their preconfigured nature. Finally, subpopulations expressing specific M1-evoked patterns also displayed specific movement-related patterns. Our data demonstrate that the behaviorally related identity of specific neural subpopulations is tightly linked to nPAPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Xylazine has been found in the unregulated drug supply at increasing rates, usually in combination with fentanyl. It has become critical to understand its basic pharmacology, how it impacts behavior, and how it interacts with fentanyl in rodent models of opioid administration. Despite commentary from scientists, politicians, and public health officials, it is not known if xylazine impacts the efficacy of naloxone, the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression. Furthermore, few studies have examined the effects of xylazine alone, without co-administration of ketamine. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several key behaviors in male and female mice. We demonstrate differential locomotor responses by dose and sex to xylazine. Surprisingly, our results further indicate that naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and a fentanyl/xylazine combination, in both sexes, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, we show that xylazine is a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity.

One-Sentence SummaryWe present surprising new insights into xylazine and fentanyl pharmacology with immediate implications for clinical practice and frontline public health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In natural contexts, the brain simultaneously processes sensory information over diverse timescales. Here we reveal how this is reflected in the organisation of asynchronous connectivity in the brain. In 86 individuals watching feature-length movies during functional neuroimaging, we calculated the delay at peak connectivity between brain regions. We found the longest delays in received whole-brain functional connectivity within  sensory regions (:S 18 seconds). Two complementary dimensionality reduction approaches were used to probe the spatial organisation of connection delays and weights. First, clustering of received delays separated sensory, and transmodal/associative outputting regions, suggesting that putatively localised functions are associated with asynchronous local-to-whole-brain connectivity patterns. Next, we organised delayed connectivity maps by likeness, unveiling five orthogonal gradients of variation, each demonstrating associations between early-sensory and transmodal/associative regions. Together, these findings challenge contemporary conceptualisations of the brains temporal hierarchy by emphasising the role of sensory regions as sites of integration across timescales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT) has emerged as a versatile method for unsupervised alignment in various research areas, including neuroscience, drawing upon the strengths of optimal transport theory. However, the use of GWOT in various applications has been hindered by the difficulty of finding good optima, a significant challenge stemming from GWOTs nature as a non-convex optimization method. It is often difficult to avoid suboptimal local optima because of the need for systematic hyperparameter tuning. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a user-friendly GWOT hyperparameter tuning toolbox (GWTune) specifically designed to streamline the use of GWOT in neuroscience and other fields. The toolbox incorporates Optuna, an advanced hyperparameter tuning tool that uses Bayesian sampling to increase the chances of finding favorable local optima. To demonstrate the utility of our toolbox, we first illustrate the qualitative difference between the conventional supervised alignment method and our unsupervised alignment method using synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of our toolbox using some typical examples in neuroscience. Specifically, we applied GWOT to the similarity structures of natural objects or natural scenes obtained from three data domains: behavioral data, neural data, and neural network models. This toolbox is an accessible and robust solution for practical applications in neuroscience and beyond, making the powerful GWOT methodology more accessible to a wider range of users. The open source code for the toolbox is available on GitHub. This work not only facilitates the application of GWOT, but also opens avenues for future improvements and extensions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Discovering the principles underlying the neural and biomechanical control of animal behavior requires a tight dialogue between real experiments and data-driven neuromechanical models. Until now, such models have primarily been used to further our understanding of lower-level motor control. For most whole-animal simulations, we still lack an effective framework for studying how the brain processes environmental signals to regulate motor behavior. The adult fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is well-suited for data-driven modeling and can be simulated using the neuromechanical model, NeuroMechFly. However, until now this simulation framework did not permit the exploration of full hierarchical sensorimotor loops. Here we present NeuroMechFly 2.0, a framework that greatly expands whole-animal modeling of Drosophila by enabling visual and olfactory processing as well as complex three-dimensional environments that can be navigated using leg adhesion. To illustrate its capabilities we explore the effectiveness of biologically-inspired leg controllers for navigating diverse terrain, and show how one can build and use Reinforcement Learning to train an end-to-end hierarchical model with multimodal sensory processing, descending commands, and low-level motor control in closed loop. NeuroMechFly 2.0 can accelerate the discovery of explanatory models of the nervous system and the development of machine learning models to control autonomous artificial agents and robots.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Identifying a mate is a central imperative for males of most species but poses the challenge of distinguishing a suitable partner from an array of potential male competitors or females of related species. Mate recognition systems are thus subject to strong selective pressures, driving the rapid coevolution of female sensory cues and male sensory preferences. Here we leverage the rapid evolution of female pheromones across the Drosophila genus to gain insight into how males coordinately adapt their detection and interpretation of these chemical cues to hone their mating strategies. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to attract and arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition. By comparing several close and distantly-related Drosophila species, we reveal that D. yakuba males have evolved the distinct ability to use a sexually-monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene (7-T), as an excitatory cue to promote courtship, a sensory innovation that enables D. yakuba males to court in the dark thereby expanding their reproductive opportunities. To gain insight into the neural adaptations that enable 7-T to act as an excitatory cue, we compared the functional properties of two key nodes within the pheromone circuits of D. yakuba and a subset of its closest relatives. We show that the instructive role of 7-T in D. yakuba arises from concurrent peripheral and central circuit changes: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-T which in turn selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain that trigger courtship behaviors. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to multiple parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing males to take advantage of novel sensory modalities to become aroused. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly linked to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition and courtship strategies across species.</p>
