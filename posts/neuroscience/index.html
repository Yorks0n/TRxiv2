E.; Spruston, N.\nScore: 83.5, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551900\nCognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.\nNeurons in the human entorhinal cortex map abstract emotion space\nAuthors: Qasim, S. E.; Reinacher, P. C.; Brandt, A.; Schulze-Bonhage, A.; Kunz, L.\nScore: 41.5, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552884\nWhen animals move through space, neurons in their entorhinal cortex activate periodically at multiple locations to form a map of the spatial environment. These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.\nA collaboration between immune cells and the choroid plexus epithelium in brain inflammation\nAuthors: Xu, H.; Lotfy, P.; Gelb, S.; Pragana, A.; Hehnly, C.; Shipley, F. B.; Zawadzki, M. E.; Cui, J.; Deng, L.; Taylor, M.; Webb, M.; Lidov, H. G. W.; Andermann, M. L.; Chiu, I. M.; Ordovas-Montanes, J.; Lehtinen, M. K.\nScore: 35.3, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552298\nThe choroid plexus (ChP) is a vital brain barrier and source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we use chronic two-photon imaging in awake mice and single-cell transcriptomics to demonstrate that in addition to these roles, the ChP is a complex immune organ that regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse meningitis model, neutrophils and monocytes accumulated in ChP stroma and surged across the epithelial barrier into the CSF. Bi-directional recruitment of monocytes from the periphery and, unexpectedly, macrophages from the CSF to the ChP helped eliminate neutrophils and repair the barrier. Transcriptomic analyses detailed the molecular steps accompanying this process, including the discovery of epithelial cells that transiently specialized to nurture immune cells, coordinate their recruitment, survival, and differentiation, and ultimately, control the opening/closing of the ChP brain barrier. Collectively, we provide a new conceptual understanding and comprehensive roadmap of neuroinflammation at the ChP brain barrier.\nWithin-Individual Organization of the Human Cerebral Cortex: Networks, Global Topography, and Function\nAuthors: Du, J.; DiNicola, L. M.; Angeli, P. A.; Saadon-Grosman, N.; Sun, W.; Kaiser, S.; Ladopoulou, J.; Xue, A.; Yeo, B. T. T.; Eldaief, M. C.; Buckner, R. L.\nScore: 35.2, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552437\nThe human cerebral cortex is populated by specialized regions that are organized into networks. Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian sModel (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.\nReusable, flexible, and lightweight chronic implants for Neuropixels probes\nAuthors: Bimbard, C.; Takacs, F.; Fabre, J. M.; Melin, M. D.; O'Neill, N.; Robacha, M.; Street, J. S.; van Beest, E. H.; Churchland, A. K.; Harris, K. D.; Kullmann, D. M.; Lignani, G.; Carandini, M.; Coen, P.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551752\nUnderstanding neural processes such as memory formation, learning, or aging requires tracking the activity of neural populations across short and long time scales. Such longitudinal recordings can be achieved with chronically implanted Neuropixels probes. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in small animals like mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. In this initial preprint, we present the \"Apollo Implant\", an open-source and editable device that meets all these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The assembled implant comprises two modules: a recoverable \"payload\" module, and a \"docking\" module that is cemented to the skull. The design is readily adjustable: the distance between probes, angle of insertion, and depth of penetration can all be easily changed. We tested the implant across multiple labs, and in head-fixed and freely moving animals. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant thus provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.\nLearning attentional templates for value-based decision-making\nAuthors: Jahn, C. I.; Markov, N. T.; Morea, B.; Ebitz, B.; Buschman, T. J.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550426\nAttention filters sensory inputs to enhance task-relevant information. It is guided by an attentional template that represents the stimulus features that are relevant for the current task. To understand how the brain learns and uses new templates, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task that required them to repeatedly learn new attentional templates. Neural recordings found templates were represented across prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template towards rewarded features. Finally, we found attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template. Altogether, our results provide new insight into the neural mechanisms by which the brain learns to control attention and how attention can be flexibly deployed across tasks.\nA contrastive coding account of category selectivity in the ventral visual stream\nAuthors: Prince, J. S.; Alvarez, G. A.; Konkle, T.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551888\nModular and distributed theories of category selectivity along the ventral visual stream have long existed in tension. Here, we present a reconciling framework, based on a series of analyses relating category-selective tuning within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, visual category-selective tuning naturally emerges for classic categories of faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits. Finally, these pre-identified units from a single model can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of the human visual system, even under a constrained sparse-positive encoding procedure. The success of this model indicates that the nature of category-selective tuning in the human brain (e.g. for faces or scenes) is dependent on the learning diet, and best understood in the context of the full scope of experienced visual input. Broadly, we offer a unifying theoretical account where category-selective tuning naturally emerges as a consequence of positive information routing through hierarchical population codes, in order to disentangle the statistics of visual experience.\nBasolateral amygdala parvalbumin interneurons coordinate oscillations to drive reward behaviors\nAuthors: Amaya, K. A.; Teboul, E.; Weiss, G. L.; Antonoudiou, P.; Maguire, J.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552674\nThe basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in mediating both fear and reward learning. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) in the BLA have previously been shown to contribute to BLA oscillatory states integral to fear expression, but whether BLA oscillatory states and PV interneurons also contribute to reward learning is unknown and critical to our understanding of reward processing. Local field potentials in the BLA were collected as animals consumed a sucrose reward, where prominent changes in the beta band (15-30 Hz) emerged with reward experience. Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons to entrain the BLA network to 20Hz during consumption of one bottle during a two bottle choice test produced a robust bottle preference. Finally, to demonstrate that PV activity is necessary for reward value use, PVs were chemogenetically targeted and inhibited following outcome devaluation, rendering those animals incapable of using updated reward value information to guide their behavior. Taken together, these experiments provide novel information regarding the physiological signatures of reward learning while highlighting the importance of PV interneurons in reward learning. This work builds upon the established knowledge in the field of PV involvement in fear expression and provides evidence that PV orchestration of unique BLA network states is involved in both learning types.\nA competitive disinhibitory network for robust optic flow processing in Drosophila\nAuthors: Erginkaya, M.; Cruz, T. L.; Brotas, M.; Steck, K.; Nern, A.; Torrao, F.; Varela, N.; Bock, D.; Reiser, M. B.; Chiappe, M. E.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552150\nMany animals rely on optic flow for navigation, using differences in eye image velocity to detect deviations from their intended direction of travel. However, asymmetries in image velocity between the eyes are often overshadowed by strong, symmetric translational optic flow during navigation. Yet, the brain efficiently extracts these asymmetries for course control. While optic flow sensitive-neurons have been found in many animal species, far less is known about the postsynaptic circuits that support such robust optic flow processing. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a group of neurons called the horizontal system (HS) are involved in course control during highspeed translation. To understand how HS cells facilitate robust optic flow processing, we identified central networks that connect to HS cells using full brain electron microscopy datasets. These networks comprise three layers: convergent inputs from different, optic flow-sensitive cells, a middle layer with reciprocal, and lateral inhibitory interactions among different interneuron classes, and divergent output projecting to both the ventral nerve cord (equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord), and to deeper regions of the fly brain. By combining two-photon optical imaging to monitor free calcium dynamics, manipulating GABA receptors and modeling, we found that lateral disinhibition between brain hemispheres enhance the selectivity to rotational visual flow at the output layer of the network. Moreover, asymmetric manipulations of interneurons and their descending outputs induce drifts during highspeed walking, confirming their contribution to steering control. Together, these findings highlight the importance of competitive disinhibition as a critical circuit mechanism for robust processing of optic flow, which likely influences course control and heading perception, both critical functions supporting navigation.\nGeneralizable links between symptoms of borderline personality disorder and functional connectivity\nAuthors: Shafiei, G.; Keller, A. S.; Bertolero, M.; Shanmugan, S.; Bassett, D. S.; Chen, A. A.; Covitz, S.; Houghton, A.; Luo, A.; Mehta, K.; Salo, T.; Shinohara, R. T.; Fair, D.; Hallquist, M. N.; Satterthwaite, T. D.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551534\nBackgroundSymptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often manifest in adolescence, yet the underlying relationship between these debilitating symptoms and the development of functional brain networks is not well understood. Here we aimed to investigate how multivariate patterns of functional connectivity are associated with symptoms of BPD in a large sample of young adults and adolescents. MethodsWe used high-quality functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults from the Human Connectome Project: Young Adults (HCP-YA; N = 870, ages 22-37 years, 457 female) and youth from the Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D; N = 223, age range 16-21 years, 121 female). A previously validated BPD proxy score was derived from the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). A ridge regression model with 10-fold cross-validation and nested hyperparameter tuning was trained and tested in HCP-YA to predict BPD scores in unseen data from regional functional connectivity, while controlling for in-scanner motion, age, and sex. The trained model was further tested on data from HCP-D without further tuning. Finally, we tested how the connectivity patterns associated with BPD aligned with agerelated changes in connectivity. ResultsMultivariate functional connectivity patterns significantly predicted out-of-sample BPD proxy scores in unseen data in both young adults (HCP-YA; pperm = 0.001) and older adolescents (HCP-D; pperm = 0.001). Predictive capacity of regions was heterogeneous; the most predictive regions were found in functional systems relevant for emotion regulation and executive function, including the ventral attention network. Finally, regional functional connectivity patterns that predicted BPD proxy scores aligned with those associated with development in youth. ConclusionIndividual differences in functional connectivity in developmentally-sensitive regions are associated with the symptoms of BPD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When animals move through space, neurons in their entorhinal cortex activate periodically at multiple locations to form a map of the spatial environment. These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The choroid plexus (ChP) is a vital brain barrier and source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we use chronic two-photon imaging in awake mice and single-cell transcriptomics to demonstrate that in addition to these roles, the ChP is a complex immune organ that regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse meningitis model, neutrophils and monocytes accumulated in ChP stroma and surged across the epithelial barrier into the CSF. Bi-directional recruitment of monocytes from the periphery and, unexpectedly, macrophages from the CSF to the ChP helped eliminate neutrophils and repair the barrier. Transcriptomic analyses detailed the molecular steps accompanying this process, including the discovery of epithelial cells that transiently specialized to nurture immune cells, coordinate their recruitment, survival, and differentiation, and ultimately, control the opening/closing of the ChP brain barrier. Collectively, we provide a new conceptual understanding and comprehensive roadmap of neuroinflammation at the ChP brain barrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human cerebral cortex is populated by specialized regions that are organized into networks. Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian sModel (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding neural processes such as memory formation, learning, or aging requires tracking the activity of neural populations across short and long time scales. Such longitudinal recordings can be achieved with chronically implanted Neuropixels probes. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) be light enough for use in small animals like mice; (3) allow reuse of the probes after explantation. In this initial preprint, we present the &#34;Apollo Implant&#34;, an open-source and editable device that meets all these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The assembled implant comprises two modules: a recoverable &#34;payload&#34; module, and a &#34;docking&#34; module that is cemented to the skull. The design is readily adjustable: the distance between probes, angle of insertion, and depth of penetration can all be easily changed. We tested the implant across multiple labs, and in head-fixed and freely moving animals. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant thus provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Attention filters sensory inputs to enhance task-relevant information. It is guided by an  attentional template that represents the stimulus features that are relevant for the current task. To understand how the brain learns and uses new templates, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task that required them to repeatedly learn new attentional templates. Neural recordings found templates were represented across prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template towards rewarded features. Finally, we found attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template. Altogether, our results provide new insight into the neural mechanisms by which the brain learns to control attention and how attention can be flexibly deployed across tasks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Modular and distributed theories of category selectivity along the ventral visual stream have long existed in tension. Here, we present a reconciling framework, based on a series of analyses relating category-selective tuning within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, visual category-selective tuning naturally emerges for classic categories of faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits. Finally, these pre-identified units from a single model can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of the human visual system, even under a constrained sparse-positive encoding procedure. The success of this model indicates that the nature of category-selective tuning in the human brain (e.g. for faces or scenes) is dependent on the learning diet, and best understood in the context of the full scope of experienced visual input. Broadly, we offer a unifying theoretical account where category-selective tuning naturally emerges as a consequence of positive information routing through hierarchical population codes, in order to disentangle the statistics of visual experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in mediating both fear and reward learning. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) in the BLA have previously been shown to contribute to BLA oscillatory states integral to fear expression, but whether BLA oscillatory states and PV interneurons also contribute to reward learning is unknown and critical to our understanding of reward processing. Local field potentials in the BLA were collected as animals consumed a sucrose reward, where prominent changes in the beta band (15-30 Hz) emerged with reward experience. Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons to entrain the BLA network to 20Hz during consumption of one bottle during a two bottle choice test produced a robust bottle preference. Finally, to demonstrate that PV activity is necessary for reward value use, PVs were chemogenetically targeted and inhibited following outcome devaluation, rendering those animals incapable of using updated reward value information to guide their behavior. Taken together, these experiments provide novel information regarding the physiological signatures of reward learning while highlighting the importance of PV interneurons in reward learning. This work builds upon the established knowledge in the field of PV involvement in fear expression and provides evidence that PV orchestration of unique BLA network states is involved in both learning types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many animals rely on optic flow for navigation, using differences in eye image velocity to detect deviations from their intended direction of travel. However, asymmetries in image velocity between the eyes are often overshadowed by strong, symmetric translational optic flow during navigation. Yet, the brain efficiently extracts these asymmetries for course control. While optic flow sensitive-neurons have been found in many animal species, far less is known about the postsynaptic circuits that support such robust optic flow processing. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a group of neurons called the horizontal system (HS) are involved in course control during highspeed translation. To understand how HS cells facilitate robust optic flow processing, we identified central networks that connect to HS cells using full brain electron microscopy datasets. These networks comprise three layers: convergent inputs from different, optic flow-sensitive cells, a middle layer with reciprocal, and lateral inhibitory interactions among different interneuron classes, and divergent output projecting to both the ventral nerve cord (equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord), and to deeper regions of the fly brain. By combining two-photon optical imaging to monitor free calcium dynamics, manipulating GABA receptors and modeling, we found that lateral disinhibition between brain hemispheres enhance the selectivity to rotational visual flow at the output layer of the network. Moreover, asymmetric manipulations of interneurons and their descending outputs induce drifts during highspeed walking, confirming their contribution to steering control. Together, these findings highlight the importance of competitive disinhibition as a critical circuit mechanism for robust processing of optic flow, which likely influences course control and heading perception, both critical functions supporting navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSymptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often manifest in adolescence, yet the underlying relationship between these debilitating symptoms and the development of functional brain networks is not well understood. Here we aimed to investigate how multivariate patterns of functional connectivity are associated with symptoms of BPD in a large sample of young adults and adolescents.

MethodsWe used high-quality functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults from the Human Connectome Project: Young Adults (HCP-YA; N = 870, ages 22-37 years, 457 female) and youth from the Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D; N = 223, age range 16-21 years, 121 female). A previously validated BPD proxy score was derived from the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). A ridge regression model with 10-fold cross-validation and nested hyperparameter tuning was trained and tested in HCP-YA to predict BPD scores in unseen data from regional functional connectivity, while controlling for in-scanner motion, age, and sex. The trained model was further tested on data from HCP-D without further tuning. Finally, we tested how the connectivity patterns associated with BPD aligned with agerelated changes in connectivity.

ResultsMultivariate functional connectivity patterns significantly predicted out-of-sample BPD proxy scores in unseen data in both young adults (HCP-YA; pperm = 0.001) and older adolescents (HCP-D; pperm = 0.001). Predictive capacity of regions was heterogeneous; the most predictive regions were found in functional systems relevant for emotion regulation and executive function, including the ventral attention network. Finally, regional functional connectivity patterns that predicted BPD proxy scores aligned with those associated with development in youth.

ConclusionIndividual differences in functional connectivity in developmentally-sensitive regions are associated with the symptoms of BPD.</p>
