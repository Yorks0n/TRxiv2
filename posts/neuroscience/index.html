An increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state.">

N.; Hellstrand, E.; Hammarström, P.; Nyström, S.\nScore: 2035.8, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555834\nAn increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity. Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.\nTranslocation of gut commensal bacteria to the brain\nAuthors: Thapa, M.; Kumari, A.; Chin, C.-Y.; Choby, J.; Jin, F.; Bogati, B.; Chopyk, D.; Koduri, N.; Pahnke, A.; Elrod, E.; Burd, E. M.; Weiss, D. S.; Grakoui, A.\nScore: 724.6, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555630\nThe gut-brain axis, a bidirectional signaling network between the intestine and the central nervous system, is crucial to the regulation of host physiology and inflammation. Recent advances suggest a strong correlation between gut dysbiosis and neurological diseases, however, relatively little is known about how gut bacteria impact the brain. Here, we reveal that gut commensal bacteria can translocate directly to the brain when mice are fed an altered diet that causes dysbiosis and intestinal permeability, and that this also occurs without diet alteration in distinct murine models of neurological disease. The bacteria were not found in other systemic sites or the blood, but were detected in the vagus nerve. Unilateral cervical vagotomy significantly reduced the number of bacteria in the brain, implicating the vagus nerve as a conduit for translocation. The presence of bacteria in the brain correlated with microglial activation, a marker of neuroinflammation, and with neural protein aggregation, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In at least one model, the presence of bacteria in the brain was reversible as a switch from high-fat to standard diet resulted in amelioration of intestinal permeability, led to a gradual loss of detectable bacteria in the brain, and reduced the number of neural protein aggregates. Further, in murine models of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and autism spectrum disorder, we observed gut dysbiosis, gut leakiness, bacterial translocation to the brain, and microglial activation. These data reveal a commensal bacterial translocation axis to the brain in models of diverse neurological diseases.\nA unified open-source platform for multimodal neural recording and perturbation during naturalistic behavior\nAuthors: Newman, J. P.; Zhang, J.; Cuevas-Lopez, A.; Miller, N. J.; Honda, T.; van der Goes, M.-S. H.; Leighton, A. H.; Carvalho, F.; Lopes, G.; Lakunina, A.; Siegle, J. H.; Harnett, M. T.; Wilson, M. A.; Voigts, J.\nScore: 121.3, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.554672\nBehavioral neuroscience faces two conflicting demands: long-duration recordings from large neural populations and unimpeded animal behavior. To meet this challenge, we developed ONIX, an open-source data acquisition system with high data throughput (2GB/sec) and low closed-loop latencies (\u003c1ms) that uses a novel 0.3 mm thin tether to minimize behavioral impact. Head position and rotation are tracked in 3D and used to drive active commutation without torque measurements. ONIX can acquire from combinations of passive electrodes, Neuropixels probes, head-mounted microscopes, cameras, 3D-trackers, and other data sources. We used ONIX to perform uninterrupted, long ([~]7 hours) neural recordings in mice as they traversed complex 3-dimensional terrain. ONIX allowed exploration with similar mobility as non-implanted animals, in contrast to conventional tethered systems which restricted movement. By combining long recordings with full mobility, our technology will enable new progress on questions that require high-quality neural recordings during ethologically grounded behaviors.\nThe entire brain, more or less is at work: 'Language regions' are artefacts of averaging\nAuthors: Aliko, S.; Wang, B.; Small, S. L.; Skipper, J. I.\nScore: 106.6, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555886\nModels of the neurobiology of language suggest that a small number of anatomically fixed brain regions are responsible for language functioning. This observation derives from centuries of examining brain lesions causing aphasia and is supported by decades of neuroimaging studies. The latter rely on thresholded measures of central tendency applied to activity patterns resulting from heterogeneous stimuli. We hypothesised that these methods obscure the whole brain distribution of regions supporting language. Specifically, cortical language regions and the corresponding language network consist of input regions and connectivity hubs. The latter primarily coordinate peripheral regions whose activity is variable, making them likely to be averaged out following thresholding. We tested these hypotheses in two studies using neuroimaging meta-analyses and functional magnetic resonance imaging during film watching. Both converged to suggest that averaging over heterogeneous words is localised to regions historically associated with language but distributed throughout most of the brain when not averaging over the sensorimotor properties of those words. The localised word regions are composed of highly central hubs. The film data further shows that these hubs are dynamic, connected to peripheral regions, and only appear in the aggregate across time. Results suggest that language regions are an artefact of indiscriminately averaging across heterogeneous language representations and linguistic processes. Rather, they are mostly dynamic connectivity hubs coordinating whole-brain distributions of networks for processing the complexities of real-world language use, explaining why damage to them results in aphasia.\nXylazine is an agonist at kappa opioid receptors and exhibits sex-specific responses to naloxone administration\nAuthors: Bedard, M. L.; Murray, J. G.; Huang, X.-P.; Nowlan, A. C.; Conley, S. Y.; E, M. S.; Loyack, S. J.; Cline, C. A.; Clodfelter, C. G.; Dasgupta, N.; Roth, B. L.; McElligott, Z. A.\nScore: 89.2, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556914\nXylazine has been found in the unregulated drug supply at increasing rates, usually in combination with fentanyl. It has become critical to understand its basic pharmacology, how it impacts behavior, and how it interacts with fentanyl in rodent models of opioid administration. Despite commentary from scientists, politicians, and public health officials, it is not known if xylazine impacts the efficacy of naloxone, the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression. Furthermore, few studies have examined the effects of xylazine alone, without co-administration of ketamine. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several key behaviors in male and female mice. We demonstrate differential locomotor responses by dose and sex to xylazine. Surprisingly, our results further indicate that naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and a fentanyl/xylazine combination, in both sexes, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, we show that xylazine is a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity.\nNeuronal FOS reports synchronized activity of presynaptic neurons\nAuthors: Anisimova, M.; Lamothe-Molina, P. J.; Franzelin, A.; Aberra, A. S.; Hoppa, M. B.; Gee, C. E.; Oertner, T. G.\nScore: 81.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556168\nThe immediate early gene FOS is frequently used as a marker for highly active neurons. Implicit in this use is the assumption that there is a correlation between neuronal spiking and FOS expression. Here we use optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal neurons to investigate the relation between spike frequency and FOS expression, and report several surprising observations. First, FOS expression is cell-type specific, spiking CA2 pyramidal neurons rarely express FOS. Second, FOS has a U-shaped dependence on frequency: Spiking at 0.1 Hz is more effective than high frequency spiking (50 Hz) while intermediate frequencies do not induce FOS. Third, the pathway from spiking to FOS is not cell-autonomous. Instead, transmitter release and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation are required and, at 0.1 Hz, FOS is induced independently of CREB/calcineurin/MEK pathways. We propose that FOS does not primarily encode a neurons own spike frequency but indicates repeated participation in highly synchronized activity, e.g. sharp wave ripples.\nAversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation to link memories across days\nAuthors: Zaki, Y.; Pennington, Z. T.; Morales-Rodriguez, D.; Francisco, T. R.; LaBanca, A. R.; Dong, Z.; Lamsifer, S.; Segura, S. C.; Chen, H.-t.; Christenson Wick, Z.; Silva, A. J.; van der Meer, M.; Shuman, T.; Fenton, A.; Rajan, K.; Cai, D. J.\nScore: 85.8, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.532469\nMemories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning and stabilized by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unknown. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives the offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed two days prior, linking the fear from the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. We find that fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with prior studies, we find reactivation of the recent aversive memory ensemble during the offline period following learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Taken together, these results demonstrate that strong aversive experience can drive retrospective memory-linking through the offline co-reactivation of recent memory ensembles with memory ensembles formed days prior, providing a neural mechanism by which memories can be integrated across days.\nOne-shot entorhinal maps enable flexible navigation in novel environments\nAuthors: Wen, J. H.; Sorscher, B.; Ganguli, S.; Giocomo, L.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556744\nAnimals face the substantial challenge of navigating novel environments to find food, shelter, or mates. In mammals, hexagonal grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex create a map-like population representation of the external environment. However, it remains unclear how the grid map can adapt to novel environmental features on a rapid, behaviorally relevant time scale. By recording over fifteen thousand grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we found grid cell activity was weakly anchored to landmark inputs through a fixed circuit relationship. A computational model based on this fixed circuit assumption accurately predicted grid spatial patterns in environments with novel landmark rearrangements. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that while grid cell firing patterns remain anchored to landmarks, behavior can adapt to changes in landmark location via a downstream region implementing behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity. This fixed but weak anchoring of grid cells to landmarks endows the grid map with powerful computational properties. The fixed nature allows the generation of rapid stable maps for novel environments after a single exposure. The weak nature allows these rapidly formed maps to incur only small distortions between distances traveled in real versus neural space. Overall, such rapid low distortion mapping can then mediate accurate navigational behavior in rapidly changing environments through downstream plasticity.\nNeural representational geometries correlate with behavioral differences in monkeys and recurrent neural networks\nAuthors: Fascianelli, V.; Battista, A.; Stefanini, F.; Tsujimoto, S.; Genovesio, A.; Fusi, S.\nScore: 47.5, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.05.511024\nAnimals likely use a variety of strategies to solve laboratory tasks. Traditionally, combined analysis of behavioral and neural recording data across subjects employing different strategies may obscure important signals and give confusing results. Hence, it is essential to develop techniques that can infer strategy at the single-subject level. We analyzed an experiment in which two monkeys performed a visually cued rule-based task. The analysis of their performance shows no indication that they used a different strategy. However, when we examined the geometry of stimulus representations in the state space of the neural activities recorded in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we found striking differences between the two monkeys. Our purely neural results induced us to reanalyze the behavior. The new analysis showed that the differences in representational geometry correlate with differences in the reaction times, revealing behavioral differences we were unaware of. All these analyses indicate that the monkeys are using different strategies. Finally, using recurrent neural network models trained to perform the same task, we show that these strategies correlate with the amount of training, suggesting a possible explanation for the observed neural and behavioral differences.\nControl adjustment costs limit goal flexibility: Empirical evidence and a theoretical account\nAuthors: Grahek, I.; Leng, X.; Musslick, S.; Shenhav, A.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554296\nThe ability to switch between goals is the cornerstone of human cognition and behavior. Cognitive control allows for rapid adjustments of cognition in accordance with new goals, but control adjustments come at a cost. This cost is traditionally studied in situations that demand changes to ones task, without necessitating other changes in the control state. Goal flexibility, however, often entails maintaining the same task while adjusting the amount and type of control being allocated to that task. For instance, different stages of a given task might require us to process information more or less efficiently (e.g., by varying levels of attention) and/or respond more or less cautiously (e.g., by varying response thresholds). Across four experiments, we show that such within-task control adjustments incur a performance cost, and that a dynamical systems model can explain the source of these costs. Participants performed a single cognitively demanding task (the color-word Stroop) under varying performance goals (e.g., to be fast or to be accurate). We modeled control allocation to include a dynamic process of adjusting from ones current control state to a target state for a given performance goal. By incorporating inertia into this adjustment process, our model predicts and our empirical findings confirm that people will under-shoot their target control state more (i.e., exhibit larger adjustment costs) when (a) goals switch rather than remain fixed over a block (Study 1); (b) target control states are more distant from one another (Study 2); (c) less time is given to adjust to the new goal (Study 3); and (d) when anticipating having to switch goals more frequently (Study 4). Our findings demonstrate that there is a cost to adjusting control to meet ones goal - even in the absence of a task change - and show that this cost can emerge directly from the dynamics of control adjustment. In so doing, they shed new light on the sources of and constraints on flexibility in human goal-directed behavior.\n",

        <p class="abstract">An increasing number of reports suggest an association between COVID-19 infection and initiation or acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Both these diseases and several other NDs are caused by conversion of human proteins into a misfolded, aggregated amyloid fibril state. The fibril formation process is self-perpetuating by seeded conversion from preformed fibril seeds. We recently described a plausible mechanism for amyloid fibril formation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike-protein formed amyloid fibrils upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, abundant in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection.

We here provide evidence of significant Spike-amyloid fibril seeded acceleration of amyloid formation of CJD associated human prion protein (HuPrP) using an in vitro conversion assay. By seeding the HuPrP conversion assay with other in vitro generated disease associated amyloid fibrils we demonstrate that this is not a general effect but a specific feature of spike-amyloid fibrils. We also showed that the amyloid fibril formation of AD associated A{beta}1-42 was accelerated by Spike-amyloid fibril seeds. Of seven different 20-amino acid long peptides, Spike532 (532NLVKNKCVNFNFNGLTGTGV551) was most efficient in seeding HuPrP and Spike601 (601GTNTSNQVAVLYQDVNCTEV620) was most effective in seeding A{beta}1-42, suggesting substrate dependent selectivity of the cross-seeding activity.

Albeit purely in vitro, our data suggest that cross-seeding by Spike-amyloid fibrils can be implicated in the increasing number of reports of CJD, AD, and possibly other NDs in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional signaling network between the intestine and the central nervous system, is crucial to the regulation of host physiology and inflammation. Recent advances suggest a strong correlation between gut dysbiosis and neurological diseases, however, relatively little is known about how gut bacteria impact the brain. Here, we reveal that gut commensal bacteria can translocate directly to the brain when mice are fed an altered diet that causes dysbiosis and intestinal permeability, and that this also occurs without diet alteration in distinct murine models of neurological disease. The bacteria were not found in other systemic sites or the blood, but were detected in the vagus nerve. Unilateral cervical vagotomy significantly reduced the number of bacteria in the brain, implicating the vagus nerve as a conduit for translocation. The presence of bacteria in the brain correlated with microglial activation, a marker of neuroinflammation, and with neural protein aggregation, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In at least one model, the presence of bacteria in the brain was reversible as a switch from high-fat to standard diet resulted in amelioration of intestinal permeability, led to a gradual loss of detectable bacteria in the brain, and reduced the number of neural protein aggregates. Further, in murine models of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and autism spectrum disorder, we observed gut dysbiosis, gut leakiness, bacterial translocation to the brain, and microglial activation. These data reveal a commensal bacterial translocation axis to the brain in models of diverse neurological diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Behavioral neuroscience faces two conflicting demands: long-duration recordings from large neural populations and unimpeded animal behavior. To meet this challenge, we developed ONIX, an open-source data acquisition system with high data throughput (2GB/sec) and low closed-loop latencies (&lt;1ms) that uses a novel 0.3 mm thin tether to minimize behavioral impact. Head position and rotation are tracked in 3D and used to drive active commutation without torque measurements. ONIX can acquire from combinations of passive electrodes, Neuropixels probes, head-mounted microscopes, cameras, 3D-trackers, and other data sources. We used ONIX to perform uninterrupted, long ([~]7 hours) neural recordings in mice as they traversed complex 3-dimensional terrain. ONIX allowed exploration with similar mobility as non-implanted animals, in contrast to conventional tethered systems which restricted movement. By combining long recordings with full mobility, our technology will enable new progress on questions that require high-quality neural recordings during ethologically grounded behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Models of the neurobiology of language suggest that a small number of anatomically fixed brain regions are responsible for language functioning. This observation derives from centuries of examining brain lesions causing aphasia and is supported by decades of neuroimaging studies. The latter rely on thresholded measures of central tendency applied to activity patterns resulting from heterogeneous stimuli. We hypothesised that these methods obscure the whole brain distribution of regions supporting language. Specifically, cortical  language regions and the corresponding  language network consist of input regions and connectivity hubs. The latter primarily coordinate peripheral regions whose activity is variable, making them likely to be averaged out following thresholding. We tested these hypotheses in two studies using neuroimaging meta-analyses and functional magnetic resonance imaging during film watching. Both converged to suggest that averaging over heterogeneous words is localised to regions historically associated with language but distributed throughout most of the brain when not averaging over the sensorimotor properties of those words. The localised word regions are composed of highly central hubs. The film data further shows that these hubs are dynamic, connected to peripheral regions, and only appear in the aggregate across time. Results suggest that  language regions are an artefact of indiscriminately averaging across heterogeneous language representations and linguistic processes. Rather, they are mostly dynamic connectivity hubs coordinating whole-brain distributions of networks for processing the complexities of real-world language use, explaining why damage to them results in aphasia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Xylazine has been found in the unregulated drug supply at increasing rates, usually in combination with fentanyl. It has become critical to understand its basic pharmacology, how it impacts behavior, and how it interacts with fentanyl in rodent models of opioid administration. Despite commentary from scientists, politicians, and public health officials, it is not known if xylazine impacts the efficacy of naloxone, the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression. Furthermore, few studies have examined the effects of xylazine alone, without co-administration of ketamine. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several key behaviors in male and female mice. We demonstrate differential locomotor responses by dose and sex to xylazine. Surprisingly, our results further indicate that naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and a fentanyl/xylazine combination, in both sexes, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, we show that xylazine is a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immediate early gene FOS is frequently used as a marker for highly active neurons. Implicit in this use is the assumption that there is a correlation between neuronal spiking and FOS expression. Here we use optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal neurons to investigate the relation between spike frequency and FOS expression, and report several surprising observations. First, FOS expression is cell-type specific, spiking CA2 pyramidal neurons rarely express FOS. Second, FOS has a U-shaped dependence on frequency: Spiking at 0.1 Hz is more effective than high frequency spiking (50 Hz) while intermediate frequencies do not induce FOS. Third, the pathway from spiking to FOS is not cell-autonomous. Instead, transmitter release and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation are required and, at 0.1 Hz, FOS is induced independently of CREB/calcineurin/MEK pathways. We propose that FOS does not primarily encode a neurons own spike frequency but indicates repeated participation in highly synchronized activity, e.g. sharp wave ripples.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning and stabilized by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unknown. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives the offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed two days prior, linking the fear from the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. We find that fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with prior studies, we find reactivation of the recent aversive memory ensemble during the offline period following learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Taken together, these results demonstrate that strong aversive experience can drive retrospective memory-linking through the offline co-reactivation of recent memory ensembles with memory ensembles formed days prior, providing a neural mechanism by which memories can be integrated across days.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals face the substantial challenge of navigating novel environments to find food, shelter, or mates. In mammals, hexagonal grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex create a map-like population representation of the external environment. However, it remains unclear how the grid map can adapt to novel environmental features on a rapid, behaviorally relevant time scale. By recording over fifteen thousand grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we found grid cell activity was weakly anchored to landmark inputs through a fixed circuit relationship. A computational model based on this fixed circuit assumption accurately predicted grid spatial patterns in environments with novel landmark rearrangements. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that while grid cell firing patterns remain anchored to landmarks, behavior can adapt to changes in landmark location via a downstream region implementing behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity. This fixed but weak anchoring of grid cells to landmarks endows the grid map with powerful computational properties. The fixed nature allows the generation of rapid stable maps for novel environments after a single exposure. The weak nature allows these rapidly formed maps to incur only small distortions between distances traveled in real versus neural space. Overall, such rapid low distortion mapping can then mediate accurate navigational behavior in rapidly changing environments through downstream plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals likely use a variety of strategies to solve laboratory tasks. Traditionally, combined analysis of behavioral and neural recording data across subjects employing different strategies may obscure important signals and give confusing results. Hence, it is essential to develop techniques that can infer strategy at the single-subject level. We analyzed an experiment in which two monkeys performed a visually cued rule-based task. The analysis of their performance shows no indication that they used a different strategy. However, when we examined the geometry of stimulus representations in the state space of the neural activities recorded in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we found striking differences between the two monkeys. Our purely neural results induced us to reanalyze the behavior. The new analysis showed that the differences in representational geometry correlate with differences in the reaction times, revealing behavioral differences we were unaware of. All these analyses indicate that the monkeys are using different strategies. Finally, using recurrent neural network models trained to perform the same task, we show that these strategies correlate with the amount of training, suggesting a possible explanation for the observed neural and behavioral differences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to switch between goals is the cornerstone of human cognition and behavior. Cognitive control allows for rapid adjustments of cognition in accordance with new goals, but control adjustments come at a cost. This cost is traditionally studied in situations that demand changes to ones task, without necessitating other changes in the control state. Goal flexibility, however, often entails maintaining the same task while adjusting the amount and type of control being allocated to that task. For instance, different stages of a given task might require us to process information more or less efficiently (e.g., by varying levels of attention) and/or respond more or less cautiously (e.g., by varying response thresholds). Across four experiments, we show that such within-task control adjustments incur a performance cost, and that a dynamical systems model can explain the source of these costs. Participants performed a single cognitively demanding task (the color-word Stroop) under varying performance goals (e.g., to be fast or to be accurate). We modeled control allocation to include a dynamic process of adjusting from ones current control state to a target state for a given performance goal. By incorporating inertia into this adjustment process, our model predicts and our empirical findings confirm that people will under-shoot their target control state more (i.e., exhibit larger adjustment costs) when (a) goals switch rather than remain fixed over a block (Study 1); (b) target control states are more distant from one another (Study 2); (c) less time is given to adjust to the new goal (Study 3); and (d) when anticipating having to switch goals more frequently (Study 4). Our findings demonstrate that there is a cost to adjusting control to meet ones goal - even in the absence of a task change - and show that this cost can emerge directly from the dynamics of control adjustment. In so doing, they shed new light on the sources of and constraints on flexibility in human goal-directed behavior.</p>
