However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that areas role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neurons visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouses visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given areas collection of preferred stimuli ( own-stimuli) drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas ( other-stimuli). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.\nAn output-null signature of inertial load in motor cortex\nAuthors: Kirk, E. A.; Hope, K. T.; Sober, S. J.; Sauerbrei, B. A.\nScore: 39.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565869\nCoordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.\nTranscriptional dynamics orchestrating the development and integration of neurons born in the adult hippocampus\nAuthors: Rasetto, N.

F.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565477\nThe adult hippocampus generates new granule cells (aGCs) that exhibit distinct functional capabilities along development, conveying a unique and dynamic form of plasticity to the preexisting circuits. While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like neural stem cells (RGL) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the later steps of aGC maturation remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to follow newborn neurons along their maturation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting neuronal growth, excitability and synaptogenesis. Remarkably, four discrete cellular states were defined by the expression of distinct sets of transcription factors (TFs): quiescent neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, postmitotic immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. The transition from immature to mature aCGs involved a transcriptional switch that shutdown molecular cascades promoting cell growth, such as the SoxC family of TFs, to upregulate programs controlling neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained stalled at the immature state. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms converting adult neural stem cells into functionally integrated neurons.\nFrom connectome to effectome: learning the causal interaction map of the fly brain\nAuthors: Pospisil, D. A.; Aragon, M. J.; Pillow, J. W.\nScore: 34.8, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564922\nA long-standing goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. This would allow neuroscientists to explain animal behavior in terms of the dynamic interactions between neurons. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome [1-7] specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other but not whether, or how, they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the \"effectome\". Specifically, we propose an estimator for a dynamical systems model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to accurately estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to drastically improve estimation efficiency. We then analyze the connectome to propose circuits that have the greatest total effect on the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that, fortunately, the dominant circuits significantly involve only relatively small populations of neurons--thus imaging, stimulation, and neuronal identification are feasible. Intriguingly, we find that this approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, our analyses of the connectome provide evidence that global dynamics of the fly brain are generated by a large collection of small and often anatomically localized circuits operating, largely, independently of each other. This in turn implies that a causal model of a brain, a principal goal of systems neuroscience, can be feasibly obtained in the fly.\nContexts facilitate dynamic value encoding in the mesolimbic dopamine system\nAuthors: Fraser, K. M.; Collins, V. L.; Wolff, A. R.; Ottenheimer, D. J.; Bornhoft, K. N.; Pat, F.; Chen, B. J.; Janak, P. H.; Saunders, B. T.\nScore: 30.9, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565687\nAdaptive behavior in a dynamic environment often requires rapid revaluation of stimuli that deviates from well-learned associations. The divergence between stable value-encoding and appropriate behavioral output remains a critical test to theories of dopamines function in learning, motivation, and motor control. Yet how dopamine neurons are involved in the revaluation of cues when the world changes to alter our behavior remains unclear. Here we make use of pharmacology, in vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, and optogenetics to resolve the contributions of the mesolimbic dopamine system to the dynamic reorganization of reward-seeking. Male and female rats were trained to discriminate when a conditioned stimulus would be followed by sucrose reward by exploiting the prior, non-overlapping presentation of a separate discrete cue - an occasion setter. Only when the occasion setters presentation preceded the conditioned stimulus did the conditioned stimulus predict sucrose delivery. As a result, in this task we were able to dissociate the average value of the conditioned stimulus from its immediate expected value on a trial-to-trial basis. Both the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens were essential for rats to successfully update behavioral responding in response to the occasion setter. Moreover, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens following the conditioned stimulus only occurred when the occasion setter indicated it would predict reward. Downstream of dopamine release, we found that single neurons in the nucleus accumbens dynamically tracked the value of the conditioned stimulus. Together these results reveal a novel mechanism within the mesolimbic dopamine system for the rapid revaluation of motivation.\nLarge language models implicitly learn to straighten neural sentence trajectories to construct a predictive representation of natural language\nAuthors: Hosseini, E. A.; Fedorenko, E.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.564832\nPredicting upcoming events is critical to our ability to effectively interact with our environment and conspecifics. In natural language processing, transformer models, which are trained on next-word prediction, appear to construct a general-purpose representation of language that can support diverse downstream tasks. However, we still lack an understanding of how a predictive objective shapes such representations. Inspired by recent work in vision neuroscience Henaff et al. (2019), here we test a hypothesis about predictive representations of autoregressive transformer models. In particular, we test whether the neural trajectory of a sequence of words in a sentence becomes progressively more straight as it passes through the layers of the network. The key insight behind this hypothesis is that straighter trajectories should facilitate prediction via linear extrapolation. We quantify straightness using a 1-dimensional curvature metric, and present four findings in support of the trajectory straightening hypothesis: i) In trained models, the curvature progressively decreases from the first to the middle layers of the network. ii) Models that perform better on the next-word prediction objective, including larger models and models trained on larger datasets, exhibit greater decreases in curvature, suggesting that this improved ability to straighten sentence neural trajectories may be the underlying driver of better language modeling performance. iii) Given the same linguistic context, the sequences that are generated by the model have lower curvature than the ground truth (the actual continuations observed in a language corpus), suggesting that the model favors straighter trajectories for making predictions. iv) A consistent relationship holds between the average curvature and the average surprisal of sentences in the middle layers of models, such that sentences with straighter neural trajectories also have lower surprisal. Importantly, untrained models dont exhibit these behaviors. In tandem, these results support the trajectory straightening hypothesis and provide a possible mechanism for how the geometry of the internal representations of autoregressive models supports next word prediction.\nTonically active GABAergic neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray control the initiation and execution of instinctive escape\nAuthors: Stempel, A. V.; Evans, D. A.; Pavon Arocas, O.; Claudi, F.; Lenzi, S. C.; Kutsarova, E.; Margrie, T. W.; Branco, T.\nScore: 27.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565561\nTo avoid predation, animals perform defensive actions that are both instinctive and adaptable to the environment. In mice, the decision to escape from imminent threats is implemented by a feed-forward circuit in the midbrain, where excitatory VGluT2+ neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) compute escape initiation and escape vigour from threat evidence. Here we show that GABAergic VGAT+ neurons in the dPAG dynamically control this process by modulating the excitability of excitatory escape neurons. Using in vitro patch clamp and in vivo neural activity recordings in freely behaving mice we found that VGAT+ dPAG neurons fire action potentials tonically in the absence of synaptic inputs and are a major source of synaptic inhibition to VGluT2+ dPAG neurons. Activity in these spontaneously firing VGAT+ cells transiently decreases at escape onset and increases during escape, peaking at escape termination. Optogenetically increasing or decreasing VGAT+ dPAG activity bidirectionally changes the probability of escape when the stimulation is delivered at the time of threat onset, and the duration of escape when delivered after escape initiation. We conclude that the activity of tonically firing VGAT+ dPAG neurons sets a threshold for escape initiation and controls the execution of the flight locomotor action.\nDevelopment of a high-throughput pipeline to characterize microglia morphological states at a single-cell resolution\nAuthors: Kim, J.; Pavlidis, P.; Ciernia, A. V.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565581\nAs rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We used dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states. Using ImageJ tools, we first developed a semi-automated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain subregion-specific manner. Within this pool of morphology measures, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and cell circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Furthermore, our analysis toolset captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy to use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.\nDivergent Recruitment of Developmentally-Defined Neuronal Ensembles Supports Memory Dynamics\nAuthors: Kveim, V. A.; Salm, L.; Ulmer, T.; Kandler, S.; Imhof, F.; Donato, F.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565779\nMemories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence a memory properties evolution over time. By leveraging a developmental approach to target distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we show that memory encoding results in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces are instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and follow distinct reactivation trajectories post-encoding. Notably, the divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpins memory ensembles gradual reorganization, and modulates memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and memories progression over time.\nStriatum supports fast learning but not memory recall\nAuthors: Reinhold, K.; Iadarola, M.; Tang, S.; Kuwamoto, W.; Sun, S.; Hakim, R.; Zimmer, J.; Wang, W.; Sabatini, B. L.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566333\nAnimals learn to carry out motor actions in specific sensory contexts to achieve goals. The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory-motor associations, yet its contribution to memory formation or recall is not clear. To investigate the contribution of striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with forelimb reaches to access food pellets. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short- (within an hour) or long-term (across days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in task performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding computations in the visual system requires a characterization of the distinct feature preferences of neurons in different visual cortical areas. However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that areas role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neurons visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouses visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given areas collection of preferred stimuli ( own-stimuli) drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas ( other-stimuli). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The adult hippocampus generates new granule cells (aGCs) that exhibit distinct functional capabilities along development, conveying a unique and dynamic form of plasticity to the preexisting circuits. While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like neural stem cells (RGL) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the later steps of aGC maturation remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to follow newborn neurons along their maturation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting neuronal growth, excitability and synaptogenesis. Remarkably, four discrete cellular states were defined by the expression of distinct sets of transcription factors (TFs): quiescent neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, postmitotic immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. The transition from immature to mature aCGs involved a transcriptional switch that shutdown molecular cascades promoting cell growth, such as the SoxC family of TFs, to upregulate programs controlling neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained stalled at the immature state. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms converting adult neural stem cells into functionally integrated neurons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A long-standing goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. This would allow neuroscientists to explain animal behavior in terms of the dynamic interactions between neurons. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome [1-7] specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other but not whether, or how, they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the &#34;effectome&#34;. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a dynamical systems model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to accurately estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to drastically improve estimation efficiency. We then analyze the connectome to propose circuits that have the greatest total effect on the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that, fortunately, the dominant circuits significantly involve only relatively small populations of neurons--thus imaging, stimulation, and neuronal identification are feasible. Intriguingly, we find that this approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, our analyses of the connectome provide evidence that global dynamics of the fly brain are generated by a large collection of small and often anatomically localized circuits operating, largely, independently of each other. This in turn implies that a causal model of a brain, a principal goal of systems neuroscience, can be feasibly obtained in the fly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adaptive behavior in a dynamic environment often requires rapid revaluation of stimuli that deviates from well-learned associations. The divergence between stable value-encoding and appropriate behavioral output remains a critical test to theories of dopamines function in learning, motivation, and motor control. Yet how dopamine neurons are involved in the revaluation of cues when the world changes to alter our behavior remains unclear. Here we make use of pharmacology, in vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, and optogenetics to resolve the contributions of the mesolimbic dopamine system to the dynamic reorganization of reward-seeking. Male and female rats were trained to discriminate when a conditioned stimulus would be followed by sucrose reward by exploiting the prior, non-overlapping presentation of a separate discrete cue - an occasion setter. Only when the occasion setters presentation preceded the conditioned stimulus did the conditioned stimulus predict sucrose delivery. As a result, in this task we were able to dissociate the average value of the conditioned stimulus from its immediate expected value on a trial-to-trial basis. Both the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens were essential for rats to successfully update behavioral responding in response to the occasion setter. Moreover, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens following the conditioned stimulus only occurred when the occasion setter indicated it would predict reward. Downstream of dopamine release, we found that single neurons in the nucleus accumbens dynamically tracked the value of the conditioned stimulus. Together these results reveal a novel mechanism within the mesolimbic dopamine system for the rapid revaluation of motivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predicting upcoming events is critical to our ability to effectively interact with our environment and conspecifics. In natural language processing, transformer models, which are trained on next-word prediction, appear to construct a general-purpose representation of language that can support diverse downstream tasks. However, we still lack an understanding of how a predictive objective shapes such representations. Inspired by recent work in vision neuroscience Henaff et al. (2019), here we test a hypothesis about predictive representations of autoregressive transformer models. In particular, we test whether the neural trajectory of a sequence of words in a sentence becomes progressively more straight as it passes through the layers of the network. The key insight behind this hypothesis is that straighter trajectories should facilitate prediction via linear extrapolation. We quantify straightness using a 1-dimensional curvature metric, and present four findings in support of the trajectory straightening hypothesis: i) In trained models, the curvature progressively decreases from the first to the middle layers of the network. ii) Models that perform better on the next-word prediction objective, including larger models and models trained on larger datasets, exhibit greater decreases in curvature, suggesting that this improved ability to straighten sentence neural trajectories may be the underlying driver of better language modeling performance. iii) Given the same linguistic context, the sequences that are generated by the model have lower curvature than the ground truth (the actual continuations observed in a language corpus), suggesting that the model favors straighter trajectories for making predictions. iv) A consistent relationship holds between the average curvature and the average surprisal of sentences in the middle layers of models, such that sentences with straighter neural trajectories also have lower surprisal. Importantly, untrained models dont exhibit these behaviors. In tandem, these results support the trajectory straightening hypothesis and provide a possible mechanism for how the geometry of the internal representations of autoregressive models supports next word prediction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To avoid predation, animals perform defensive actions that are both instinctive and adaptable to the environment. In mice, the decision to escape from imminent threats is implemented by a feed-forward circuit in the midbrain, where excitatory VGluT2&#43; neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) compute escape initiation and escape vigour from threat evidence. Here we show that GABAergic VGAT&#43; neurons in the dPAG dynamically control this process by modulating the excitability of excitatory escape neurons. Using in vitro patch clamp and in vivo neural activity recordings in freely behaving mice we found that VGAT&#43; dPAG neurons fire action potentials tonically in the absence of synaptic inputs and are a major source of synaptic inhibition to VGluT2&#43; dPAG neurons. Activity in these spontaneously firing VGAT&#43; cells transiently decreases at escape onset and increases during escape, peaking at escape termination. Optogenetically increasing or decreasing VGAT&#43; dPAG activity bidirectionally changes the probability of escape when the stimulation is delivered at the time of threat onset, and the duration of escape when delivered after escape initiation. We conclude that the activity of tonically firing VGAT&#43; dPAG neurons sets a threshold for escape initiation and controls the execution of the flight locomotor action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We used dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states. Using ImageJ tools, we first developed a semi-automated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain subregion-specific manner. Within this pool of morphology measures, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and cell circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Furthermore, our analysis toolset captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy to use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence a memory properties evolution over time. By leveraging a developmental approach to target distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we show that memory encoding results in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces are instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and follow distinct reactivation trajectories post-encoding. Notably, the divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpins memory ensembles gradual reorganization, and modulates memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and memories progression over time.</p>

The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory-motor associations, yet its contribution to memory formation or recall is not clear. To investigate the contribution of striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with forelimb reaches to access food pellets. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short- (within an hour) or long-term (across days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in task performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.</p>
