E.\nScore: 31.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.568932\nAstrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Astrocyte Ca2+ activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2+ responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2+ activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2+ activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.\nPIEZO2-dependent rapid pain system in humans and mice.\nAuthors: Bouchatta, O.; Brodzki, M.; Manouze, H.; Carballo, G.

S.; Szczot, M.\nScore: 30.7, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569650\nThe PIEZO2 ion channel is critical for transducing light touch into neural signals but is not considered necessary for transducing acute pain in humans. Here, we discovered an exception - a form of mechanical pain evoked by hair pulling. Based on observations in a rare group of individuals with PIEZO2 deficiency syndrome, we demonstrated that hair-pull pain is dependent on PIEZO2 transduction. Studies in control participants showed that hair-pull pain triggered a distinct nocifensive response, including a nociceptive reflex. Observations in rare A{beta} deafferented individuals and nerve conduction block studies in control participants revealed that hair-pull pain perception is dependent on A{beta} input. Single-unit axonal recordings revealed that a class of cooling-responsive myelinated nociceptors in human skin is selectively tuned to painful hair-pull stimuli. Further, we pharmacologically mapped these nociceptors to a specific transcriptomic class. Finally, using functional imaging in mice, we demonstrated that in a homologous nociceptor, Piezo2 is necessary for high-sensitivity, robust activation by hair-pull stimuli. Together, we have demonstrated that hair-pulling evokes a distinct type of pain with conserved behavioral, neural, and molecular features across humans and mice.\nFast and light efficient remote focusing for volumetric voltage imaging\nAuthors: Böhm, U. L.; Judkewitz, B.\nScore: 29.0, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568783\nVoltage imaging holds great potential for biomedical research by enabling noninvasive recording of the electrical activity of excitable cells such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Camera-based detection can record from hundreds of cells in parallel, but imaging entire volumes is limited by the need to focus through the sample at high speeds. Remote focusing techniques can remedy this drawback, but have so far been either too slow or light inefficient. Here, we introduce FLIPR, a new approach for remote focusing that doubles the light efficiency and enables high-speed volumetric voltage imaging at 500 volumes/s. We show the potential of our approach by combining it with lightsheet imaging in the zebrafish spinal cord to record from \u003e100 spontaneously active neurons in parallel.\nCapillary regression leads to sustained local hypoperfusion by inducing constriction of upstream transitional vessels\nAuthors: Bonney, S. K.; Nielson, C. D.; Sosa, M. J.; Shih, A. Y.\nScore: 43.7, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.564529\nIn the brain, a microvascular sensory web coordinates oxygen delivery to regions of neuronal activity. This involves a dense network of capillaries that send conductive signals upstream to feeding arterioles to promote vasodilation and blood flow. Although this process is critical to the metabolic supply of healthy brain tissue, it may also be a point of vulnerability in disease. Deterioration of capillary networks is a hallmark of many neurological disorders and how this web is engaged during vascular damage remains unknown. We performed in vivo two-photon microscopy on young adult mural cell reporter mice and induced focal capillary injuries using precise two-photon laser irradiation of single capillaries. We found that [~]63% of the injuries resulted in regression of the capillary segment 7-14 days following injury, and the remaining repaired to re-establish blood flow within 7 days. Injuries that resulted in capillary regression induced sustained vasoconstriction in the upstream arteriole-capillary transition (ACT) zone at least 21 days post-injury in both awake and anesthetized mice. This abnormal vasoconstriction involved attenuation of vasomotor dynamics and uncoupling from mural cell calcium signaling following capillary regression. Consequently, blood flow was reduced in the ACT zone and in secondary, uninjured downstream capillaries. These findings demonstrate how capillary injury and regression, as often seen in age-related neurological disease, can impair the microvascular sensory web and contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion. SIGNIFICANCEDeterioration of the capillary network is a characteristic of many neurological diseases and can exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration due to poor blood perfusion. Here we show that focal capillary injuries can induce vessel regression and elicit sustained vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels that branch from cortical penetrating arterioles. This reduces blood flow to broader, uninjured regions of the same microvascular network. These findings suggest that widespread and cumulative damage to brain capillaries in neurological disease may broadly affect blood supply and contribute to hypoperfusion through their remote actions.\nOscillations in an Artificial Neural Network Convert Competing Inputs into a Temporal Code\nAuthors: Duecker, K.; Idiart, M.; van Gerven, M. A.; Jensen, O.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568876\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) resemble the hierarchically organised neural representations in the primate visual ventral stream. However, these models typically disregard the temporal dynamics experimentally observed in these areas. For instance, alpha oscillations dominate the dynamics of the human visual cortex, yet the computational relevance of oscillations is rarely considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). We propose an ANN that embraces oscillatory dynamics with the computational purpose of converting simultaneous inputs, presented at two different locations, into a temporal code. The network was trained to classify three individually presented letters. Post-training, we added semi-realistic temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing relaxation dynamics in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, elucidating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activated sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model provides a novel approach for implementing multiplexing in ANNs. It further produces experimentally testable predictions of how the primate visual system handles competing stimuli.\nAdaptive stretching of representations across brain regions and deep learning model layers\nAuthors: Zhang, X.-Y.; Bobadilla-Suarez, S.; Luo, X.; Lemonari, M.; Brincat, S. L.; Siegel, M.; Miller, E. K.; Love, B. C.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569615\nPrefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to modulate the visual system to favor goal-relevant information by accentuating task-relevant stimulus dimensions. Does the brain broadly re-configures itself to optimize performance by stretching visual representations along task-relevant dimensions? We considered a task that required monkeys to selectively attend on a trial-by-trial basis to one of two dimensions (color or motion direction) to make a decision. Except for V4 (color bound) and MT (motion bound), the brain radically reconfigured itself to stretch representations along task-relevant dimensions in lateral PFC, frontal eye fields (FEF), lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), and inferotemporal cortex (IT). Spike timing was crucial to this code. A deep learning model was trained on the same visual input and rewards as the monkeys. Despite lacking an explicit selective attention or other control mechanism, the model displayed task-relevant stretching as a consequence of error minimization, indicating that stretching is an adaptive strategy.\nHigher-order connectomics of human brain function reveals local topological signatures of task decoding, individual identification, and behavior\nAuthors: Santoro, A.; Battiston, F.; Lucas, M.; Petri, G.; Amico, E.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569913\nTraditional models of human brain activity often represent it as a network of pairwise interactions between brain regions. Going beyond this limitation, recent approaches have been proposed to infer higher-order interactions from temporal brain signals involving three or more regions. However, to this day it remains unclear whether methods based on inferred higher-order interactions outperform traditional pairwise ones for the analysis of fMRI data. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using fMRI time series of 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We show that higher-order approaches greatly enhance our ability to decode dynamically between various tasks, to improve the individual identification of unimodal and transmodal functional subsystems, and to strengthen significantly the associations between brain activity and behavior. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of fMRI time series, improving the characterization of dynamic group dependencies in rest and tasks, and revealing a vast space of unexplored structures within human functional brain data, which may remain hidden when using traditional pairwise approaches.\nOptical constraints on two-photon voltage imaging\nAuthors: Davis, H.

E.\nScore: 29.6, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567441\nGenetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are a valuable tool for studying neural circuits in vivo, but the relative merits of one-photon (1P) vs. two-photon (2P) voltage imaging are not well characterized. Here we compare the photophysical and imaging properties of commonly used GEVIs under 1P and 2P excitation. 2P excitation requires [~]104-fold more illumination power per cell to produce comparable photon count rates to 1P excitation, driving a stringent tradeoff between shot noise and tissue photodamage.\nVentral hippocampal interneurons govern extinction and relapse of contextual associations\nAuthors: Lacagnina, A. F.; Dong, T. N.; Iyer, R. R.; Khan, S.; Mohamed, M. K.; Clem, R. L.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568835\nABSTRACT/SUMMARYContextual associations are critical for survival but must be extinguished when new conditions render them nonproductive. By most accounts, extinction forms a new memory that competes with the original association for control over behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this competition remain largely enigmatic. Here we find the retrieval of contextual fear conditioning and extinction yield contrasting patterns of activity in prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. Within ventral CA1, activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) occurs preferentially during extinction retrieval and correlates with differences in input synaptic transmission. Optogenetic manipulation of these cells but not parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) elicits bidirectional changes in fear expression following extinction, and the ability of SST-INs to gate fear is specific to the context in which extinction was acquired. A similar pattern of results was obtained following reward-based extinction. These data show that ventral hippocampal SST-INs are critical for extinguishing prior associations and thereby gate relapse of both aversive and appetitive responses.\nContentopic mapping in ventral and dorsal association cortex: the topographical organization of manipulable object information\nAuthors: Almeida, J.; Kristensen, S.; Tal, Z.; Fracasso, A.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.568856\nUnderstanding how object information is neurally organized is fundamental to unravel object recognition1-4. The best-known neural organizational principle of information is topographical mapping of specific dimensions. Such maps have been shown mainly for sensorimotor information within sensorimotor cortices (e.g., retinotopy)5-9. Thus, here we ask whether there are topographic maps - by analogy, contentopic maps - for mid-level object-related dimensions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and population receptive field analysis7 to measure tuning of neural populations to selected manipulable object-related dimensions. Here we show maps in dorsal and ventral occipital cortex that code for the score of each object on each target dimension in a linear progression following a particular direction along the cortical surface. Maps for each dimension are distinct, and consistent across individuals. Thus, object information is coded in multiple topographical maps - i.e., contentopic maps. These contentopic maps refer to intermediate level visual and visuomotor representations, and are potentially computed from the grouping of lower-level information through non-linear transformation following gestalt principles4,10. This shows that topography is a widespread and non-incidental strategy for the organization of information in the brain that leads to greatly reduced connectivity-related metabolic costs and fast and efficient readouts of information for stimuli discrimination11,12.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Astrocytes--the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain--are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity via calcium (Ca2&#43;) signaling. Astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales: from fast, subcellular activity to slow, synchronized activity that travels across connected astrocyte networks. Furthermore, astrocyte network activity has been shown to influence a wide range of processes. While astrocyte network activity has important implications for neuronal circuit function, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon Ca2&#43; imaging of astrocytes while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2&#43; responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2&#43; activity--propagative events--differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two major neurotransmitters, and gates responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over the course of minutes, contributing to accumulating evidence across multiple model organisms that significant astrocyte-neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future studies investigating the link between specific astrocyte Ca2&#43; activity and specific astrocyte functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The PIEZO2 ion channel is critical for transducing light touch into neural signals but is not considered necessary for transducing acute pain in humans. Here, we discovered an exception - a form of mechanical pain evoked by hair pulling. Based on observations in a rare group of individuals with PIEZO2 deficiency syndrome, we demonstrated that hair-pull pain is dependent on PIEZO2 transduction. Studies in control participants showed that hair-pull pain triggered a distinct nocifensive response, including a nociceptive reflex. Observations in rare A{beta} deafferented individuals and nerve conduction block studies in control participants revealed that hair-pull pain perception is dependent on A{beta} input. Single-unit axonal recordings revealed that a class of cooling-responsive myelinated nociceptors in human skin is selectively tuned to painful hair-pull stimuli. Further, we pharmacologically mapped these nociceptors to a specific transcriptomic class. Finally, using functional imaging in mice, we demonstrated that in a homologous nociceptor, Piezo2 is necessary for high-sensitivity, robust activation by hair-pull stimuli. Together, we have demonstrated that hair-pulling evokes a distinct type of pain with conserved behavioral, neural, and molecular features across humans and mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Voltage imaging holds great potential for biomedical research by enabling noninvasive recording of the electrical activity of excitable cells such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Camera-based detection can record from hundreds of cells in parallel, but imaging entire volumes is limited by the need to focus through the sample at high speeds. Remote focusing techniques can remedy this drawback, but have so far been either too slow or light inefficient. Here, we introduce FLIPR, a new approach for remote focusing that doubles the light efficiency and enables high-speed volumetric voltage imaging at 500 volumes/s. We show the potential of our approach by combining it with lightsheet imaging in the zebrafish spinal cord to record from &gt;100 spontaneously active neurons in parallel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the brain, a microvascular sensory web coordinates oxygen delivery to regions of neuronal activity. This involves a dense network of capillaries that send conductive signals upstream to feeding arterioles to promote vasodilation and blood flow. Although this process is critical to the metabolic supply of healthy brain tissue, it may also be a point of vulnerability in disease. Deterioration of capillary networks is a hallmark of many neurological disorders and how this web is engaged during vascular damage remains unknown. We performed in vivo two-photon microscopy on young adult mural cell reporter mice and induced focal capillary injuries using precise two-photon laser irradiation of single capillaries. We found that [~]63% of the injuries resulted in regression of the capillary segment 7-14 days following injury, and the remaining repaired to re-establish blood flow within 7 days. Injuries that resulted in capillary regression induced sustained vasoconstriction in the upstream arteriole-capillary transition (ACT) zone at least 21 days post-injury in both awake and anesthetized mice. This abnormal vasoconstriction involved attenuation of vasomotor dynamics and uncoupling from mural cell calcium signaling following capillary regression. Consequently, blood flow was reduced in the ACT zone and in secondary, uninjured downstream capillaries. These findings demonstrate how capillary injury and regression, as often seen in age-related neurological disease, can impair the microvascular sensory web and contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion.

SIGNIFICANCEDeterioration of the capillary network is a characteristic of many neurological diseases and can exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration due to poor blood perfusion. Here we show that focal capillary injuries can induce vessel regression and elicit sustained vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels that branch from cortical penetrating arterioles. This reduces blood flow to broader, uninjured regions of the same microvascular network. These findings suggest that widespread and cumulative damage to brain capillaries in neurological disease may broadly affect blood supply and contribute to hypoperfusion through their remote actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) resemble the hierarchically organised neural representations in the primate visual ventral stream. However, these models typically disregard the temporal dynamics experimentally observed in these areas. For instance, alpha oscillations dominate the dynamics of the human visual cortex, yet the computational relevance of oscillations is rarely considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). We propose an ANN that embraces oscillatory dynamics with the computational purpose of converting simultaneous inputs, presented at two different locations, into a temporal code. The network was trained to classify three individually presented letters. Post-training, we added semi-realistic temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing relaxation dynamics in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, elucidating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activated sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model provides a novel approach for implementing multiplexing in ANNs. It further produces experimentally testable predictions of how the primate visual system handles competing stimuli.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to modulate the visual system to favor goal-relevant information by accentuating task-relevant stimulus dimensions. Does the brain broadly re-configures itself to optimize performance by stretching visual representations along task-relevant dimensions? We considered a task that required monkeys to selectively attend on a trial-by-trial basis to one of two dimensions (color or motion direction) to make a decision. Except for V4 (color bound) and MT (motion bound), the brain radically reconfigured itself to stretch representations along task-relevant dimensions in lateral PFC, frontal eye fields (FEF), lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), and inferotemporal cortex (IT). Spike timing was crucial to this code. A deep learning model was trained on the same visual input and rewards as the monkeys. Despite lacking an explicit selective attention or other control mechanism, the model displayed task-relevant stretching as a consequence of error minimization, indicating that stretching is an adaptive strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traditional models of human brain activity often represent it as a network of pairwise interactions between brain regions. Going beyond this limitation, recent approaches have been proposed to infer higher-order interactions from temporal brain signals involving three or more regions. However, to this day it remains unclear whether methods based on inferred higher-order interactions outperform traditional pairwise ones for the analysis of fMRI data. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using fMRI time series of 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We show that higher-order approaches greatly enhance our ability to decode dynamically between various tasks, to improve the individual identification of unimodal and transmodal functional subsystems, and to strengthen significantly the associations between brain activity and behavior. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of fMRI time series, improving the characterization of dynamic group dependencies in rest and tasks, and revealing a vast space of unexplored structures within human functional brain data, which may remain hidden when using traditional pairwise approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT/SUMMARYContextual associations are critical for survival but must be extinguished when new conditions render them nonproductive. By most accounts, extinction forms a new memory that competes with the original association for control over behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this competition remain largely enigmatic. Here we find the retrieval of contextual fear conditioning and extinction yield contrasting patterns of activity in prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. Within ventral CA1, activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) occurs preferentially during extinction retrieval and correlates with differences in input synaptic transmission. Optogenetic manipulation of these cells but not parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) elicits bidirectional changes in fear expression following extinction, and the ability of SST-INs to gate fear is specific to the context in which extinction was acquired. A similar pattern of results was obtained following reward-based extinction. These data show that ventral hippocampal SST-INs are critical for extinguishing prior associations and thereby gate relapse of both aversive and appetitive responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how object information is neurally organized is fundamental to unravel object recognition1-4. The best-known neural organizational principle of information is topographical mapping of specific dimensions. Such maps have been shown mainly for sensorimotor information within sensorimotor cortices (e.g., retinotopy)5-9. Thus, here we ask whether there are topographic maps - by analogy, contentopic maps - for mid-level object-related dimensions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and population receptive field analysis7 to measure tuning of neural populations to selected manipulable object-related dimensions. Here we show maps in dorsal and ventral occipital cortex that code for the score of each object on each target dimension in a linear progression following a particular direction along the cortical surface. Maps for each dimension are distinct, and consistent across individuals. Thus, object information is coded in multiple topographical maps - i.e., contentopic maps. These contentopic maps refer to intermediate level visual and visuomotor representations, and are potentially computed from the grouping of lower-level information through non-linear transformation following gestalt principles4,10. This shows that topography is a widespread and non-incidental strategy for the organization of information in the brain that leads to greatly reduced connectivity-related metabolic costs and fast and efficient readouts of information for stimuli discrimination11,12.</p>
