Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.

However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that area's role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neuron's visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouse's visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given area's collection of preferred stimuli ('own-stimuli') drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas ('other-stimuli'). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.\nMulti-region calcium imaging in freely behaving mice with ultra-compact head-mounted fluorescence microscopes\nAuthors: Xue, F.; Li, F.; Zhang, K.-m.; Ding, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, X.; Xu, F.; Zhang, D.; Sun, M.; Lau, P.-M.; Zhu, Q.; Zhou, P.; Bi, G.-Q.\nScore: 42.3, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564709\nTo investigate the circuit-level neural mechanisms of behavior, simultaneous imaging of neuronal activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions is highly desired. Miniature head-mounted microscopes offer the capability of calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, implanting multiple microscopes on a mouse brain remains challenging due to space constraints and the cumbersome weight of equipment. Here, we present TINIscope, a Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Proof-of-concept experiments with TINIscope recorded over 1000 neurons in four hippocampal subregions and revealed concurrent activity patterns spanning across these regions. Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.\n\"The Brain is...\": A Survey of The Brain's Many Definitions\nAuthors: Bolt, T. S.; Uddin, L.\nScore: 39.4, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564205\nA reader of the peer-reviewed neuroscience literature will often encounter expressions like the following: the brain is a dynamic system, the brain is a complex network, or the brain is a highly metabolic organ. These expressions attempt to define the essential functions and properties of the mammalian or human brain in a simple phrase or sentence, sometimes using metaphors. We sought to survey the most common phrases of the form the brain is... in the biomedical literature to provide insights into current conceptualizations of the brain . Utilizing text analytic tools applied to a large sample of peer-reviewed full-text articles and abstracts, we extracted several thousand phrases of the form the brain is... and identified over a dozen frequently appearing phrases. The most used phrases included metaphors (e.g., the brain as a information processor or prediction machine) and descriptions of essential functions (e.g., a central organ of stress adaptation) or properties (e.g., a highly vascularized organ). The results of our analysis underscore the diversity of qualities and functions commonly attributed to the brain in the biomedical literature and suggest a range of conceptualizations that defy unification.\nNeuroinflammation in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) as assessed by PBR28 PET correlates with vascular disease measures\nAuthors: VanElzakker, M. B.; Bues, H. F.; Brusaferri, L.; Kim, M.; Saadi, D.; Ratai, E.-M.; Dougherty, D. D.; Loggia, M. L.\nScore: 1065.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563117\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.\nFrom connectome to effectome: learning the causal interaction map of the fly brain\nAuthors: Pospisil, D. A.; Aragon, M. J.; Pillow, J. W.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564922\nA long-standing goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. This would allow neuroscientists to explain animal behavior in terms of the dynamic interactions between neurons. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome [1-7] specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other but not whether, or how, they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the \"effectome\". Specifically, we propose an estimator for a dynamical systems model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to accurately estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to drastically improve estimation efficiency. We then analyze the connectome to propose circuits that have the greatest total effect on the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that, fortunately, the dominant circuits significantly involve only relatively small populations of neurons--thus imaging, stimulation, and neuronal identification are feasible. Intriguingly, we find that this approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, our analyses of the connectome provide evidence that global dynamics of the fly brain are generated by a large collection of small and often anatomically localized circuits operating, largely, independently of each other. This in turn implies that a causal model of a brain, a principal goal of systems neuroscience, can be feasibly obtained in the fly.\nContexts facilitate dynamic value encoding in the mesolimbic dopamine system\nAuthors: Fraser, K. M.; Collins, V. L.; Wolff, A. R.; Ottenheimer, D. J.; Bornhoft, K. N.; Pat, F.; Chen, B. J.; Janak, P. H.; Saunders, B. T.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565687\nAdaptive behavior in a dynamic environment often requires rapid revaluation of stimuli that deviates from well-learned associations. The divergence between stable value-encoding and appropriate behavioral output remains a critical test to theories of dopamine's function in learning, motivation, and motor control. Yet how dopamine neurons are involved in the revaluation of cues when the world changes to alter our behavior remains unclear. Here we make use of pharmacology, in vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, and optogenetics to resolve the contributions of the mesolimbic dopamine system to the dynamic reorganization of reward-seeking. Male and female rats were trained to discriminate when a conditioned stimulus would be followed by sucrose reward by exploiting the prior, non-overlapping presentation of a separate discrete cue - an occasion setter. Only when the occasion setter's presentation preceded the conditioned stimulus did the conditioned stimulus predict sucrose delivery. As a result, in this task we were able to dissociate the average value of the conditioned stimulus from its immediate expected value on a trial-to-trial basis. Both the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens were essential for rats to successfully update behavioral responding in response to the occasion setter. Moreover, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens following the conditioned stimulus only occurred when the occasion setter indicated it would predict reward. Downstream of dopamine release, we found that single neurons in the nucleus accumbens dynamically tracked the value of the conditioned stimulus. Together these results reveal a novel mechanism within the mesolimbic dopamine system for the rapid revaluation of motivation.\nTranscriptional dynamics orchestrating the development and integration of neurons born in the adult hippocampus\nAuthors: Rasetto, N. B.; Giacomini, D.; Berardino, A. A.; Vega Waichman, T.; Beckel, M. S.; Di Bella, D. J.; Brown, J.; Davies-Sala, M. G.; Gerhardinger, C.; Lie, D. C.; Arlotta, P.; Chernomoretz, A.; Schinder, A. F.\nScore: 28.5, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565477\nThe adult hippocampus generates new granule cells (aGCs) that exhibit distinct functional capabilities along development, conveying a unique and dynamic form of plasticity to the preexisting circuits. While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like neural stem cells (RGL) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the later steps of aGC maturation remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to follow newborn neurons along their maturation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting neuronal growth, excitability and synaptogenesis. Remarkably, four discrete cellular states were defined by the expression of distinct sets of transcription factors (TFs): quiescent neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, postmitotic immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. The transition from immature to mature aCGs involved a transcriptional switch that shutdown molecular cascades promoting cell growth, such as the SoxC family of TFs, to upregulate programs controlling neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained stalled at the immature state. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms converting adult neural stem cells into functionally integrated neurons.\nRobust reprogramming of glia into neurons by inhibition of Notch signaling and NFI factors in adult mammalian retina.\nAuthors: Le, N.; Vu, T.-D.; Palazzo, I.; Pulya, R.; Kim, Y.; Blackshaw, S.; Hoang, T.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.560483\nGeneration of neurons through direct reprogramming has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite successful applications in vitro, in vivo implementation has been hampered by low efficiency. In this study, we present a highly efficient approach for reprogramming retinal glial cells into neurons by simultaneously inhibiting key negative regulators. By suppressing Notch signaling through the removal of its central mediator Rbpj, we induced mature Muller glial cells to reprogram into bipolar and amacrine neurons in uninjured adult mouse retinas and observed that this effect was further enhanced by retinal injury. We found that specific loss of function of Notch1 and Notch2 receptors in Muller glia mimicked the effect of Rbpj deletion on Muller glia-derived neurogenesis. Integrated multiomic and CUT\u0026Tag analysis revealed that Rbpj directly activates Notch effector genes and genes specific to mature Muller glia while also indirectly represses the expression of neurogenic bHLH factors. Furthermore, we found that combined loss of function of Rbpj and Nfia/b/x resulted in a robust conversion of nearly all Muller glia to neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that inducing Muller glial proliferation by AAV-mediated overexpression of dominant-active Yap supports efficient levels of Muller glia-derived neurogenesis in both Rbpj- and Nfia/b/x/Rbpj-deficient Muller glia. These findings demonstrate that, much like in zebrafish, Notch signaling actively represses neurogenic competence in mammalian Muller glia and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling and Nfia/b/x in combination with overexpression of activated Yap could serve as an effective component of regenerative therapies for degenerative retinal diseases.

A.; Hope, K. T.; Sober, S. J.; Sauerbrei, B. A.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565869\nCoordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent evidence suggests that myelin lipids may act as glial energy reserves when glucose is lacking, a hypothesis yet to be solidly proven. Hereby, we examined the effects of running a marathon on the myelin content by MRI. Our findings show that marathon runners undergo widespread robust myelin decrease at completion of the effort. This reduction involves white and gray matter, and includes primary motor and sensory cortical areas and pathways, as well as the entire corpus callosum and internal capsule. Notably, myelin levels partially recover within two weeks after the marathon. These results reveal that myelin use and replenishment is an unprecedented form of metabolic plasticity aimed to maintain brain function during extreme conditions.

        <p class="abstract">Understanding computations in the visual system requires a characterization of the distinct feature preferences of neurons in different visual cortical areas. However, we know little about how feature preferences of neurons within a given area relate to that area&#39;s role within the global organization of visual cortex. To address this, we recorded from thousands of neurons across six visual cortical areas in mouse and leveraged generative AI methods combined with closed-loop neuronal recordings to identify each neuron&#39;s visual feature preference. First, we discovered that the mouse&#39;s visual system is globally organized to encode features in a manner invariant to the types of image transformations induced by self-motion. Second, we found differences in the visual feature preferences of each area and that these differences generalized across animals. Finally, we observed that a given area&#39;s collection of preferred stimuli (&#39;own-stimuli&#39;) drive neurons from the same area more effectively through their dynamic range compared to preferred stimuli from other areas (&#39;other-stimuli&#39;). As a result, feature preferences of neurons within an area are organized to maximally encode differences among own-stimuli while remaining insensitive to differences among other-stimuli. These results reveal how visual areas work together to efficiently encode information about the external world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To investigate the circuit-level neural mechanisms of behavior, simultaneous imaging of neuronal activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions is highly desired. Miniature head-mounted microscopes offer the capability of calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, implanting multiple microscopes on a mouse brain remains challenging due to space constraints and the cumbersome weight of equipment. Here, we present TINIscope, a Tightly Integrated Neuronal Imaging microscope optimized for electronic and opto-mechanical design. With its compact and lightweight design of 0.43 g, TINIscope enables unprecedented simultaneous imaging of behavior-relevant activity in up to four brain regions in mice. Proof-of-concept experiments with TINIscope recorded over 1000 neurons in four hippocampal subregions and revealed concurrent activity patterns spanning across these regions. Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A reader of the peer-reviewed neuroscience literature will often encounter expressions like the following:  the brain is a dynamic system,  the brain is a complex network, or  the brain is a highly metabolic organ. These expressions attempt to define the essential functions and properties of the mammalian or human brain in a simple phrase or sentence, sometimes using metaphors. We sought to survey the most common phrases of the form  the brain is... in the biomedical literature to provide insights into current conceptualizations of the brain . Utilizing text analytic tools applied to a large sample of peer-reviewed full-text articles and abstracts, we extracted several thousand phrases of the form  the brain is... and identified over a dozen frequently appearing phrases. The most used phrases included metaphors (e.g., the brain as a  information processor or  prediction machine) and descriptions of essential functions (e.g.,  a central organ of stress adaptation) or properties (e.g.,  a highly vascularized organ). The results of our analysis underscore the diversity of qualities and functions commonly attributed to the brain in the biomedical literature and suggest a range of conceptualizations that defy unification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a consequential public health crisis of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), sometimes referred to as long COVID. The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A long-standing goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. This would allow neuroscientists to explain animal behavior in terms of the dynamic interactions between neurons. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome [1-7] specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other but not whether, or how, they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the &#34;effectome&#34;. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a dynamical systems model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to accurately estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to drastically improve estimation efficiency. We then analyze the connectome to propose circuits that have the greatest total effect on the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that, fortunately, the dominant circuits significantly involve only relatively small populations of neurons--thus imaging, stimulation, and neuronal identification are feasible. Intriguingly, we find that this approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, our analyses of the connectome provide evidence that global dynamics of the fly brain are generated by a large collection of small and often anatomically localized circuits operating, largely, independently of each other. This in turn implies that a causal model of a brain, a principal goal of systems neuroscience, can be feasibly obtained in the fly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adaptive behavior in a dynamic environment often requires rapid revaluation of stimuli that deviates from well-learned associations. The divergence between stable value-encoding and appropriate behavioral output remains a critical test to theories of dopamine&#39;s function in learning, motivation, and motor control. Yet how dopamine neurons are involved in the revaluation of cues when the world changes to alter our behavior remains unclear. Here we make use of pharmacology, in vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, and optogenetics to resolve the contributions of the mesolimbic dopamine system to the dynamic reorganization of reward-seeking. Male and female rats were trained to discriminate when a conditioned stimulus would be followed by sucrose reward by exploiting the prior, non-overlapping presentation of a separate discrete cue - an occasion setter. Only when the occasion setter&#39;s presentation preceded the conditioned stimulus did the conditioned stimulus predict sucrose delivery. As a result, in this task we were able to dissociate the average value of the conditioned stimulus from its immediate expected value on a trial-to-trial basis. Both the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens were essential for rats to successfully update behavioral responding in response to the occasion setter. Moreover, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens following the conditioned stimulus only occurred when the occasion setter indicated it would predict reward. Downstream of dopamine release, we found that single neurons in the nucleus accumbens dynamically tracked the value of the conditioned stimulus. Together these results reveal a novel mechanism within the mesolimbic dopamine system for the rapid revaluation of motivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The adult hippocampus generates new granule cells (aGCs) that exhibit distinct functional capabilities along development, conveying a unique and dynamic form of plasticity to the preexisting circuits. While early differentiation of adult radial glia-like neural stem cells (RGL) has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms guiding the later steps of aGC maturation remain unknown. Here, we used a precise birthdating strategy to follow newborn neurons along their maturation using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Transcriptional profiling revealed a continuous trajectory from RGLs to mature aGCs, with multiple immature stages bearing increasing levels of effector genes supporting neuronal growth, excitability and synaptogenesis. Remarkably, four discrete cellular states were defined by the expression of distinct sets of transcription factors (TFs): quiescent neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, postmitotic immature aGCs, and mature aGCs. The transition from immature to mature aCGs involved a transcriptional switch that shutdown molecular cascades promoting cell growth, such as the SoxC family of TFs, to upregulate programs controlling neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, aGCs overexpressing Sox4 or Sox11 remained stalled at the immature state. Our results unveil precise molecular mechanisms converting adult neural stem cells into functionally integrated neurons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Generation of neurons through direct reprogramming has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite successful applications in vitro, in vivo implementation has been hampered by low efficiency. In this study, we present a highly efficient approach for reprogramming retinal glial cells into neurons by simultaneously inhibiting key negative regulators. By suppressing Notch signaling through the removal of its central mediator Rbpj, we induced mature Muller glial cells to reprogram into bipolar and amacrine neurons in uninjured adult mouse retinas and observed that this effect was further enhanced by retinal injury. We found that specific loss of function of Notch1 and Notch2 receptors in Muller glia mimicked the effect of Rbpj deletion on Muller glia-derived neurogenesis. Integrated multiomic and CUT&amp;Tag analysis revealed that Rbpj directly activates Notch effector genes and genes specific to mature Muller glia while also indirectly represses the expression of neurogenic bHLH factors. Furthermore, we found that combined loss of function of Rbpj and Nfia/b/x resulted in a robust conversion of nearly all Muller glia to neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that inducing Muller glial proliferation by AAV-mediated overexpression of dominant-active Yap supports efficient levels of Muller glia-derived neurogenesis in both Rbpj- and Nfia/b/x/Rbpj-deficient Muller glia. These findings demonstrate that, much like in zebrafish, Notch signaling actively represses neurogenic competence in mammalian Muller glia and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling and Nfia/b/x in combination with overexpression of activated Yap could serve as an effective component of regenerative therapies for degenerative retinal diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Coordinated movement requires the nervous system to continuously compensate for changes in mechanical load across different contexts. For voluntary movements like reaching, the motor cortex is a critical hub that generates commands to move the limbs and counteract loads. How does cortex contribute to load compensation when rhythmic movements are clocked by a spinal pattern generator? Here, we address this question by manipulating the mass of the forelimb in unrestrained mice during locomotion. While load produces changes in motor output that are robust to inactivation of motor cortex, it also induces a profound shift in cortical dynamics, which is minimally affected by cerebellar perturbation and significantly larger than the response in the spinal motoneuron population. This latent representation may enable motor cortex to generate appropriate commands when a voluntary movement must be integrated with an ongoing, spinally-generated rhythm.</p>
