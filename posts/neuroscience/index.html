Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified1-6. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.\nStandardised Measurements for Monitoring and Comparing Multiphoton Microscope Systems\nAuthors: Lees, R.

M.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576417\nThe goal of this protocol is to enable better characterisation of multiphoton microscopy hardware across a large user base. The scope of this protocol is purposefully limited to focus on hardware, touching on software and data analysis routines only where relevant. The intended audiences are scientists using and building multiphoton microscopes in their laboratories. The goal is that any scientist, not only those with optical expertise, can test whether their multiphoton microscope is performing well and producing consistent data over the lifetime of their system.\nEmergence of neocortical function in heterotopic neurons\nAuthors: Roig-Puiggros, S.; Guyoton, M.; Suchkov, D.; Fortoul, A.; Fievre, S.; Matteucci, G.; Maino, E.; Foucher, C. G.; Fuciec, D.; Klingler, E.; Francis, F.; Minlebaev, M.; El-Boustani, S.; Watrin, F.; Manent, J.-B.; Jabaudon, D.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576031\nBrains come in various sizes and shapes, yet how neuronal position constrains the type of circuits that they can form remains largely unknown. The spatial layout of anatomical structures with corresponding functions varies widely across species (J-4). Also, during evolution, anatomical structures have duplicated and then diverged to generate new circuits and functions (5, 6). Thus, it is critical to understand how the position of neurons constrains their integration into circuits and, ultimately, their function. To address this question, we studied EmlJ knockout mice in which subsets of neocortical neurons form a new structure below the neocortex termed heterotopia (Ht). We examined how this new location affects the molecular identity, topography, input-output circuit connectivity, electrophysiology, and functional properties of these neurons. Our results reveal a striking conservation of the cellular features and circuit properties of Ht neurons, despite their abnormal location and misorientation. Supporting this observation, these neurons were able to functionally substitute for overlying neocortical neurons in a behaviorally relevant task when the latter were optogenetically silenced. Hence, specific neuronal identities and associated function can be reproduced in altered anatomical settings, revealing a remarkable level of self-organization and adaptability of neocortical circuits.\nDimensions of early life adversity are differentially associated with patterns of delayed and accelerated brain maturation\nAuthors: Beck, D.; Whitmore, L.; MacSweeney, N.; Brieant, A.; Karl, V.; de Lange, A.-M. G.; Westlye, L. T.; Mills, K. L.; Tamnes, C. K.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576780\nDifferent types of early-life adversity have been associated with childrens brain structure and function. However, understanding the disparate influence of distinct adversity exposures on the developing brain remains a major challenge. This study investigates the neural correlates of 10 robust dimensions of early-life adversity identified through exploratory factor analysis in a large community sample of youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Brain age models were trained, validated, and tested separately on T1- weighted (T1; N = 9524), diffusion tensor (DTI; N = 8834), and resting-state functional (rs- fMRI; N = 8233) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from two time points (mean age = 10.7 years, SD = 1.2, range = 8.9-13.8 years). Bayesian multilevel modelling supported distinct associations between different types of early-life adversity exposures and younger- and older-looking brains. Dimensions generally related to emotional neglect, such as lack of primary and secondary caregiver support, and lack of caregiver supervision, were associated with lower brain age gaps (BAGs), i.e., younger-looking brains. In contrast, dimensions generally related to caregiver psychopathology, trauma exposure, family aggression, substance use and separation from biological parent, and socio-economic disadvantage and neighbourhood safety were associated with higher BAGs, i.e., older-looking brains. The findings suggest that dimensions of early-life adversity are differentially associated with distinct neurodevelopmental patterns, indicative of dimension-specific delayed and accelerated brain maturation.\nTDP-43 loss induces extensive cryptic polyadenylation in ALS/FTD\nAuthors: Bryce-Smith, S.; Brown, A.-L.; Mehta, P.

A key consequence of TDP-43 nuclear loss is the de-repression of cryptic exons. Whilst TDP-43 regulated cryptic splicing is increasingly well catalogued, cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, which define the 3 end of last exons, have been largely overlooked, especially when not associated with novel upstream splice junctions. We developed a novel bioinformatic approach to reliably identify distinct APA event types: alternative last exons (ALE), 3UTR extensions (3Ext) and intronic polyadenylation (IPA) events. We identified novel neuronal cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss of function by systematically applying our pipeline to a compendium of publicly available and in house datasets. We find that TDP-43 binding sites and target motifs are enriched at these cryptic events and that TDP-43 can have both repressive and enhancing action on APA. Importantly, all categories of cryptic APA can also be identified in ALS and FTD post mortem brain regions with TDP-43 proteinopathy underlining their potential disease relevance. RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses indicate that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript and translation. Intriguingly, cryptic 3Exts occur in multiple transcription factors, such as ELK1, SIX3, and TLX1, and lead to an increase in wild-type protein levels and function. Finally, we show that an increase in RNA stability leading to a higher cytoplasmic localisation underlies these observations. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces a novel category of cryptic RNA processing events and we expand the palette of TDP-43 loss consequences by showing this can also lead to an increase in normal protein translation.\nDisuse-driven plasticity in the human thalamus and putamen\nAuthors: Chauvin, R.

F.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566031\nMotor adaptation in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops has been studied mainly in animals using invasive electrophysiology. Here, we leverage functional neuroimaging in humans to study motor circuit plasticity in the human subcortex. We employed an experimental paradigm that combined two weeks of upper-extremity immobilization with daily resting-state and motor task fMRI before, during, and after the casting period. We previously showed that limb disuse leads to decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the contralateral somatomotor cortex (SM1) with the ipsilateral somatomotor cortex, increased FC with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) as well as the emergence of high amplitude, fMRI signal pulses localized in the contralateral SM1, supplementary motor area and the cerebellum. From our prior observations, it remains unclear whether the disuse plasticity affects the thalamus and striatum. We extended our analysis to include these subcortical regions and found that both exhibit strengthened cortical FC and spontaneous fMRI signal pulses induced by limb disuse. The dorsal posterior putamen and the central thalamus, mainly CM, VLP and VIM nuclei, showed disuse pulses and FC changes that lined up with fmri task activations from the Human connectome project motor system localizer, acquired before casting for each participant. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops in human motor plasticity and a potential link with the physiology of sleep regulation. Additionally, similarities with FC observation from Parkinson Disease (PD) questions a pathophysiological link with limb disuse.\nFrontal noradrenergic and cholinergic transients exhibit distinct spatiotemporal dynamics during competitive decision-making\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Ortega, H. K.; Kelly, E. B.; Indajang, J.; Feng, J.; Li, Y.; Kwan, A. C.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576893\nNorepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) are neuromodulators that are crucial for learning and decision-making. In the cortex, NE and ACh are released at specific sites along neuromodulatory axons, which would constrain their spatiotemporal dynamics at the subcellular scale. However, how the fluctuating patterns of NE and ACh signaling may be linked to behavioral events is unknown. Here, leveraging genetically encoded NE and ACh indicators, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the superficial layer of the mouse medial frontal cortex during decision-making. Head-fixed mice engage in a competitive game called matching pennies against a computer opponent. We show that both NE and ACh transients carry information about decision-related variables including choice, outcome, and reinforcer. However, the two neuromodulators differ in their spatiotemporal pattern of task-related activation. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, using optogenetics we found that evoked elevation of NE, but not ACh, in the medial frontal cortex increases the propensity of the animals to switch and explore alternate options. Taken together, the results reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns of rapid ACh and NE transients at the subcellular scale during decision-making in mice, which may endow these neuromodulators with different ways to impact neural plasticity to mediate learning and adaptive behavior.\nTDP-43 nuclear loss in FTD/ALS causes widespread alternative polyadenylation changes\nAuthors: Zeng, Y.; Lovchykova, A.; Aikyama, T.; Liu, C.; Guo, C.; Jawahar, V.

TDP-43 loss leads to cryptic exon inclusion but a role in other RNA processing events remains unresolved. Here, we show that loss of TDP-43 causes widespread changes in alternative polyadenylation, impacting expression of disease-relevant genes (e.g., ELP1, NEFL, and TMEM106B) and providing evidence that alternative polyadenylation is a new facet of TDP-43 pathology.\nTDP-43 dysregulation of polyadenylation site selection is a defining feature of RNA misprocessing in ALS/FTD and related disorders\nAuthors: Arnold, F.

R.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576709\nNuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are observed in many neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto- temporal dementia (FTD). Although TDP-43 dysregulation of splicing has emerged as a key event in these diseases, TDP-43 can also regulate polyadenylation; yet, this has not been adequately studied. Here, we applied the dynamic analysis of polyadenylation from RNA-seq (DaPars) tool to ALS/FTD transcriptome datasets, and report extensive alternative polyadenylation (APA) upon TDP-43 alteration in ALS/FTD cell models and postmortem ALS/FTD neuronal nuclei. Importantly, many identified APA genes highlight pathways implicated in ALS/FTD pathogenesis. To determine the functional significance of APA elicited by TDP-43 nuclear depletion, we examined microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3). Nuclear loss of TDP-43 yielded increased expression of MARK3 transcripts with longer 3UTRs, resulting in greater transcript stability and elevated MARK3 protein levels, which promotes increased neuronal tau S262 phosphorylation. Our findings define changes in polyadenylation site selection as a previously unrecognized feature of TDP-43-driven disease pathology in ALS/FTD and highlight a potentially novel mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and tau regulation.\nDecoding Cortical Circuits: Synaptic Signatures and Disease Vulnerabilities of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neuron Types\nAuthors: Marcassa, G.; Dascenco, D.; Lorente-Echeverria, B.; Vanderlinden, J.; Leysen, E.; Baltussen, L.; Howden, A. J. M.; de Wit, J.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576602\nCortical layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons are embedded in distinct information processing pathways. Despite their significance for cognitive function, it remains poorly understood how L5 neuron types are connected into circuits and how this might be perturbed in disease. Utilizing an optimized proximity biotinylation workflow, we characterize the excitatory postsynaptic proteomes of L5 IT and PT neurons in intact somatosensory circuits. We find distinct molecular synaptic signatures of L5 IT and PT neurons defined by proteins regulating synaptic transmission and organization, suggesting that these contribute to function and input connectivity of L5 neuron types. The synaptic signature of L5 IT, but not of PT, neurons displays a marked enrichment of autism risk genes, aligning with previous studies highlighting the vulnerability of IT neurons and suggesting that the excitatory postsynaptic compartment of L5 IT neurons is notably susceptible in autism. Our analysis sheds light on the proteins that govern circuit integration and function of L5 neuron types and underlie their susceptibility in disease. Moreover, our approach is broadly applicable to other neuron types and circuits.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian behavior and physiology undergo dramatic changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their homeostatic needs, until weaning and puberty initiate nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviors develop and mature during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioral control have been identified1-6. These data reveal a remarkable diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioral or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including the perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and subsequent refinement of signaling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide novel insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviors and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The goal of this protocol is to enable better characterisation of multiphoton microscopy hardware across a large user base. The scope of this protocol is purposefully limited to focus on hardware, touching on software and data analysis routines only where relevant. The intended audiences are scientists using and building multiphoton microscopes in their laboratories. The goal is that any scientist, not only those with optical expertise, can test whether their multiphoton microscope is performing well and producing consistent data over the lifetime of their system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brains come in various sizes and shapes, yet how neuronal position constrains the type of circuits that they can form remains largely unknown. The spatial layout of anatomical structures with corresponding functions varies widely across species (J-4). Also, during evolution, anatomical structures have duplicated and then diverged to generate new circuits and functions (5, 6). Thus, it is critical to understand how the position of neurons constrains their integration into circuits and, ultimately, their function. To address this question, we studied EmlJ knockout mice in which subsets of neocortical neurons form a new structure below the neocortex termed heterotopia (Ht). We examined how this new location affects the molecular identity, topography, input-output circuit connectivity, electrophysiology, and functional properties of these neurons. Our results reveal a striking conservation of the cellular features and circuit properties of Ht neurons, despite their abnormal location and misorientation. Supporting this observation, these neurons were able to functionally substitute for overlying neocortical neurons in a behaviorally relevant task when the latter were optogenetically silenced. Hence, specific neuronal identities and associated function can be reproduced in altered anatomical settings, revealing a remarkable level of self-organization and adaptability of neocortical circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Different types of early-life adversity have been associated with childrens brain structure and function. However, understanding the disparate influence of distinct adversity exposures on the developing brain remains a major challenge. This study investigates the neural correlates of 10 robust dimensions of early-life adversity identified through exploratory factor analysis in a large community sample of youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Brain age models were trained, validated, and tested separately on T1- weighted (T1; N = 9524), diffusion tensor (DTI; N = 8834), and resting-state functional (rs- fMRI; N = 8233) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from two time points (mean age = 10.7 years, SD = 1.2, range = 8.9-13.8 years). Bayesian multilevel modelling supported distinct associations between different types of early-life adversity exposures and younger- and older-looking brains. Dimensions generally related to emotional neglect, such as lack of primary and secondary caregiver support, and lack of caregiver supervision, were associated with lower brain age gaps (BAGs), i.e., younger-looking brains. In contrast, dimensions generally related to caregiver psychopathology, trauma exposure, family aggression, substance use and separation from biological parent, and socio-economic disadvantage and neighbourhood safety were associated with higher BAGs, i.e., older-looking brains. The findings suggest that dimensions of early-life adversity are differentially associated with distinct neurodevelopmental patterns, indicative of dimension-specific delayed and accelerated brain maturation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is the hallmark of ALS, occurring in over 97% of cases. A key consequence of TDP-43 nuclear loss is the de-repression of cryptic exons. Whilst TDP-43 regulated cryptic splicing is increasingly well catalogued, cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, which define the 3 end of last exons, have been largely overlooked, especially when not associated with novel upstream splice junctions. We developed a novel bioinformatic approach to reliably identify distinct APA event types: alternative last exons (ALE), 3UTR extensions (3Ext) and intronic polyadenylation (IPA) events. We identified novel neuronal cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss of function by systematically applying our pipeline to a compendium of publicly available and in house datasets. We find that TDP-43 binding sites and target motifs are enriched at these cryptic events and that TDP-43 can have both repressive and enhancing action on APA. Importantly, all categories of cryptic APA can also be identified in ALS and FTD post mortem brain regions with TDP-43 proteinopathy underlining their potential disease relevance. RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses indicate that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript and translation. Intriguingly, cryptic 3Exts occur in multiple transcription factors, such as ELK1, SIX3, and TLX1, and lead to an increase in wild-type protein levels and function. Finally, we show that an increase in RNA stability leading to a higher cytoplasmic localisation underlies these observations. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces a novel category of cryptic RNA processing events and we expand the palette of TDP-43 loss consequences by showing this can also lead to an increase in normal protein translation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motor adaptation in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops has been studied mainly in animals using invasive electrophysiology. Here, we leverage functional neuroimaging in humans to study motor circuit plasticity in the human subcortex. We employed an experimental paradigm that combined two weeks of upper-extremity immobilization with daily resting-state and motor task fMRI before, during, and after the casting period. We previously showed that limb disuse leads to decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the contralateral somatomotor cortex (SM1) with the ipsilateral somatomotor cortex, increased FC with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) as well as the emergence of high amplitude, fMRI signal pulses localized in the contralateral SM1, supplementary motor area and the cerebellum. From our prior observations, it remains unclear whether the disuse plasticity affects the thalamus and striatum. We extended our analysis to include these subcortical regions and found that both exhibit strengthened cortical FC and spontaneous fMRI signal pulses induced by limb disuse. The dorsal posterior putamen and the central thalamus, mainly CM, VLP and VIM nuclei, showed disuse pulses and FC changes that lined up with fmri task activations from the Human connectome project motor system localizer, acquired before casting for each participant. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops in human motor plasticity and a potential link with the physiology of sleep regulation. Additionally, similarities with FC observation from Parkinson Disease (PD) questions a pathophysiological link with limb disuse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) are neuromodulators that are crucial for learning and decision-making. In the cortex, NE and ACh are released at specific sites along neuromodulatory axons, which would constrain their spatiotemporal dynamics at the subcellular scale. However, how the fluctuating patterns of NE and ACh signaling may be linked to behavioral events is unknown. Here, leveraging genetically encoded NE and ACh indicators, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the superficial layer of the mouse medial frontal cortex during decision-making. Head-fixed mice engage in a competitive game called matching pennies against a computer opponent. We show that both NE and ACh transients carry information about decision-related variables including choice, outcome, and reinforcer. However, the two neuromodulators differ in their spatiotemporal pattern of task-related activation. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, using optogenetics we found that evoked elevation of NE, but not ACh, in the medial frontal cortex increases the propensity of the animals to switch and explore alternate options. Taken together, the results reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns of rapid ACh and NE transients at the subcellular scale during decision-making in mice, which may endow these neuromodulators with different ways to impact neural plasticity to mediate learning and adaptive behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is depleted from the nucleus. TDP-43 loss leads to cryptic exon inclusion but a role in other RNA processing events remains unresolved. Here, we show that loss of TDP-43 causes widespread changes in alternative polyadenylation, impacting expression of disease-relevant genes (e.g., ELP1, NEFL, and TMEM106B) and providing evidence that alternative polyadenylation is a new facet of TDP-43 pathology.</p>

Although TDP-43 dysregulation of splicing has emerged as a key event in these diseases, TDP-43 can also regulate polyadenylation; yet, this has not been adequately studied. Here, we applied the dynamic analysis of polyadenylation from RNA-seq (DaPars) tool to ALS/FTD transcriptome datasets, and report extensive alternative polyadenylation (APA) upon TDP-43 alteration in ALS/FTD cell models and postmortem ALS/FTD neuronal nuclei. Importantly, many identified APA genes highlight pathways implicated in ALS/FTD pathogenesis. To determine the functional significance of APA elicited by TDP-43 nuclear depletion, we examined microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3). Nuclear loss of TDP-43 yielded increased expression of MARK3 transcripts with longer 3UTRs, resulting in greater transcript stability and elevated MARK3 protein levels, which promotes increased neuronal tau S262 phosphorylation. Our findings define changes in polyadenylation site selection as a previously unrecognized feature of TDP-43-driven disease pathology in ALS/FTD and highlight a potentially novel mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and tau regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cortical layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons are embedded in distinct information processing pathways. Despite their significance for cognitive function, it remains poorly understood how L5 neuron types are connected into circuits and how this might be perturbed in disease. Utilizing an optimized proximity biotinylation workflow, we characterize the excitatory postsynaptic proteomes of L5 IT and PT neurons in intact somatosensory circuits. We find distinct molecular synaptic signatures of L5 IT and PT neurons defined by proteins regulating synaptic transmission and organization, suggesting that these contribute to function and input connectivity of L5 neuron types. The synaptic signature of L5 IT, but not of PT, neurons displays a marked enrichment of autism risk genes, aligning with previous studies highlighting the vulnerability of IT neurons and suggesting that the excitatory postsynaptic compartment of L5 IT neurons is notably susceptible in autism. Our analysis sheds light on the proteins that govern circuit integration and function of L5 neuron types and underlie their susceptibility in disease. Moreover, our approach is broadly applicable to other neuron types and circuits.</p>
