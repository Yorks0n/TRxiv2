These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.\nEngineered 3D Immuno-Glial-Neurovascular Human Brain Model\nAuthors: Stanton, A.

By engineering a brain-mimicking 3D hydrogel and co-culturing all six major brain cell types derived from patient iPSCs, we have constructed, characterized, and utilized a multicellular integrated brain (miBrain) immuno-glial-neurovascular model with in vivo-like hallmarks. As proof of principle, here we utilized the miBrain to model Alzheimer's Disease pathologies associated with APOE4 genetic risk. APOE4 miBrains differentially exhibit amyloid aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and astrocytic GFAP. Unlike the co-emergent fate specification of glia and neurons in organoids, miBrains integrate independently differentiated cell types in a modular system with unique utility for elucidating cell-type specific contributions to pathogenesis. We here harness this feature to identify that risk factor APOE4 in astrocytes promotes tau pathogenesis and neuronal dysregulation through crosstalk with microglia.\nBRAND: A platform for closed-loop experiments with deep network models\nAuthors: Ali, Y.

D.; Miller, L. E.; Brandman, D. M.; Pandarinath, C.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552473\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g., Python and Julia) while maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing (e.g., C and C++). To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in BRAND with minimal implementation changes. In our tests, BRAND achieved \u003c600 microsecond latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 1-millisecond chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with less than 8 milliseconds of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. By providing a framework that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.\nDecoding reveals the neural representation of held and manipulated musical thoughts\nAuthors: Quiroga-Martinez, D. R.; Fernandez-Rubio, G.; Bonetti, L.; Achyutuni, K. G.; Tzovara, A.; Knight, R. T.; Vuust, P.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553456\nImagine a song you know by heart. With little effort you could sing it or play it vividly in your mind. However, we are only beginning to understand how the brain represents, holds, and manipulates these musical thoughts. Here, we decoded listened and imagined melodies from MEG brain data (N = 71) to show that auditory regions represent the sensory properties of individual sounds, whereas cognitive control (prefrontal cortex, basal nuclei, thalamus) and episodic memory areas (inferior and medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate, precuneus) hold and manipulate the melody as an abstract unit. Furthermore, the mental manipulation of a melody systematically changes its neural representation, reflecting the volitional control of auditory images. Our work sheds light on the nature and dynamics of auditory representations and paves the way for future work on neural decoding of auditory imagination.\nDaytime experiences shape neural activity and dream content in the sleeping brain\nAuthors: Kumral, D.; Palmieri, J.; Gais, S.; Schoenauer, M.\nScore: 62.9, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551087\nLearning-related brain activity patterns are replayed during sleep, and memories of recent experiences appear in our dreams. The connection between these phenomena, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether memory reinstatement during sleep contributes to dreaming. Participants listened to audiobooks before falling asleep. We could determine which audiobook they had studied based on dream reports collected during the night. Audiobook content was also reinstated at the neural level, in high-density EEG recordings. Brain activity during rapid eye movement sleep, particularly in the high-frequency beta range, carried information about the audiobook and simultaneously benefitted memory retention. Crucially, when the learning condition was manifest in neural activity, it also emerged in dreams. Reprocessing of daytime experiences during sleep thus shapes our brain activity, our dreams, and our memories.\nExpansion of a frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression\nAuthors: Lynch, C. J.; Elbau, I.; Ng, T.; Ayaz, A.; Zhu, S.; Manfredi, N.; Johnson, M.; Wolk, D.; Power, J. D.; Gordon, E. M.; Kay, K.; Aloysi, A.; Moia, S.; Gaudes, C. C.; Victoria, L. W.; Solomonov, N.; Goldwaser, E.; Zebley, B.; Grosenick, L.; Downar, J.; Vila-Rodriguez, F.; Daskalakis, Z. J.; Blumberger, D. M.; Williams, N.; Gunning, F.; Liston, C.\nScore: 26.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.551651\nHundreds of neuroimaging studies spanning two decades have revealed differences in brain structure and functional connectivity in depression, but with modest effect sizes, complicating efforts to derive mechanistic pathophysiologic insights or develop biomarkers.1 Furthermore, although depression is a fundamentally episodic condition, few neuroimaging studies have taken a longitudinal approach, which is critical for understanding cause and effect and delineating mechanisms that drive mood state transitions over time. The emerging field of precision functional mapping using densely-sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data has revealed unexpected, functionally meaningful individual differences in brain network topology in healthy individuals,2-5 but these approaches have never been applied to individuals with depression. Here, using precision functional mapping techniques and 11 datasets comprising n=187 repeatedly sampled individuals and \u003e21,000 minutes of fMRI data, we show that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded two-fold in most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in multiple samples, including large-scale, group-average data (N=1,231 subjects), and caused primarily by network border shifts affecting specific functional systems, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was unexpectedly stable over time, unaffected by changes in mood state, and detectable in children before the subsequent onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in specific frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptom domains and predicted future anhedonia symptoms before they emerged. Together, these findings identify a stable trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.\nSituating the parietal memory network in the context of multiple parallel distributed networks using high-resolution functional connectivity\nAuthors: Kwon, Y. H.; Salvo, J. J.; Anderson, N.; Holubecki, A. M.; Lakshman, M.; Yoo, K.; Kay, K.; Gratton, C.; Braga, R. M.\nScore: 25.6, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553585\nA principle of brain organization is that networks serving higher cognitive functions are widely distributed across the brain. One exception has been the parietal memory network (PMN), which plays a role in recognition memory but is often defined as being restricted to posteromedial association cortex. We hypothesized that high-resolution estimates of the PMN would reveal small regions that had been missed by prior approaches. High-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from extensively sampled participants was used to define the PMN within individuals. The PMN consistently extended beyond the core posteromedial set to include regions in the inferior parietal lobule; rostral, dorsal, medial, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex; the anterior insula; and ramus marginalis of the cingulate sulcus. The results suggest that, when fine-scale anatomy is considered, the PMN matches the expected distributed architecture of other association networks, reinforcing that parallel distributed networks are an organizing principle of association cortex.\nLearning produces a hippocampal cognitive map in the form of an orthogonalized state machine\nAuthors: Sun, W.; Winnubst, J.; Natrajan, M.; Lai, C.; Kajikawa, K.; Michaelos, M.; Gattoni, R.; Fitzgerald, J. E.; Spruston, N.\nScore: 107.9, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551900\nCognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.\nA developmental increase of inhibition promotes the emergence of hippocampal ripples\nAuthors: Pochinok, I.; Stöber, T. M.; Triesch, J.; Chini, M.; Hanganu-Opatz, I. L.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552951\nSharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are a hippocampal network phenomenon critical for memory consolidation and planning. SPW-Rs have been extensively studied in the adult brain, yet their developmental trajectory is poorly understood. While SPWs have been recorded in rodents shortly after birth, the time point and mechanisms of ripple emergence are still unclear. Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12 days-old mice to address this knowledge gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation of ChR2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day (P) 10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons. Finally, we show that early SPW-Rs elicit a more robust prefrontal cortex response then SPWs lacking ripples. Thus, development of inhibition promotes ripples emergence.\nSpectral consistency in sound sequence affects perceptual accuracy in discriminating subdivided rhythmic patterns\nAuthors: Nitta, J.; Kondoh, S.; Okanoya, K.; Tachibana, R. O.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.15.540754\nMusical compositions are distinguished by their unique rhythmic patterns, determined by subtle differences in how regular beats are subdivided. Precise perception of these subdivisions is essential for discerning nuances in rhythmic patterns. While musical rhythm typically comprises sound elements with a variety of timbres or spectral cues, the impact of such spectral variations on the perception of rhythmic patterns remains unclear. Here, we show that consistency in spectral cues affects perceptual accuracy in discriminating subdivided rhythmic patterns. We conducted online experiments using rhythmic sound sequences consisting of band-passed noise bursts to measure discrimination accuracy. Participants were asked to discriminate between a swing-like rhythm sequence, characterized by a 2:1 interval ratio, and its more or less exaggerated version. This task was also performed under two additional rhythm conditions: inversed-swing rhythm (1:2 ratio) and regular subdivision (1:1 ratio). The center frequency of the band noises was either held constant or alternated between two values. Our results revealed a significant decrease in discrimination accuracy when the center frequency was alternated, irrespective of the rhythm ratio condition. This suggests that rhythm perception is not only shaped by temporal structure but also affected by spectral properties.\n",

        <p class="abstract">When animals move through space, neurons in their entorhinal cortex activate periodically at multiple locations to form a map of the spatial environment. These grid cells may also map non-physical, conceptual spaces to support various other complex behaviors. Here, using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients performing an emotional memory task, we find that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe activate in a grid-like pattern across a two-dimensional feature space characterized by emotional valence and arousal. These neurons were different from cells tuned solely to valence or arousal, were preferentially located in the entorhinal cortex, and exhibited theta-phase locking. Our observation of grid-like neuronal activity during emotional processing in humans supports the idea that the neural structure of cognitive maps generalizes beyond spatial navigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Patient-specific, human-based cellular models that integrate biomimetic BBB, immune, and myelinated neuron components are critically needed to enable translationally relevant and accelerated discovery of neurological disease mechanisms and interventions. By engineering a brain-mimicking 3D hydrogel and co-culturing all six major brain cell types derived from patient iPSCs, we have constructed, characterized, and utilized a multicellular integrated brain (miBrain) immuno-glial-neurovascular model with in vivo-like hallmarks. As proof of principle, here we utilized the miBrain to model Alzheimer&#39;s Disease pathologies associated with APOE4 genetic risk. APOE4 miBrains differentially exhibit amyloid aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and astrocytic GFAP. Unlike the co-emergent fate specification of glia and neurons in organoids, miBrains integrate independently differentiated cell types in a modular system with unique utility for elucidating cell-type specific contributions to pathogenesis. We here harness this feature to identify that risk factor APOE4 in astrocytes promotes tau pathogenesis and neuronal dysregulation through crosstalk with microglia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g., Python and Julia) while maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing (e.g., C and C&#43;&#43;). To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in BRAND with minimal implementation changes. In our tests, BRAND achieved &lt;600 microsecond latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 1-millisecond chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with less than 8 milliseconds of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. By providing a framework that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Imagine a song you know by heart. With little effort you could sing it or play it vividly in your mind. However, we are only beginning to understand how the brain represents, holds, and manipulates these musical thoughts. Here, we decoded listened and imagined melodies from MEG brain data (N = 71) to show that auditory regions represent the sensory properties of individual sounds, whereas cognitive control (prefrontal cortex, basal nuclei, thalamus) and episodic memory areas (inferior and medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate, precuneus) hold and manipulate the melody as an abstract unit. Furthermore, the mental manipulation of a melody systematically changes its neural representation, reflecting the volitional control of auditory images. Our work sheds light on the nature and dynamics of auditory representations and paves the way for future work on neural decoding of auditory imagination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning-related brain activity patterns are replayed during sleep, and memories of recent experiences appear in our dreams. The connection between these phenomena, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether memory reinstatement during sleep contributes to dreaming. Participants listened to audiobooks before falling asleep. We could determine which audiobook they had studied based on dream reports collected during the night. Audiobook content was also reinstated at the neural level, in high-density EEG recordings. Brain activity during rapid eye movement sleep, particularly in the high-frequency beta range, carried information about the audiobook and simultaneously benefitted memory retention. Crucially, when the learning condition was manifest in neural activity, it also emerged in dreams. Reprocessing of daytime experiences during sleep thus shapes our brain activity, our dreams, and our memories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hundreds of neuroimaging studies spanning two decades have revealed differences in brain structure and functional connectivity in depression, but with modest effect sizes, complicating efforts to derive mechanistic pathophysiologic insights or develop biomarkers.1 Furthermore, although depression is a fundamentally episodic condition, few neuroimaging studies have taken a longitudinal approach, which is critical for understanding cause and effect and delineating mechanisms that drive mood state transitions over time. The emerging field of precision functional mapping using densely-sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data has revealed unexpected, functionally meaningful individual differences in brain network topology in healthy individuals,2-5 but these approaches have never been applied to individuals with depression. Here, using precision functional mapping techniques and 11 datasets comprising n=187 repeatedly sampled individuals and &gt;21,000 minutes of fMRI data, we show that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded two-fold in most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in multiple samples, including large-scale, group-average data (N=1,231 subjects), and caused primarily by network border shifts affecting specific functional systems, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was unexpectedly stable over time, unaffected by changes in mood state, and detectable in children before the subsequent onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in specific frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptom domains and predicted future anhedonia symptoms before they emerged. Together, these findings identify a stable trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A principle of brain organization is that networks serving higher cognitive functions are widely distributed across the brain. One exception has been the parietal memory network (PMN), which plays a role in recognition memory but is often defined as being restricted to posteromedial association cortex. We hypothesized that high-resolution estimates of the PMN would reveal small regions that had been missed by prior approaches. High-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from extensively sampled participants was used to define the PMN within individuals. The PMN consistently extended beyond the core posteromedial set to include regions in the inferior parietal lobule; rostral, dorsal, medial, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex; the anterior insula; and ramus marginalis of the cingulate sulcus. The results suggest that, when fine-scale anatomy is considered, the PMN matches the expected distributed architecture of other association networks, reinforcing that parallel distributed networks are an organizing principle of association cortex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning, and behavior. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are a hippocampal network phenomenon critical for memory consolidation and planning. SPW-Rs have been extensively studied in the adult brain, yet their developmental trajectory is poorly understood. While SPWs have been recorded in rodents shortly after birth, the time point and mechanisms of ripple emergence are still unclear. Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12 days-old mice to address this knowledge gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation of ChR2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day (P) 10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons. Finally, we show that early SPW-Rs elicit a more robust prefrontal cortex response then SPWs lacking ripples. Thus, development of inhibition promotes ripples emergence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Musical compositions are distinguished by their unique rhythmic patterns, determined by subtle differences in how regular beats are subdivided. Precise perception of these subdivisions is essential for discerning nuances in rhythmic patterns. While musical rhythm typically comprises sound elements with a variety of timbres or spectral cues, the impact of such spectral variations on the perception of rhythmic patterns remains unclear. Here, we show that consistency in spectral cues affects perceptual accuracy in discriminating subdivided rhythmic patterns. We conducted online experiments using rhythmic sound sequences consisting of band-passed noise bursts to measure discrimination accuracy. Participants were asked to discriminate between a swing-like rhythm sequence, characterized by a 2:1 interval ratio, and its more or less exaggerated version. This task was also performed under two additional rhythm conditions: inversed-swing rhythm (1:2 ratio) and regular subdivision (1:1 ratio). The center frequency of the band noises was either held constant or alternated between two values. Our results revealed a significant decrease in discrimination accuracy when the center frequency was alternated, irrespective of the rhythm ratio condition. This suggests that rhythm perception is not only shaped by temporal structure but also affected by spectral properties.</p>
