Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded \u003e3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.\nDistributed representations of innate behaviors in the hypothalamus do not predict specialized functional centers\nAuthors: Stagkourakis, S.; Spigolon, G.; Marks, M.; Feyder, M.; Kim, J.; Perona, P.; Pachitariu, M.; Anderson, D. J.\nScore: 41.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568163\nSurvival behaviors are orchestrated by hardwired circuits located in deep subcortical brain regions, most prominently the hypothalamus. Artificial activation of spatially localized, genetically defined hypothalamic cell populations is known to trigger distinct behaviors, suggesting a nucleus-centered organization of behavioral control. However, no study has investigated the hypothalamic representation of innate behaviors using unbiased, large-scale single neuron recordings. Here, using custom silicon probes, we performed recordings across the rostro-caudal extent of the medial hypothalamus in freely moving animals engaged in a diverse array of social and predator defense (\"fear\") behaviors. Nucleus-averaged activity revealed spatially distributed generic \"ignition signals\" that occurred at the onset of each behavior, and did not identify sparse, nucleus-specific behavioral representations. Single-unit analysis revealed that social and fear behavior classes are encoded by activity in distinct sets of spatially distributed neuronal ensembles spanning the entire hypothalamic rostro-caudal axis. Individual ensemble membership, however, was drawn from neurons in 3-4 adjacent nuclei. Mixed selectivity was identified as the most prevalent mode of behavior representation by individual hypothalamic neurons. Encoding models indicated that a significant fraction of the variance in single neuron activity is explained by behavior. This work reveals that innate behaviors are encoded in the hypothalamus by activity in spatially distributed neural ensembles that each span multiple neighboring nuclei, complementing the prevailing view of hypothalamic behavioral control by single nucleus-restricted cell types derived from perturbational studies.\nWhole-brain modelling of low-dimensional manifold modes reveals organising principle of brain dynamics\nAuthors: Sanz Perl, Y.; Geli, S.; Perez-Ordoyo, E.; Zonca, L.; Idesis, S.; Vohryzek, J.; Jirsa, V. K.; Kringelbach, M. L.; Tagliazucchi, E.; Deco, G.\nScore: 34.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567824\nThe revolutionary discovery of resting state networks radically shifted the focus from the role of local regions in cognitive tasks to the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in global networks. Yet, there is a growing realisation that these resting state networks could be a bit like the shadow tracings in Platos famous cave, perhaps mere epiphenomena of an underlying hidden space from where these shadows emanate. Here we used deep variational auto-encoders to extract manifolds of low dimensionality from whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, we constructed the first dynamical model of the low dimensional manifold modes, i.e., networks of nodes using non-linear oscillators coupled with the effective functional connectivity, taking into account the level of non-equilibrium dynamics quantified by the non-reversibility of the signals. Irrespective of parcellation size, we found an optimal number of roughly ten manifold modes to best describe the whole-brain activity. Importantly, compared to traditional whole-brain modelling using all the nodes in a parcellation, we obtained better results for resting and task activity by modelling the dynamics of the coupled manifold modes. These findings show the key causal role of manifolds as a fundamental organising principle of brain function at the whole-brain scale, providing evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of the brain.\nStereotyped goal-directed activity patterns in the insular cortex\nAuthors: Talpir, I.; Livneh, Y.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566809\nThe insular cortex is involved in diverse processes including bodily homeostasis, emotions, and cognition. Yet little is known about how it processes information at the level of neuronal populations, precluding an understanding of the computations it performs. We leveraged recent advances in machine learning to study insular cortex population activity patterns (i.e., neuronal manifold) in mice performing goal-directed behaviors. We find that the insular cortex activity manifold is remarkably consistent across different animals and under different motivational states. Activity dynamics within the neuronal manifold are highly stereotyped during rewarded trials, enabling robust prediction of trial outcomes across different mice, and across various natural and artificial motivational states. Comparing goal-directed behavior with self-paced free consumption, we find that the stereotyped activity patterns reflect goal-directed reward anticipation, and not licking, taste, or valence. These findings reveal a core computation in insular cortex that could explain its involvement in pathologies involving aberrant motivations. O_LIInsCtx activity manifold structure is stereotyped across different mice and motivations. C_LIO_LIInsCtx activity dynamics within the manifold are stereotyped across different mice and motivations. C_LIO_LIStereotyped activity dynamics reflect goal-directed reward anticipation. C_LIO_LIStereotyped activity dynamics do not reflect licking, taste, or valence. C_LI\nPropofol anesthesia destabilizes neural dynamics across cortex\nAuthors: Eisen, A. J.; Kozachkov, L.; Bastos, A. M.; Donoghue, J. A.; Mahnke, M. K.; Brincat, S. L.; Chandra, S.; Brown, E. N.; Fiete, I.; Miller, E. K.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568595\nEvery day, hundreds of thousands of people undergo general anesthesia. One hypothesis is that anesthesia disrupts dynamic stability, the ability of the brain to balance excitability with the need to be stable and thus controllable. We tested this hypothesis using a new method for quantifying population-level dynamic stability in complex systems, Delayed Linear Analysis for Stability Estimation (DeLASE). Propofol was used to transition animals between the awake state and anesthetized unconsciousness. DeLASE was applied to macaque cortex local field potentials (LFPs). We found that neural dynamics were more unstable in unconsciousness compared to the awake state. Cortical trajectories mirrored predictions from destabilized linear systems. We mimicked the effect of propofol in simulated neural networks by increasing inhibitory tone. Paradoxically, increased inhibition also destabilized the networks. Our results suggest that anesthesia disrupts dynamical stability that is required for consciousness.\nAn arginine-rich nuclear localization signal (ArgiNLS) strategy for streamlined image segmentation of single-cells\nAuthors: Szelenyi, E. R.; Navarrete, J. S.; Murry, A. D.; Zhang, Y.; Girven, K. S.; Kuo, L.; Cline, M. M.; Bernstein, M. X.; Burdyniuk, M.; Bowler, B.; Goodwin, N. L.; Juarez, B.; Zweifel, L.; Golden, S.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568319\nHigh-throughput volumetric fluorescent microscopy pipelines can spatially integrate whole-brain structure and function at the foundational level of single-cells. However, conventional fluorescent protein (FP) modifications used to discriminate single-cells possess limited efficacy or are detrimental to cellular health. Here, we introduce a synthetic and non-deleterious nuclear localization signal (NLS) tag strategy, called Arginine-rich NLS (ArgiNLS), that optimizes genetic labeling and downstream image segmentation of single-cells by restricting FP localization near-exclusively in the nucleus through a poly-arginine mechanism. A single N-terminal ArgiNLS tag provides modular nuclear restriction consistently across spectrally separate FP variants. ArgiNLS performance in vivo displays functional conservation across major cortical cell classes, and in response to both local and systemic brain wide AAV administration. Crucially, the high signal-to-noise ratio afforded by ArgiNLS enhances ML-automated segmentation of single-cells due to rapid classifier training and enrichment of labeled cell detection within 2D brain sections or 3D volumetric whole-brain image datasets, derived from both staining-amplified and native signal. This genetic strategy provides a simple and flexible basis for precise image segmentation of genetically labeled single-cells at scale and paired with behavioral procedures. Significance StatementQuantifying labeled cells in fluorescent microscopy is a fundamental aspect of a modern biology. Critically, the use of short nuclear localization sequences (NLS) is a key genetic modification for discriminating single-cells labeled with fluorescent proteins (FPs). However, mainstay NLS approaches typically localize proteins to the nucleus with limited efficacy, while alternative non-NLS tag strategies can enhance efficacy at the cost of cellular health. Thus, quantitative cell counting using FP labels remains suboptimal or not compatible with health and behavior. Here, we present a novel genetic tagging strategy - named ArgiNLS - that flexibly and safely achieves FP nuclear restriction across the brain to facilitate machine learning-based segmentation of single-cells at scale, delivering a timely update to the behavioral neuroscientists toolkit.\nOptical constraints on two-photon voltage imaging\nAuthors: Davis, H. C.; Brooks, F. P.; Wong-Campos, J. D.; Cohen, A. E.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567441\nGenetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are a valuable tool for studying neural circuits in vivo, but the relative merits of one-photon (1P) vs. two-photon (2P) voltage imaging are not well characterized. Here we compare the photophysical and imaging properties of commonly used GEVIs under 1P and 2P excitation. 2P excitation requires [~]104-fold more illumination power per cell to produce comparable photon count rates to 1P excitation, driving a stringent tradeoff between shot noise and tissue photodamage.\nGenetic labeling of embryonically-born dentate granule neurons in young mice using the PenkCre mouse line\nAuthors: Mortessagne, P.; Cartier, E.; Balia, M.; Fevre, M.; Corailler, F.; Herry, C.; Abrous, N.; Battefeld, A.; Pacary, E.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567945\nThe dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a mosaic of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) accumulated throughout life. While many studies focused on the morpho-functional properties of adult-born DGNs, much less is known about DGNs generated during development, and in particular those born during embryogenesis. One of the main reasons for this gap is the lack of methods available to specifically label and manipulate embryonically-born DGNs. Here, we have assessed the relevance of the PenkCre mouse line as a genetic model to target this embryonically-born population. In young animals, PenkCre expression allows to tag neurons in the DG with positional, morphological and electrophysiological properties characteristic of DGNs born during the embryonic period. In addition, PenkCre+ cells in the DG are distributed in both blades along the entire septo-temporal axis. This model thus offers new possibilities to explore the functions of this underexplored population of embryonically-born DGNs.\nExpansion of the neocortex and protection from neurodegeneration by in vivo transient reprogramming\nAuthors: Shen, Y.-R.; Zaballa, S.; Bech, X.; Sancho-Balsells, A.; Diaz-Cifuentes, C.; Seyit-Bremer, G.; Ballasch, I.; Alcazar, N.; Alberch, J.; Abad, M.; Serrano, M.; Klein, R.; Giralt, A.; del Toro, D.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568858\nYamanaka factors (YFs) can reverse some aging features in mammalian tissues, but their effects on the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we induced YFs in the mouse brain in a controlled spatio-temporal manner in two different scenarios: brain development, and adult stages in the context of neurodegeneration. Embryonic induction of YFs perturbed cell identity of both progenitors and neurons, but transient and low-level expression is tolerated by these cells during development. Under these conditions, YFs induction led to expanded neurogenesis, increased number of upper cortical neurons, and enhanced motor and social behavior of adult mice. Additionally, controlled YF induction is tolerated by principal neurons in the adult dorsal hippocampus and prevented the development of several hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, including cognitive decline and altered molecular signatures, in the 5xFAD mouse model. Overall, these results highlight the powerful impact of YFs on neurogenesis and their potential use in brain disorders.\nSex differences in intrinsic functional cortical organization reflect differences in network topology rather than cortical morphometry\nAuthors: Serio, B.; Hettwer, M. D.; Wiersch, L.; Bignardi, G.; Sacher, J.; Weis, S.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Valk, S. L.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568437\nBrain size robustly differs between sexes. However, the consequences of this anatomical dimorphism on sex differences in intrinsic brain function remain unclear. We investigated the extent to which sex differences in intrinsic cortical functional organization may be explained by differences in cortical morphometry, namely brain size, microstructure, and the geodesic distances of connectivity profiles. For this, we computed a low dimensional representation of functional cortical organization, the sensory-association axis, and identified widespread sex differences. Contrary to our expectations, observed sex differences in functional organization were not fundamentally associated with differences in brain size, microstructural organization, or geodesic distances, despite these morphometric properties being per se associated with functional organization and differing between sexes. Instead, functional sex differences in the sensory-association axis were associated with differences in functional connectivity profiles and network topology. Collectively, our findings suggest that sex differences in functional cortical organization extend beyond sex differences in cortical morphometry.

        <p class="abstract">Functional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded &gt;3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Survival behaviors are orchestrated by hardwired circuits located in deep subcortical brain regions, most prominently the hypothalamus. Artificial activation of spatially localized, genetically defined hypothalamic cell populations is known to trigger distinct behaviors, suggesting a nucleus-centered organization of behavioral control. However, no study has investigated the hypothalamic representation of innate behaviors using unbiased, large-scale single neuron recordings. Here, using custom silicon probes, we performed recordings across the rostro-caudal extent of the medial hypothalamus in freely moving animals engaged in a diverse array of social and predator defense (&#34;fear&#34;) behaviors. Nucleus-averaged activity revealed spatially distributed generic &#34;ignition signals&#34; that occurred at the onset of each behavior, and did not identify sparse, nucleus-specific behavioral representations. Single-unit analysis revealed that social and fear behavior classes are encoded by activity in distinct sets of spatially distributed neuronal ensembles spanning the entire hypothalamic rostro-caudal axis. Individual ensemble membership, however, was drawn from neurons in 3-4 adjacent nuclei. Mixed selectivity was identified as the most prevalent mode of behavior representation by individual hypothalamic neurons. Encoding models indicated that a significant fraction of the variance in single neuron activity is explained by behavior. This work reveals that innate behaviors are encoded in the hypothalamus by activity in spatially distributed neural ensembles that each span multiple neighboring nuclei, complementing the prevailing view of hypothalamic behavioral control by single nucleus-restricted cell types derived from perturbational studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The revolutionary discovery of resting state networks radically shifted the focus from the role of local regions in cognitive tasks to the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in global networks. Yet, there is a growing realisation that these resting state networks could be a bit like the shadow tracings in Platos famous cave, perhaps mere epiphenomena of an underlying hidden space from where these shadows emanate. Here we used deep variational auto-encoders to extract manifolds of low dimensionality from whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, we constructed the first dynamical model of the low dimensional manifold modes, i.e., networks of nodes using non-linear oscillators coupled with the effective functional connectivity, taking into account the level of non-equilibrium dynamics quantified by the non-reversibility of the signals. Irrespective of parcellation size, we found an optimal number of roughly ten manifold modes to best describe the whole-brain activity. Importantly, compared to traditional whole-brain modelling using all the nodes in a parcellation, we obtained better results for resting and task activity by modelling the dynamics of the coupled manifold modes. These findings show the key causal role of manifolds as a fundamental organising principle of brain function at the whole-brain scale, providing evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of the brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The insular cortex is involved in diverse processes including bodily homeostasis, emotions, and cognition. Yet little is known about how it processes information at the level of neuronal populations, precluding an understanding of the computations it performs. We leveraged recent advances in machine learning to study insular cortex population activity patterns (i.e., neuronal manifold) in mice performing goal-directed behaviors. We find that the insular cortex activity manifold is remarkably consistent across different animals and under different motivational states. Activity dynamics within the neuronal manifold are highly stereotyped during rewarded trials, enabling robust prediction of trial outcomes across different mice, and across various natural and artificial motivational states. Comparing goal-directed behavior with self-paced free consumption, we find that the stereotyped activity patterns reflect goal-directed reward anticipation, and not licking, taste, or valence. These findings reveal a core computation in insular cortex that could explain its involvement in pathologies involving aberrant motivations.

        <p class="abstract">Every day, hundreds of thousands of people undergo general anesthesia. One hypothesis is that anesthesia disrupts dynamic stability, the ability of the brain to balance excitability with the need to be stable and thus controllable. We tested this hypothesis using a new method for quantifying population-level dynamic stability in complex systems, Delayed Linear Analysis for Stability Estimation (DeLASE). Propofol was used to transition animals between the awake state and anesthetized unconsciousness. DeLASE was applied to macaque cortex local field potentials (LFPs). We found that neural dynamics were more unstable in unconsciousness compared to the awake state. Cortical trajectories mirrored predictions from destabilized linear systems. We mimicked the effect of propofol in simulated neural networks by increasing inhibitory tone. Paradoxically, increased inhibition also destabilized the networks. Our results suggest that anesthesia disrupts dynamical stability that is required for consciousness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High-throughput volumetric fluorescent microscopy pipelines can spatially integrate whole-brain structure and function at the foundational level of single-cells. However, conventional fluorescent protein (FP) modifications used to discriminate single-cells possess limited efficacy or are detrimental to cellular health. Here, we introduce a synthetic and non-deleterious nuclear localization signal (NLS) tag strategy, called  Arginine-rich NLS (ArgiNLS), that optimizes genetic labeling and downstream image segmentation of single-cells by restricting FP localization near-exclusively in the nucleus through a poly-arginine mechanism. A single N-terminal ArgiNLS tag provides modular nuclear restriction consistently across spectrally separate FP variants. ArgiNLS performance in vivo displays functional conservation across major cortical cell classes, and in response to both local and systemic brain wide AAV administration. Crucially, the high signal-to-noise ratio afforded by ArgiNLS enhances ML-automated segmentation of single-cells due to rapid classifier training and enrichment of labeled cell detection within 2D brain sections or 3D volumetric whole-brain image datasets, derived from both staining-amplified and native signal. This genetic strategy provides a simple and flexible basis for precise image segmentation of genetically labeled single-cells at scale and paired with behavioral procedures.

Significance StatementQuantifying labeled cells in fluorescent microscopy is a fundamental aspect of a modern biology. Critically, the use of short nuclear localization sequences (NLS) is a key genetic modification for discriminating single-cells labeled with fluorescent proteins (FPs). However, mainstay NLS approaches typically localize proteins to the nucleus with limited efficacy, while alternative non-NLS tag strategies can enhance efficacy at the cost of cellular health. Thus, quantitative cell counting using FP labels remains suboptimal or not compatible with health and behavior. Here, we present a novel genetic tagging strategy - named ArgiNLS - that flexibly and safely achieves FP nuclear restriction across the brain to facilitate machine learning-based segmentation of single-cells at scale, delivering a timely update to the behavioral neuroscientists toolkit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are a valuable tool for studying neural circuits in vivo, but the relative merits of one-photon (1P) vs. two-photon (2P) voltage imaging are not well characterized. Here we compare the photophysical and imaging properties of commonly used GEVIs under 1P and 2P excitation. 2P excitation requires [~]104-fold more illumination power per cell to produce comparable photon count rates to 1P excitation, driving a stringent tradeoff between shot noise and tissue photodamage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a mosaic of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) accumulated throughout life. While many studies focused on the morpho-functional properties of adult-born DGNs, much less is known about DGNs generated during development, and in particular those born during embryogenesis. One of the main reasons for this gap is the lack of methods available to specifically label and manipulate embryonically-born DGNs. Here, we have assessed the relevance of the PenkCre mouse line as a genetic model to target this embryonically-born population. In young animals, PenkCre expression allows to tag neurons in the DG with positional, morphological and electrophysiological properties characteristic of DGNs born during the embryonic period. In addition, PenkCre&#43; cells in the DG are distributed in both blades along the entire septo-temporal axis. This model thus offers new possibilities to explore the functions of this underexplored population of embryonically-born DGNs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Yamanaka factors (YFs) can reverse some aging features in mammalian tissues, but their effects on the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we induced YFs in the mouse brain in a controlled spatio-temporal manner in two different scenarios: brain development, and adult stages in the context of neurodegeneration. Embryonic induction of YFs perturbed cell identity of both progenitors and neurons, but transient and low-level expression is tolerated by these cells during development. Under these conditions, YFs induction led to expanded neurogenesis, increased number of upper cortical neurons, and enhanced motor and social behavior of adult mice. Additionally, controlled YF induction is tolerated by principal neurons in the adult dorsal hippocampus and prevented the development of several hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, including cognitive decline and altered molecular signatures, in the 5xFAD mouse model. Overall, these results highlight the powerful impact of YFs on neurogenesis and their potential use in brain disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain size robustly differs between sexes. However, the consequences of this anatomical dimorphism on sex differences in intrinsic brain function remain unclear. We investigated the extent to which sex differences in intrinsic cortical functional organization may be explained by differences in cortical morphometry, namely brain size, microstructure, and the geodesic distances of connectivity profiles. For this, we computed a low dimensional representation of functional cortical organization, the sensory-association axis, and identified widespread sex differences. Contrary to our expectations, observed sex differences in functional organization were not fundamentally associated with differences in brain size, microstructural organization, or geodesic distances, despite these morphometric properties being per se associated with functional organization and differing between sexes. Instead, functional sex differences in the sensory-association axis were associated with differences in functional connectivity profiles and network topology. Collectively, our findings suggest that sex differences in functional cortical organization extend beyond sex differences in cortical morphometry.
