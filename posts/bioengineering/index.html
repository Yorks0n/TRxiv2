Vaccines are pathogen specific, and new vaccines are needed for mutants and emerging pathogens. Here, we report a \"drug free\" prophylactic platform - a \"Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray\" (PCANS) that acts via a multi-pronged approach to prevent a broad spectrum of respiratory infections. PCANS forms a protective coating in the nasal cavity that enhances the capture of large respiratory droplets. The coating acts as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, and rapidly neutralizes them, reducing the pathogen load by \u003e99.99%. In mice, PCANS showed nasal retention for at least 8 h and was safe for daily administration. A single prophylactic dose of PCANS protected mice against supra-lethal dosages of a mouse-adapted H1N1 Influenza virus (PR8), reduced lung viral titer by \u003e99.99%, improved survival, and suppressed pathological manifestations. Together, our data suggest PCANS as a promising daily-use prophylactic approach against current and emerging respiratory infections.\nBioengineered human colon organoids with in vivo-like complexity and function\nAuthors: Mitrofanova, O.; Broguiere, N.; Nikolaev, M.; Lutolf, M. P.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560991\nOrganoids and microphysiological systems, such as organs-on-a-chip, have emerged as powerful tools for modeling human gut physiology and disease in vitro. However, although physiologically relevant, these systems often lack the environmental milieu, spatial organization, cell-type diversity, and maturity necessary for mimicking adult human intestinal mucosa. To instead generate models closely resembling the in vivo cell-type composition and spatial compartmentalization, we herein integrated organoid and organ-on-a-chip technology to develop a primary human stem-cell-derived organoid model, called mini-colons. The luminal access and flow in human mini-colons removes shed cells to greatly enhance tissue longevity and differentiation over physically inaccessible human intestinal organoids that accumulate trapped cellular debris and waste. By establishing a gradient of growth factors, we replicated and sustained in vivo-like cell fate patterning and concurrent differentiation to secretory cell types and colonocytes. These long-lived human mini-colons contain abundant mucus-producing Goblet cells that lubricate the colonic epithelial lining. The stem and proliferative progenitor cells are also realistically confined to the crypts, facilitating stable homeostatic tissue turnover and preserving tissue integrity for several weeks. Also signifying mini-colon in vivo-like maturation, single-cell RNA sequencing showed emerging mature colonocytes and absorptive BEST4+ colonocytes. This methodology could be expanded to generate microtissues derived from the small intestine and incorporate additional microenvironmental components, thus emulating the intricate complexity of the native gut in an in vitro setting. Our bioengineered human organoids provide a highly accurate, long-lived, functional platform to systematically study human gut physiology and pathology, and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.\nTrehalose-based coacervates for local bioactive protein delivery to the central nervous system\nAuthors: Hassan, L. F.; Sen, R.; O'Shea, T. M.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561124\nTherapeutic outcomes of local biomolecule delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) using bulk biomaterials are limited by inadequate drug loading, neuropil disruption, and severe foreign body responses. Effective CNS delivery requires ad-dressing these issues and developing well-tolerated, highly-loaded carriers that are dis-persible within local neural parenchyma. Here, we synthesized biodegradable trehalose-based polyelectrolyte oligomers using facile A2:B3:AR thiol-ene Michael addition reac-tions that form complex coacervates upon mixing of oppositely charged oligomers. Co-acervates permit high concentration loading and controlled release of bioactive growth factors, enzymes, and antibodies, with modular formulation parameters that confer tuna-ble release kinetics. Coacervates are cytocompatible and readily bind to cultured neural cells in vitro but remain extracellularly. Coacervates serve as effective vehicles for pre-cisely delivering biomolecules, including bioactive neurotrophins, to the mouse striatum following intraparenchymal injection. These results support the use of trehalose-based coacervates as part of therapeutic protein delivery strategies for CNS disorders.\nOptimizing Cryo-EM Structural Analysis of Gi-coupling Receptors via Engineered Gt and Nb35 Application\nAuthors: Oshima, H. S.; Sano, F. K.; Akasaka, H.; Iwama, A.; Shihoya, W.; Nureki, O.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561347\nCryo-EM single particle analysis has recently facilitated the high-resolution structural determination of numerous GPCR-G complexes. Diverse methodologies have been devised with this trend, and in the case of GPCR-Gi complexes, scFv16, an antibody that recognizes the intricate interface of the complex, has been mainly implemented to stabilize the complex. However, owing to their flexibility and heterogeneity, structural determinations of GPCR-Gi complexes remain both challenging and resource-intensive. By employing eGt, which exhibits binding affinity to modified nanobody Nb35, the cryo-EM structure of Rhodopsin-eGt complex was previously reported. Using this modified G protein, we determined the structure of the ETB-eGt complex bound to the modified Nb35. The determined structure of ETB receptor was the same as the previously reported ETB-Gi complex, and the resulting dataset demonstrated significantly improved anisotropy. This modified G protein will be utilized for the structural determination of other GPCR-Gi complexes. HighlightsO_LIThe study introduces the engineered G protein subunit eGT, which enhances the resolution of GPCR-G protein structures by suppressing G protein conformational fluctuations and is particularly beneficial for Gi-coupled receptors. C_LIO_LIThe cryo-EM structure of the ETB receptor complexed with eGt-Nb35 reveals improved map quality, reduced anisotropy, and isotropic density distribution, increasing the accuracy of structural analysis. C_LIO_LIStructural comparison between ETB-Gi and ETB-eGt reveals similar receptor-G protein interactions, demonstrating the utility of eGt-Nb35 for studying GPCR-Gi complexes and the potential for broader applications within the Gi family.

R.; Ferronato, G.; Heinzelmann, I.; Grechi, N.; Devkota, S.; Fontes, P. K.; Coeti, R.; Oshiro, T. S. I.; Ferraz, M. d. A. M. M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561536\nUnderstanding the mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues is vital for regenerative medicine in tissue engineering. This study investigated the changes in Young's modulus (YM), storage modulus (E'), loss modulus (E\"), and porosity of native and decellularized bovine reproductive tissues during the estrous cycle. Testis tunica albuginea had significantly higher YM, E', and E\" than the inner testis, indicating greater stiffness and viscoelasticity. Endometrium showed no distinct differences in YM, E', or E' across the estrous cycle or between horns. Ovaries exhibited significant variations in YM, E', E\", and porosity, with higher YM and E' in the ipsilateral cortex and medulla during the luteal phase. Decellularized ovarian tissues displayed increased porosity. The oviduct displayed no significant differences in YM or E' in the isthmus, but the contralateral ampulla had reduced YM and E' in the luteal phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues, facilitating the development of biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.\nModeling dry eye with an air-liquid interface in corneal epithelium-on-a-chip\nAuthors: Abdalkader, R. K.; Chaleckis, R.; Fujita, T.; Kamei, K.-i.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561437\nDry eye syndrome (DES) is a complex ocular condition characterized by an unstable tear film and inadequate tear production, leading to tissue damage. Despite its common occurrence, there is currently no comprehensive in vitro model that accurately reproduce the cellular characteristics of DES. Here we modified a corneal epithelium-on-a-chip (CEpOC) model to recapitulate DES by subjecting HCE-T human corneal epithelial cells to an air-liquid (AL) interface stimulus. We then assessed the effects of AL stimulation both in the presence and absence of diclofenac (DCF). Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression changes in response to AL and AL_DCF, affecting pathways related to development, epithelial structure, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Both treatments upregulated PIEZO2, linked to corneal damage signaling, while downregulating OCLN, involved in cell-cell junctions. They increased the expression of inflammatory genes (e.g., IL6) and reduced mucin production genes (e.g., MUC16), reflecting dry eye characteristics. TGFB1, crucial for corneal wound healing, was slightly downregulated in AL_DCF, potentially affecting wound healing processes rather than reducing inflammation by DCF. Metabolomic analysis showed increased secretion of metabolites associated with cell damage and inflammation (e.g., methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid, lauroyl-carnitine) in response to AL and even more with AL_DCF, indicating a shift in cellular metabolism. This study showcases the utilization of AL stimulus within the CEpOC as a comprehensive approach to faithfully reproduce the cellular characteristics of DES.\nRemotely controlled drug release in deep brain regionsof non-human primates\nAuthors: Wilson, M. G.; Webb, T. D.; Odeen, H.; Kubanek, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561539\nMany areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound-remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy-may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects' visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.\nSite-specific arrangement and structure determination of minor groove binding molecules in self-assembled three-dimensional DNA crystals\nAuthors: Simmons, C. R.; Buchberger, A.; Henry, S. J. W.; Novacek, A.; Fahmi, N. E.; MacCulloch, T.; Stephanopoulos, N.; Yan, H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561756\nThe structural analysis of guest molecules in rationally designed and self-assembling DNA crystals has proven elusive since its conception. Oligonucleotide frameworks provide an especially attractive route towards studying DNA-binding molecules by using three-dimensional lattices with defined sequence and structure. In this work, we site-specifically position a suite of minor groove binding molecules, and solve their structures via x-ray crystallography, as a proof-of-principle towards scaffolding larger guest species. Two crystal motifs were used to precisely immobilize the molecules DAPI, Hoechst, and netropsin at defined positions in the lattice, allowing us to control occupancy within the crystal. We also solved the structure of a three-ring imidazole-pyrrole-pyrrole polyamide molecule, which sequence-specifically packs in an anti-parallel dimeric arrangement within the minor groove. Finally, we engineered a crystal designed to position both netropsin and the polyamide at two distinct locations within the same lattice. Our work elucidates the design principles for the spatial arrangement of functional guests within lattices and opens new potential opportunities for the use of DNA crystals to display and structurally characterize small molecules, peptides, and ultimately proteins of un-known structure.\nA supernumerary synthetic chromosome in Komagataella phaffii as a repository for extraneous genetic material\nAuthors: Abramczyk, D.; Sanchez-Olmos, M. d. C.; Ramirez Rojas, A. A.; Schindler, D.; Robertson, D.; McColm, S.; Marston, A.; Barlow, P.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561004\nBackgroundKomagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) is a methylotropic commercially important non-conventional species of yeast that grows in a fermentor to exceptionally high densities on simple media and secretes recombinant proteins efficiently. Genetic engineering strategies are being explored in this organism to facilitate cost-effective biomanufacturing. Small, stable artificial chromosomes in K. phaffii could offer unique advantages by accommodating multiple integrations of extraneous genes and their promoters without accumulating perturbations of native chromosomes or exhausting the availability of selection markers. ResultsHere, we describe a linear \"nano\"chromosome (of 15-25 kb) that, according to whole-genome sequencing, persists in K. phaffii over many generations with a copy number per cell of one, provided non-homologous end joining is compromised (by KU70-knockout). The nanochromosome includes a copy of the centromere from K. phaffii chromosome 3, a K. phaffii-derived autonomously replicating sequence on either side of the centromere, and a pair of K. phaffii-like telomeres. It contains, within its q arm, a landing zone in which genes of interest alternate with long (approx. 1-kb) non-coding DNA chosen to facilitate homologous recombination and serve as spacers. The landing zone can be extended along the nanochromosome, in an inch-worming mode of sequential gene integrations, accompanied by recycling of just two antibiotic-resistance markers. The nanochromosome was used to express PDI, a gene encoding protein disulfide isomerase. Co-expression with PDI allowed the production, from a genomically integrated gene, of secreted murine complement factor H, a plasma protein containing 40 disulfide bonds. As further proof-of-principle, we co-expressed, from a nanochromosome, both PDI and a gene for GFP-tagged human complement factor H under the control of PAOX1 and demonstrated that the secreted protein was active as a regulator of the complement system. ConclusionsWe have added K. phaffii to the list of organisms that can produce human proteins from genes carried on a stable, linear, artificial chromosome. We envisage using nanochromosomes as repositories for numerous extraneous genes, allowing intensive engineering of K. phaffii without compromising its genome or weakening the resulting strain.\nSpiral NeuroString: High-Density Soft Bioelectronic Fibers for Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation\nAuthors: Khatib, M.; Zhao, E.

A.; Dunn, J.; Bao, Z.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560482\nBioelectronic fibers hold promise for both research and clinical applications due to their compactness, ease of implantation, and ability to incorporate various functionalities such as sensing and stimulation. However, existing devices suffer from bulkiness, rigidity, limited functionality, and low density of active components. These limitations stem from the difficulty to incorporate many components on one-dimensional (1D) fiber devices due to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (e.g., photolithography) with curved, thin and long fiber structures. Herein, we introduce a fabrication approach, \"spiral transformation'', to convert two-dimensional (2D) films containing microfabricated devices into 1D soft fibers. This approach allows for the creation of high density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibers, termed Spiral NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control over the longitudinal, angular, and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. We show the utility of S-NeuroString for motility mapping, serotonin sensing, and tissue stimulation within the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal (GI) system, as well as for single-unit recordings in the brain. The described bioelectronic fibers hold great promises for next-generation multifunctional implantable electronics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Respiratory infections pose a global health crisis. Vaccines are pathogen specific, and new vaccines are needed for mutants and emerging pathogens. Here, we report a &#34;drug free&#34; prophylactic platform - a &#34;Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray&#34; (PCANS) that acts via a multi-pronged approach to prevent a broad spectrum of respiratory infections. PCANS forms a protective coating in the nasal cavity that enhances the capture of large respiratory droplets. The coating acts as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, and rapidly neutralizes them, reducing the pathogen load by &gt;99.99%. In mice, PCANS showed nasal retention for at least 8 h and was safe for daily administration. A single prophylactic dose of PCANS protected mice against supra-lethal dosages of a mouse-adapted H1N1 Influenza virus (PR8), reduced lung viral titer by &gt;99.99%, improved survival, and suppressed pathological manifestations. Together, our data suggest PCANS as a promising daily-use prophylactic approach against current and emerging respiratory infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids and microphysiological systems, such as organs-on-a-chip, have emerged as powerful tools for modeling human gut physiology and disease in vitro. However, although physiologically relevant, these systems often lack the environmental milieu, spatial organization, cell-type diversity, and maturity necessary for mimicking adult human intestinal mucosa. To instead generate models closely resembling the in vivo cell-type composition and spatial compartmentalization, we herein integrated organoid and organ-on-a-chip technology to develop a primary human stem-cell-derived organoid model, called  mini-colons. The luminal access and flow in human mini-colons removes shed cells to greatly enhance tissue longevity and differentiation over physically inaccessible human intestinal organoids that accumulate trapped cellular debris and waste. By establishing a gradient of growth factors, we replicated and sustained in vivo-like cell fate patterning and concurrent differentiation to secretory cell types and colonocytes. These long-lived human mini-colons contain abundant mucus-producing Goblet cells that lubricate the colonic epithelial lining. The stem and proliferative progenitor cells are also realistically confined to the crypts, facilitating stable homeostatic tissue turnover and preserving tissue integrity for several weeks. Also signifying mini-colon in vivo-like maturation, single-cell RNA sequencing showed emerging mature colonocytes and absorptive BEST4&#43; colonocytes. This methodology could be expanded to generate microtissues derived from the small intestine and incorporate additional microenvironmental components, thus emulating the intricate complexity of the native gut in an in vitro setting. Our bioengineered human organoids provide a highly accurate, long-lived, functional platform to systematically study human gut physiology and pathology, and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Therapeutic outcomes of local biomolecule delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) using bulk biomaterials are limited by inadequate drug loading, neuropil disruption, and severe foreign body responses. Effective CNS delivery requires ad-dressing these issues and developing well-tolerated, highly-loaded carriers that are dis-persible within local neural parenchyma. Here, we synthesized biodegradable trehalose-based polyelectrolyte oligomers using facile A2:B3:AR thiol-ene Michael addition reac-tions that form complex coacervates upon mixing of oppositely charged oligomers. Co-acervates permit high concentration loading and controlled release of bioactive growth factors, enzymes, and antibodies, with modular formulation parameters that confer tuna-ble release kinetics. Coacervates are cytocompatible and readily bind to cultured neural cells in vitro but remain extracellularly. Coacervates serve as effective vehicles for pre-cisely delivering biomolecules, including bioactive neurotrophins, to the mouse striatum following intraparenchymal injection. These results support the use of trehalose-based coacervates as part of therapeutic protein delivery strategies for CNS disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryo-EM single particle analysis has recently facilitated the high-resolution structural determination of numerous GPCR-G complexes. Diverse methodologies have been devised with this trend, and in the case of GPCR-Gi complexes, scFv16, an antibody that recognizes the intricate interface of the complex, has been mainly implemented to stabilize the complex. However, owing to their flexibility and heterogeneity, structural determinations of GPCR-Gi complexes remain both challenging and resource-intensive. By employing eGt, which exhibits binding affinity to modified nanobody Nb35, the cryo-EM structure of Rhodopsin-eGt complex was previously reported. Using this modified G protein, we determined the structure of the ETB-eGt complex bound to the modified Nb35. The determined structure of ETB receptor was the same as the previously reported ETB-Gi complex, and the resulting dataset demonstrated significantly improved anisotropy. This modified G protein will be utilized for the structural determination of other GPCR-Gi complexes.

HighlightsO_LIThe study introduces the engineered G protein subunit eGT, which enhances the resolution of GPCR-G protein structures by suppressing G protein conformational fluctuations and is particularly beneficial for Gi-coupled receptors.
C_LIO_LIThe cryo-EM structure of the ETB receptor complexed with eGt-Nb35 reveals improved map quality, reduced anisotropy, and isotropic density distribution, increasing the accuracy of structural analysis.
C_LIO_LIStructural comparison between ETB-Gi and ETB-eGt reveals similar receptor-G protein interactions, demonstrating the utility of eGt-Nb35 for studying GPCR-Gi complexes and the potential for broader applications within the Gi family.

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues is vital for regenerative medicine in tissue engineering. This study investigated the changes in Young&#39;s modulus (YM), storage modulus (E&#39;), loss modulus (E&#34;), and porosity of native and decellularized bovine reproductive tissues during the estrous cycle. Testis tunica albuginea had significantly higher YM, E&#39;, and E&#34; than the inner testis, indicating greater stiffness and viscoelasticity. Endometrium showed no distinct differences in YM, E&#39;, or E&#39; across the estrous cycle or between horns. Ovaries exhibited significant variations in YM, E&#39;, E&#34;, and porosity, with higher YM and E&#39; in the ipsilateral cortex and medulla during the luteal phase. Decellularized ovarian tissues displayed increased porosity. The oviduct displayed no significant differences in YM or E&#39; in the isthmus, but the contralateral ampulla had reduced YM and E&#39; in the luteal phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues, facilitating the development of biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a complex ocular condition characterized by an unstable tear film and inadequate tear production, leading to tissue damage. Despite its common occurrence, there is currently no comprehensive in vitro model that accurately reproduce the cellular characteristics of DES. Here we modified a corneal epithelium-on-a-chip (CEpOC) model to recapitulate DES by subjecting HCE-T human corneal epithelial cells to an air-liquid (AL) interface stimulus. We then assessed the effects of AL stimulation both in the presence and absence of diclofenac (DCF). Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression changes in response to AL and AL_DCF, affecting pathways related to development, epithelial structure, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Both treatments upregulated PIEZO2, linked to corneal damage signaling, while downregulating OCLN, involved in cell-cell junctions. They increased the expression of inflammatory genes (e.g., IL6) and reduced mucin production genes (e.g., MUC16), reflecting dry eye characteristics. TGFB1, crucial for corneal wound healing, was slightly downregulated in AL_DCF, potentially affecting wound healing processes rather than reducing inflammation by DCF. Metabolomic analysis showed increased secretion of metabolites associated with cell damage and inflammation (e.g., methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid, lauroyl-carnitine) in response to AL and even more with AL_DCF, indicating a shift in cellular metabolism. This study showcases the utilization of AL stimulus within the CEpOC as a comprehensive approach to faithfully reproduce the cellular characteristics of DES.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound-remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy-may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects&#39; visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structural analysis of guest molecules in rationally designed and self-assembling DNA crystals has proven elusive since its conception. Oligonucleotide frameworks provide an especially attractive route towards studying DNA-binding molecules by using three-dimensional lattices with defined sequence and structure. In this work, we site-specifically position a suite of minor groove binding molecules, and solve their structures via x-ray crystallography, as a proof-of-principle towards scaffolding larger guest species. Two crystal motifs were used to precisely immobilize the molecules DAPI, Hoechst, and netropsin at defined positions in the lattice, allowing us to control occupancy within the crystal. We also solved the structure of a three-ring imidazole-pyrrole-pyrrole polyamide molecule, which sequence-specifically packs in an anti-parallel dimeric arrangement within the minor groove. Finally, we engineered a crystal designed to position both netropsin and the polyamide at two distinct locations within the same lattice. Our work elucidates the design principles for the spatial arrangement of functional guests within lattices and opens new potential opportunities for the use of DNA crystals to display and structurally characterize small molecules, peptides, and ultimately proteins of un-known structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundKomagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) is a methylotropic commercially important non-conventional species of yeast that grows in a fermentor to exceptionally high densities on simple media and secretes recombinant proteins efficiently. Genetic engineering strategies are being explored in this organism to facilitate cost-effective biomanufacturing. Small, stable artificial chromosomes in K. phaffii could offer unique advantages by accommodating multiple integrations of extraneous genes and their promoters without accumulating perturbations of native chromosomes or exhausting the availability of selection markers.

ResultsHere, we describe a linear &#34;nano&#34;chromosome (of 15-25 kb) that, according to whole-genome sequencing, persists in K. phaffii over many generations with a copy number per cell of one, provided non-homologous end joining is compromised (by KU70-knockout). The nanochromosome includes a copy of the centromere from K. phaffii chromosome 3, a K. phaffii-derived autonomously replicating sequence on either side of the centromere, and a pair of K. phaffii-like telomeres. It contains, within its q arm, a landing zone in which genes of interest alternate with long (approx. 1-kb) non-coding DNA chosen to facilitate homologous recombination and serve as spacers. The landing zone can be extended along the nanochromosome, in an inch-worming mode of sequential gene integrations, accompanied by recycling of just two antibiotic-resistance markers. The nanochromosome was used to express PDI, a gene encoding protein disulfide isomerase. Co-expression with PDI allowed the production, from a genomically integrated gene, of secreted murine complement factor H, a plasma protein containing 40 disulfide bonds. As further proof-of-principle, we co-expressed, from a nanochromosome, both PDI and a gene for GFP-tagged human complement factor H under the control of PAOX1 and demonstrated that the secreted protein was active as a regulator of the complement system.

ConclusionsWe have added K. phaffii to the list of organisms that can produce human proteins from genes carried on a stable, linear, artificial chromosome. We envisage using nanochromosomes as repositories for numerous extraneous genes, allowing intensive engineering of K. phaffii without compromising its genome or weakening the resulting strain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bioelectronic fibers hold promise for both research and clinical applications due to their compactness, ease of implantation, and ability to incorporate various functionalities such as sensing and stimulation. However, existing devices suffer from bulkiness, rigidity, limited functionality, and low density of active components. These limitations stem from the difficulty to incorporate many components on one-dimensional (1D) fiber devices due to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (e.g., photolithography) with curved, thin and long fiber structures. Herein, we introduce a fabrication approach, &#34;spiral transformation&#39;&#39;, to convert two-dimensional (2D) films containing microfabricated devices into 1D soft fibers. This approach allows for the creation of high density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibers, termed Spiral NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control over the longitudinal, angular, and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. We show the utility of S-NeuroString for motility mapping, serotonin sensing, and tissue stimulation within the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal (GI) system, as well as for single-unit recordings in the brain. The described bioelectronic fibers hold great promises for next-generation multifunctional implantable electronics.</p>
