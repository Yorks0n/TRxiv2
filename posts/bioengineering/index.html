O.\nScore: 31.5, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562069\nThe brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cells activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-re-solved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.\nProgrammable delivery of fluoxetine via wearable bioelectronics for wound healing in vivo\nAuthors: Li, H.; Yang, H.-y.; Asefifeyzabadi, N.; Baniya, P.; Zlobina, K.; Hsieh, H.-C.; Nguyen, T.; Hernandez, C.; Carrion, H.; Tebyani, M.; Selberg, J.; Gomez, M.; Teodorescu, M.; Lopez, A. M.; Gallegos, A.; Zhu, K.; Recendez, C.; Luo, L.; Alhamo, M. A.; Norouzi, N.; Soulika, A. M.; Levin, M.; Zhao, M.; Isseroff, R. R.; Rolandi, M.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561754\nThe ability to deliver drugs with precise dosages at specific time points can significantly improve disease treatment while reducing side effects. Drug encapsulation for gradual delivery has opened up the doors for superior treatment regimen. To expand on this ability, programming bioelectronic devices to deliver small molecules enables ad-hoc personalized therapeutic profiles that are more complex than simple gradual release. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic bandage with an integrated electrophoretic ion pump that affords on-demand drug delivery with precise dose control. Delivery of fluoxetine to wounds in mice resulted in a 27.2% decrease in the macrophage ratio (M1/M2) and a 39.9% increase in re-epithelialization, indicating a shorter inflammatory phase and faster overall healing. Programmable drug delivery using wearable bioelectronics in wounds introduces a broadly applicable strategy for the long-term delivery of a prescribed treatment regimen with minimal external intervention.\nBiodesign of Frugal CRISPR Kits for Equitable and Accessible Education\nAuthors: Collins, M. C.; Lau, M. B.; Ma, W.; Shen, A.; La Russa, M.; Qi, L. S.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562372\nEquitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.\nExtracellular matrix sulfation in the tumor microenvironment stimulates cancer stemness and invasiveness\nAuthors: Kusoglu, A.; Ornek, D.; Dansik, A.; Uzun, C.; Ozkan, S.

Proteoglycans (PG) are vital regulators of cellular signaling in the ECM with ability to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation via their sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) side chains. However, their role on tumor cell behavior is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that PGs are heavily expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients in correlation with invasive phenotype and poor prognosis. We developed a bioengineered human lung tumor model which recapitulates the increase of sGAGs in tumors in an organotypic matrix with independent control of stiffness, viscoelasticity, ligand density and porosity. Our model reveals that increased sulfation stimulates extensive proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in cancer cells. We identified the FAK-PI3K-mTOR signaling axis as a mediator of sulfation-induced molecular changes in cells upon activation of a distinct set of RTKs within tumor-mimetic hydrogels. We demonstrate that the transcriptomic landscape of tumor cells in response to increased sulfation resembles native PG-rich patient tumors through employing integrative omics and network modeling approaches.\nLong-Term In Vivo Molecular Monitoring Using Aptamer-Graphene Microtransistors\nAuthors: Wu, G.; Zhang, E.

R.; Zhang, Y.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562080\nLong-term, real-time molecular monitoring in complex biological environments is critical for our ability to understand, prevent, diagnose, and manage human diseases. Aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors possess the promise due to their generalizability and a high degree of selectivity. Nevertheless, the operation of existing aptamer-based biosensors in vivo is limited to a few hours. Here, we report a first-generation long-term in vivo molecular monitoring platform, named aptamer-graphene microtransistors (AGMs). The AGM incorporates a layer of pyrene- (polyethylene glycol)5-alcohol and DNase inhibitor-doped polyacrylamide hydrogel coating to reduce biofouling and aptamer degradation. As a demonstration of function and generalizability, the AGM achieves the detection of biomolecules such as dopamine and serotonin in undiluted whole blood at 37 {degrees}C for 11 days. Furthermore, the AGM successfully captures optically evoked dopamine release in vivo in mice for over one week and demonstrates the capability to monitor behaviorally-induced endogenous dopamine release even after eight days of implantation in freely moving mice. The results reported in this work establish the potential for chronic aptamer-based molecular monitoring platforms, and thus serve as a new benchmark for molecular monitoring using aptamer-based technology.\nRemotely controlled drug release in deep brain regionsof non-human primates\nAuthors: Wilson, M. G.; Webb, T. D.; Odeen, H.; Kubanek, J.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561539\nMany areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound--remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy--may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.

E.; Jordan, J. H.; Thomas, A.; Friday, S. R.; Melendez, G. C.; Weis, J. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561881\nBackgroundThere is considerable focus on developing strategies for identifying subclinical cardiac decline prior to cardiac failure. Myocardial tissue elasticity changes may precede irreversible cardiac damage, providing promise for an early biomarker for cardiac decline. Biomarker strategies are of particular interest in cardio-oncology due to cardiotoxic effects of anti-neoplastic therapies, particularly anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics. Current clinical methods for diagnosing cardiotoxicity are too coarse to identify cardiac decline early enough for meaningful therapeutic intervention, or too cumbersome for clinical implementation. MethodsUtilizing changes in myocardial elasticity as a biomarker for subclinical cardiac decline, we developed a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to estimate spatial maps of left ventricle (LV) myocardial elasticity. In this study, we employ this methodology to assess changes in LV elasticity in a non-human primate model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of five African Green monkeys was acquired at baseline prior to doxorubicin administration, 6-weeks, and 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose and histopathological samples of the LV were taken at 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose. Spatial elasticity maps of the mid-short axis plane of the LV were estimated at each image acquisition. Global and regional LV elasticity were calculated and changes between imaging time points was assessed. LV elasticity at baseline and final time point were compared to cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements calculated from histopathological staining of archived tissue bank samples and study endpoint tissue samples utilizing Pearsons correlation coefficients. ResultsWe identify significant changes in LV elasticity between each imaging time point both globally and regionally. We also demonstrate strong correlation between LV elasticity and cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements. Results indicate that LV elasticity estimates calculated using BEIM correlate with histopathological changes that occur due to doxorubicin administration, validating LV elasticity solutions and providing significant promise for use of BEIM to non-invasively elucidate cardiac injury. ConclusionsThis methodology can show progressive changes in LV elasticity and has potential to be a more sensitive indicator of elasticity changes than current clinical measures of cardiotoxicity. LV elasticity may provide a valuable biomarker for cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics and cardiac disease detection.\nDeep learning-based aberration compensation improves contrast and resolution in fluorescence microscopy\nAuthors: Guo, M.; Wu, Y.; Su, Y.; Qian, S.; Krueger, E.; Christensen, R.; Kroeschell, G.; Bui, J.; Chaw, M.; Zhang, L.; Liu, J.; Hou, X.; Han, X.; Ma, X.; Zhovmer, A.; Combs, C.; Moyle, M.; Yemini, E.; Liu, H.; Liu, Z.; La Riviere, P.; Colon-Ramos, D.; Shroff, H.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562439\nOptical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics into the imaging path. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations to show that applying the trained de-aberration networks outperforms alternative methods, and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos.\nUsing a micro-device with a deformable ceiling to probe stiffness heterogeneities within 3D cell aggregates\nAuthors: Jain, S.; Belkadi, H.; Michaut, A.; Sart, S.; Gros, J.; Genet, M.; Baroud, C. N.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.559477\nRecent advances in the field of mechanobiology have led to the development of methods to characterize single-cell or monolayer mechanical properties and link them to their functional behaviour. However, there remains a strong need to establish this link for three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, which better mimic tissue function. Here we present a platform to actuate and observe many such aggregates within one deformable micro-device. The platform consists of a single PDMS piece cast on a 3D-printed mold and bonded to a glass slide or coverslip. It consists of a chamber containing cell spheroids, which is adjacent to air cavities that are fluidically independent. Controlling the air pressure in these air cavities leads to a vertical displacement of the chambers ceiling. The device can be used in static or dynamic modes over time-scales of seconds to hours, with displacement amplitudes from a few m to several tens of microns. Further, we show how the compression protocols can be used to obtain measurements of stiffness heterogeneities within individual co-culture spheroids, by comparing image correlations of spheroids at different levels of compression with finite element simulations. The labeling of the cells and their cytoskeleton is combined with image correlation methods to relate the structure of the co-culture spheroid with its mechanical properties at different locations. The device is compatible with various microscopy techniques, including confocal microscopy, which can be used to observe the displacements and rearrangements of single cells and neighborhoods within the aggregate. The complete experimental and imaging platform can now be used to provide multi-scale measurements that link single-cell behavior with the global mechanical response of the aggregates.\nThe Effect of Synthetic Training Data on the Performance of a Deep Learning Based Markerless Biomechanics System\nAuthors: Templin, T. N.; Eliason, T. D.; Medjaouri, O.; Chambers, D.; Saylor, K.; Nicolella, D. P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.562758\nAs markerless motion capture technologies develop and mature, there is an increasing demand from the biomechanics community to provide kinematic data with the same level of accuracy as current gold standard methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how adding synthetic data to the training dataset of a deep learning based markerless biomechanics system impacts the accuracy of kinematic measurements during two functional movements. Synchronized video from multiple camera views was captured along with marker- based data from 9 subjects who performed 3 repetitions of countermovement jumps and squats. Including synthetic data to the training reduced lower limb error on average by 65.1% and 70.1% for the countermovement jump and squat movements, respectively. These results demonstrate the promising utility of supplementing the training of a deep learning markerless motion capture system with synthetic data.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cells activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-re-solved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to deliver drugs with precise dosages at specific time points can significantly improve disease treatment while reducing side effects. Drug encapsulation for gradual delivery has opened up the doors for superior treatment regimen. To expand on this ability, programming bioelectronic devices to deliver small molecules enables ad-hoc personalized therapeutic profiles that are more complex than simple gradual release. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic bandage with an integrated electrophoretic ion pump that affords on-demand drug delivery with precise dose control. Delivery of fluoxetine to wounds in mice resulted in a 27.2% decrease in the macrophage ratio (M1/M2) and a 39.9% increase in re-epithelialization, indicating a shorter inflammatory phase and faster overall healing. Programmable drug delivery using wearable bioelectronics in wounds introduces a broadly applicable strategy for the long-term delivery of a prescribed treatment regimen with minimal external intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Equitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor extracellular matrices (ECM) exhibit aberrant changes in composition and mechanics compared to normal tissues. Proteoglycans (PG) are vital regulators of cellular signaling in the ECM with ability to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation via their sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) side chains. However, their role on tumor cell behavior is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that PGs are heavily expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients in correlation with invasive phenotype and poor prognosis. We developed a bioengineered human lung tumor model which recapitulates the increase of sGAGs in tumors in an organotypic matrix with independent control of stiffness, viscoelasticity, ligand density and porosity. Our model reveals that increased sulfation stimulates extensive proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in cancer cells. We identified the FAK-PI3K-mTOR signaling axis as a mediator of sulfation-induced molecular changes in cells upon activation of a distinct set of RTKs within tumor-mimetic hydrogels. We demonstrate that the transcriptomic landscape of tumor cells in response to increased sulfation resembles native PG-rich patient tumors through employing integrative omics and network modeling approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long-term, real-time molecular monitoring in complex biological environments is critical for our ability to understand, prevent, diagnose, and manage human diseases. Aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors possess the promise due to their generalizability and a high degree of selectivity. Nevertheless, the operation of existing aptamer-based biosensors in vivo is limited to a few hours. Here, we report a first-generation long-term in vivo molecular monitoring platform, named aptamer-graphene microtransistors (AGMs). The AGM incorporates a layer of pyrene- (polyethylene glycol)5-alcohol and DNase inhibitor-doped polyacrylamide hydrogel coating to reduce biofouling and aptamer degradation. As a demonstration of function and generalizability, the AGM achieves the detection of biomolecules such as dopamine and serotonin in undiluted whole blood at 37 {degrees}C for 11 days. Furthermore, the AGM successfully captures optically evoked dopamine release in vivo in mice for over one week and demonstrates the capability to monitor behaviorally-induced endogenous dopamine release even after eight days of implantation in freely moving mice. The results reported in this work establish the potential for chronic aptamer-based molecular monitoring platforms, and thus serve as a new benchmark for molecular monitoring using aptamer-based technology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound--remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy--may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is considerable focus on developing strategies for identifying subclinical cardiac decline prior to cardiac failure. Myocardial tissue elasticity changes may precede irreversible cardiac damage, providing promise for an early biomarker for cardiac decline. Biomarker strategies are of particular interest in cardio-oncology due to cardiotoxic effects of anti-neoplastic therapies, particularly anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics. Current clinical methods for diagnosing cardiotoxicity are too coarse to identify cardiac decline early enough for meaningful therapeutic intervention, or too cumbersome for clinical implementation.

MethodsUtilizing changes in myocardial elasticity as a biomarker for subclinical cardiac decline, we developed a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to estimate spatial maps of left ventricle (LV) myocardial elasticity. In this study, we employ this methodology to assess changes in LV elasticity in a non-human primate model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of five African Green monkeys was acquired at baseline prior to doxorubicin administration, 6-weeks, and 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose and histopathological samples of the LV were taken at 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose. Spatial elasticity maps of the mid-short axis plane of the LV were estimated at each image acquisition. Global and regional LV elasticity were calculated and changes between imaging time points was assessed. LV elasticity at baseline and final time point were compared to cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements calculated from histopathological staining of archived tissue bank samples and study endpoint tissue samples utilizing Pearsons correlation coefficients.

ResultsWe identify significant changes in LV elasticity between each imaging time point both globally and regionally. We also demonstrate strong correlation between LV elasticity and cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements. Results indicate that LV elasticity estimates calculated using BEIM correlate with histopathological changes that occur due to doxorubicin administration, validating LV elasticity solutions and providing significant promise for use of BEIM to non-invasively elucidate cardiac injury.

ConclusionsThis methodology can show progressive changes in LV elasticity and has potential to be a more sensitive indicator of elasticity changes than current clinical measures of cardiotoxicity. LV elasticity may provide a valuable biomarker for cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics and cardiac disease detection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Optical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics into the imaging path. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations to show that applying the trained de-aberration networks outperforms alternative methods, and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in the field of mechanobiology have led to the development of methods to characterize single-cell or monolayer mechanical properties and link them to their functional behaviour. However, there remains a strong need to establish this link for three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, which better mimic tissue function. Here we present a platform to actuate and observe many such aggregates within one deformable micro-device. The platform consists of a single PDMS piece cast on a 3D-printed mold and bonded to a glass slide or coverslip. It consists of a chamber containing cell spheroids, which is adjacent to air cavities that are fluidically independent. Controlling the air pressure in these air cavities leads to a vertical displacement of the chambers ceiling. The device can be used in static or dynamic modes over time-scales of seconds to hours, with displacement amplitudes from a few m to several tens of microns. Further, we show how the compression protocols can be used to obtain measurements of stiffness heterogeneities within individual co-culture spheroids, by comparing image correlations of spheroids at different levels of compression with finite element simulations. The labeling of the cells and their cytoskeleton is combined with image correlation methods to relate the structure of the co-culture spheroid with its mechanical properties at different locations. The device is compatible with various microscopy techniques, including confocal microscopy, which can be used to observe the displacements and rearrangements of single cells and neighborhoods within the aggregate. The complete experimental and imaging platform can now be used to provide multi-scale measurements that link single-cell behavior with the global mechanical response of the aggregates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As markerless motion capture technologies develop and mature, there is an increasing demand from the biomechanics community to provide kinematic data with the same level of accuracy as current gold standard methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how adding synthetic data to the training dataset of a deep learning based markerless biomechanics system impacts the accuracy of kinematic measurements during two functional movements. Synchronized video from multiple camera views was captured along with marker- based data from 9 subjects who performed 3 repetitions of countermovement jumps and squats. Including synthetic data to the training reduced lower limb error on average by 65.1% and 70.1% for the countermovement jump and squat movements, respectively. These results demonstrate the promising utility of supplementing the training of a deep learning markerless motion capture system with synthetic data.</p>
