M.; Triesscheijn, C. S.; Monica, B.; Paspali, I.; Tielemans, M.; Francois, J. J.; Seinen, C. W.; de Jong, O. G.; Kooijmans, S. A.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563755\nIntercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been identified as a vital component of a steadily expanding number of physiological and pathological processes. To accommodate these roles, EVs are equipped with specific proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules by EV-secreting cells. Consequently, EVs have highly heterogeneous molecular compositions. Given that surface molecules on EVs determine their interactions with their environment, it is conceivable that EV functionality differs between subpopulations with varying surface compositions. However, it has been technically challenging to examine such functional heterogeneity due to a lack of non-destructive methods to separate EV subpopulations based on their surface markers. Here, we used Design-of-Experiments methodology to rapidly optimize a protocol, which we name EV-Elute, to elute intact EVs from commercially available Protein G-coated magnetic beads. We captured EVs from various cell types on these beads using antibodies against CD9, CD63, CD81 and a custom-made protein binding phosphatidylserine (PS). When applying EV-Elute, over 70% of bound EVs could be recovered from the beads in a pH- and incubation time-dependent fashion. EV subpopulations were found to be devoid of co-isolated protein contaminants observed in whole EV isolates and showed intact morphology by electron microscopy. Proteinase K protection assays showed a mild and reversible decrease of EV membrane integrity during elution. Depending on the type of capturing antibody used, some antibodies remained EV-associated after elution. EV subpopulations showed uptake patterns similar to whole EV isolates in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. However, in Cas9/sgRNA delivery assays, CD63+ EVs showed a lower capacity to functionally deliver cargo as compared to CD9+, CD81+ and PS+ EVs. Taken together, we developed a novel, easy-to-use platform to isolate and functionally compare surface marker-defined EV subpopulations. Importantly, this platform does not require specialized equipment or reagents and is universally applicable to any capturing antibody and EV source. Hence, EV-Elute can open new opportunities to study EV functionality at the subpopulation level.\nHow to prevent endothelial cells from losing their edge: a simple patterning of development-like matrix guides a microvessel morphogenetic process by self-organization\nAuthors: Monroy-Romero, A. X.; Nieto-Rivera, B.; Xiao, W.; Hautefeuille, M.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564881\nVascular engineering seeks to generate reliable models for studying cellular interactions in the context of preserving homeostasis and disease development. However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.\nHigh-throughput, label-free detection of DNA origami in single-cell suspensions using origamiFISH-Flow\nAuthors: Alexander, S.; Wang, W. X.; Tseng, C.-Y.; Douglas, T. R.; Chou, L. Y. T.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564845\nStructural DNA nanotechnology enables custom fabrication of nanoscale devices and promises diverse biological applications. However, the effects of design on DNA nanostructure (DN)-cell interactions in vitro and in vivo are not yet well-characterized. origamiFISH is a recently developed technique for imaging DNs in cells and tissues. Compared to the use of fluorescent tags, origamiFISH offers label-free and structure-agnostic detection of DNs with significantly improved sensitivity. Here, we extend the origamiFISH technique to quantifying DNs in single-cell suspensions, including nonadherent cells such as subsets of immune cells, via readout by flow cytometry. This method, referred to as origamiFISH-Flow, is high-throughput (e.g., 10,000 cells per second) and compatible with immunostaining for concurrent cell-type and -state characterization. We demonstrate that origamiFISH-Flow enhances signal-to-noise ratio by up to 20-fold compared to dye labeling approaches, leading to the capture of \u003e25-fold more DN+ cells at low, single-picomolar DN uptake concentrations. We additionally show the use of origamiFISH-Flow to profile cell-type and shape-specific DN uptake patterns across cell lines and splenocytes and quantify in vivo DN accumulation in lymphoid organs. Together, origamiFISH-Flow offers a new tool to interrogate DN interactions with cells and tissues, while providing insights for tailoring their designs in bio-applications.\nA human pluripotent stem cell-based somitogenesis model using microfluidics\nAuthors: Liu, Y.; Kim, Y. S.; Xue, X.; Kobayashi, N.; Sun, S.; Yang, Q.; Pourquie, O.; Fu, J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564399\nEmerging human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based embryo models are useful for studying human embryogenesis. Particularly, there are hPSC-based somitogenesis models using free-floating culture that recapitulate somite formation. Somitogenesis in vivo involves intricately orchestrated bio-chemical and -mechanical events. However, none of the current somitogenesis models controls biochemical gradients or biomechanical signals in the culture, limiting their applicability to untangle complex biochemical-biomechanical interactions that drive somitogenesis. Here we report a new human somitogenesis model by confining hPSC-derived presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissues in microfabricated trenches. Exogenous microfluidic morphogen gradients imposed on PSM cause axial patterning and trigger spontaneous rostral-to-caudal somite formation. A mechanical theory is developed to explain the size dependency between somites and PSM. The microfluidic somitogenesis model is further exploited to reveal regulatory roles of cellular and tissue biomechanics in somite formation. This study presents a useful microengineered, hPSC-based model for understanding the bio-chemical and -mechanical events that guide somite formation.\nEctopic adipogenesis in response to injury and material implantation in an autoimmune mouse model\nAuthors: Ngo, T. B.; Josyula, A.; DeStefano, S.; Fertil, D.; Faust, M.; Lokwani, R.; Sadtler, K.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561105\nDue to the limited capacity of mammals to regenerate complex tissues, researchers have worked to understand the mechanisms of tissue regeneration in organisms that maintain that capacity. One example is the MRL/MpJ mouse strain with unique regenerative capacity in ear pinnae that is absent from other strains, such as the common C57BL/6 strain. The MRL/MpJ mouse has also been associated with an autoimmune phenotype even in the absence of the mutant Fas gene described in its parent strain MRL/lpr. Due to these findings, we evaluated the differences between the responses of MRL/MpJ versus C57BL/6 strain in traumatic muscle injury and subsequent material implantation. One salient feature of the MRL/MpJ response to injury was a robust adipogenesis within the muscle. This was associated with a decrease in M2-like polarization in response to biologically derived extracellular matrix scaffolds. In pro-fibrotic materials, such as polyethylene, there were fewer foreign body giant cells in the MRL/MpJ mice. As there are reports of both positive and negative influences of adipose tissue and adipogenesis on wound healing, this model could provide an important lens to investigate the interplay between stem cells, adipose tissue, and immune responses in trauma and materials implantation.\nTRILL: Orchestrating Modular Deep-Learning Workflows for Democratized, Scalable Protein Analysis and Engineering\nAuthors: Martinez, Z. A.; Murray, R. M.; Thomson, M. W.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563881\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep-learning models have been rapidly adopted by many fields, partly due to the deluge of data humanity has amassed. In particular, the petabases of biological sequencing data enable the unsupervised training of protein language models that learn the \"language of life.\" However, due to their prohibitive size and complexity, contemporary deep-learning models are often unwieldy, especially for scientists with limited machine learning backgrounds. TRILL (TRaining and Inference using the Language of Life) is a platform for creative protein design and discovery. Leveraging several state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, DiffDock, and RFDiffusion, TRILL allows researchers to generate novel proteins, predict 3-D structures, extract high-dimensional representations of proteins, functionally classify proteins and more. What sets TRILL apart is its ability to enable complex pipelines by chaining together models and effectively merging the capabilities of different models to achieve a sum greater than its individual parts. Whether using Google Colab with one GPU or a supercomputer with hundreds, TRILL allows scientists to effectively utilize models with millions to billions of parameters by using optimized training strategies such as ZeRO-Offload and distributed data parallel. Therefore, TRILL not only bridges the gap between complex deep-learning models and their practical application in the field of biology, but also simplifies the orchestration of these models into comprehensive workflows, democratizing access to powerful methods.

C.; Grindel, S. H.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.564017\nHuman organoids are a promising approach for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, organoid variability and limited control over morphological outcomes remain significant challenges. Here we extend a DNA velcro cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells. We demonstrate long-term control over organoid size and morphology, decoupled from geometric constraints.\nWeakly alkaline conditions degrade aflatoxins through lactone ring opening\nAuthors: Sandlin, N.; Lee, J.; Zaccaria, M.; Domin, M.; Momeni, B.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564999\nAflatoxins (AFs) are fungal metabolites that ubiquitously contaminate many common food crops and contribute to major foodborne diseases in humans and animals. The ability to remove AFs from common food and feed commodities will improve health standards and limit the economic impact inflicted by AF food contamination. Known chemical strategies have used strong acids and bases to remove contaminating AF, but these methods often lead to ecological waste issues downstream. In this study, we explore the application of weaker acidic and alkaline conditions to removes two types of AFs, AFB1 and AFG2. We find that a pH 9 buffered environment reduces AFB1 and AFG2 by more than 50% and 95%, respectively, within 24 hours. We show that AF degradation is through lactone ring opening, which is a known cause of AF toxicity, and provide a potential structure of the AFG2 degradation byproduct. Further, we confirm that incubation in the pH 9 environment reduces the genotoxicity of AFB1. Our findings indicate that a weakly alkaline environment may adequately detoxify AF-contaminated food or feed without the need to apply stronger or harsher basic conditions.\nAI-powered smart glasses for sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments\nAuthors: Rossos, D.; Mihailidis, A.; Laschowski, B.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563804\nEnvironment sensing and recognition can allow humans and robots to dynamically adapt to different walking terrains. However, fast and accurate visual perception is challenging, especially on embedded devices with limited computational resources. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel pair of AI-powered smart glasses for onboard sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments with high accuracy and low latency. We used a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and an ArduCam HM0360 low-power camera, both of which interface with the eyeglass frames using 3D-printed mounts that we custom-designed. We trained and optimized a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network using a MobileNetV1 backbone to classify the walking terrain as either indoor surfaces, outdoor surfaces (grass and dirt), or outdoor surfaces (paved) using over 62,500 egocentric images that we adapted and manually labelled from the Meta Ego4D dataset. We then compiled and deployed our deep learning model using TensorFlow Lite Micro and post-training quantization to create a minimized byte array model of size 0.31MB. Our system was able to accurately predict complex walking environments with 93.6% classification accuracy and had an embedded inference speed of 1.5 seconds during online experiments using the integrated camera and microcontroller. Our AI-powered smart glasses open new opportunities for visual perception of human-robot walking environments where embedded inference and a low form factor is required. Future research will focus on improving the onboard inference speed and miniaturization of the mechatronic components.\nZNF865 Regulates Senescence and Cell Cycle for Applications to Cell Engineering and Gene Therapy\nAuthors: Levis, H.; Lewis, C.; Stockham, E.; Weston, J. D.; Lawal, A.; Lawrence, B.; Gullbrand, S. E.; Bowles, R. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563801\nZinc finger (ZNF) proteins represent the largest group of regulatory proteins within eukaryotic genomes. However, despite their broad regulatory function, the majority of ZNF protein function remains unknown. Recently, we discovered ZNF865, which has no in-depth publications and has not been functionally characterized. Utilizing CRISPR-guided gene modulation, we show that ZNF865 regulates key cellular and molecular processes associated with healthy cell function by primarily regulating cellular senescence, cell cycle progression, and protein processing. As a result, regulating this gene acts as a primary titratable regulator of cell activity, and we demonstrate the potential of targeted ZNF865 regulation as a tool to control senescence and protein production in multiple clinically relevant cell types for cell engineering/tissue engineering/gene therapy applications. We demonstrate its ability to rescue human senescent cell populations, boost T-cell activity, and dramatically deposit more cartilaginous tissue in a whole organ tissue-engineered intervertebral disc. Overall, we present novel biology and regulatory mechanisms of senescence and cell cycle that were previously unknown and display the power of CRISPR-cell engineering to enhance cell engineering strategies treating disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been identified as a vital component of a steadily expanding number of physiological and pathological processes. To accommodate these roles, EVs are equipped with specific proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules by EV-secreting cells. Consequently, EVs have highly heterogeneous molecular compositions. Given that surface molecules on EVs determine their interactions with their environment, it is conceivable that EV functionality differs between subpopulations with varying surface compositions. However, it has been technically challenging to examine such functional heterogeneity due to a lack of non-destructive methods to separate EV subpopulations based on their surface markers. Here, we used Design-of-Experiments methodology to rapidly optimize a protocol, which we name  EV-Elute, to elute intact EVs from commercially available Protein G-coated magnetic beads. We captured EVs from various cell types on these beads using antibodies against CD9, CD63, CD81 and a custom-made protein binding phosphatidylserine (PS). When applying EV-Elute, over 70% of bound EVs could be recovered from the beads in a pH- and incubation time-dependent fashion. EV subpopulations were found to be devoid of co-isolated protein contaminants observed in whole EV isolates and showed intact morphology by electron microscopy. Proteinase K protection assays showed a mild and reversible decrease of EV membrane integrity during elution. Depending on the type of capturing antibody used, some antibodies remained EV-associated after elution. EV subpopulations showed uptake patterns similar to whole EV isolates in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. However, in Cas9/sgRNA delivery assays, CD63&#43; EVs showed a lower capacity to functionally deliver cargo as compared to CD9&#43;, CD81&#43; and PS&#43; EVs. Taken together, we developed a novel, easy-to-use platform to isolate and functionally compare surface marker-defined EV subpopulations. Importantly, this platform does not require specialized equipment or reagents and is universally applicable to any capturing antibody and EV source. Hence, EV-Elute can open new opportunities to study EV functionality at the subpopulation level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vascular engineering seeks to generate reliable models for studying cellular interactions in the context of preserving homeostasis and disease development. However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural DNA nanotechnology enables custom fabrication of nanoscale devices and promises diverse biological applications. However, the effects of design on DNA nanostructure (DN)-cell interactions in vitro and in vivo are not yet well-characterized. origamiFISH is a recently developed technique for imaging DNs in cells and tissues. Compared to the use of fluorescent tags, origamiFISH offers label-free and structure-agnostic detection of DNs with significantly improved sensitivity. Here, we extend the origamiFISH technique to quantifying DNs in single-cell suspensions, including nonadherent cells such as subsets of immune cells, via readout by flow cytometry. This method, referred to as origamiFISH-Flow, is high-throughput (e.g., 10,000 cells per second) and compatible with immunostaining for concurrent cell-type and -state characterization. We demonstrate that origamiFISH-Flow enhances signal-to-noise ratio by up to 20-fold compared to dye labeling approaches, leading to the capture of &gt;25-fold more DN&#43; cells at low, single-picomolar DN uptake concentrations. We additionally show the use of origamiFISH-Flow to profile cell-type and shape-specific DN uptake patterns across cell lines and splenocytes and quantify in vivo DN accumulation in lymphoid organs. Together, origamiFISH-Flow offers a new tool to interrogate DN interactions with cells and tissues, while providing insights for tailoring their designs in bio-applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emerging human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based embryo models are useful for studying human embryogenesis. Particularly, there are hPSC-based somitogenesis models using free-floating culture that recapitulate somite formation. Somitogenesis in vivo involves intricately orchestrated bio-chemical and -mechanical events. However, none of the current somitogenesis models controls biochemical gradients or biomechanical signals in the culture, limiting their applicability to untangle complex biochemical-biomechanical interactions that drive somitogenesis. Here we report a new human somitogenesis model by confining hPSC-derived presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissues in microfabricated trenches. Exogenous microfluidic morphogen gradients imposed on PSM cause axial patterning and trigger spontaneous rostral-to-caudal somite formation. A mechanical theory is developed to explain the size dependency between somites and PSM. The microfluidic somitogenesis model is further exploited to reveal regulatory roles of cellular and tissue biomechanics in somite formation. This study presents a useful microengineered, hPSC-based model for understanding the bio-chemical and -mechanical events that guide somite formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to the limited capacity of mammals to regenerate complex tissues, researchers have worked to understand the mechanisms of tissue regeneration in organisms that maintain that capacity. One example is the MRL/MpJ mouse strain with unique regenerative capacity in ear pinnae that is absent from other strains, such as the common C57BL/6 strain. The MRL/MpJ mouse has also been associated with an autoimmune phenotype even in the absence of the mutant Fas gene described in its parent strain MRL/lpr. Due to these findings, we evaluated the differences between the responses of MRL/MpJ versus C57BL/6 strain in traumatic muscle injury and subsequent material implantation. One salient feature of the MRL/MpJ response to injury was a robust adipogenesis within the muscle. This was associated with a decrease in M2-like polarization in response to biologically derived extracellular matrix scaffolds. In pro-fibrotic materials, such as polyethylene, there were fewer foreign body giant cells in the MRL/MpJ mice. As there are reports of both positive and negative influences of adipose tissue and adipogenesis on wound healing, this model could provide an important lens to investigate the interplay between stem cells, adipose tissue, and immune responses in trauma and materials implantation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep-learning models have been rapidly adopted by many fields, partly due to the deluge of data humanity has amassed. In particular, the petabases of biological sequencing data enable the unsupervised training of protein language models that learn the &#34;language of life.&#34; However, due to their prohibitive size and complexity, contemporary deep-learning models are often unwieldy, especially for scientists with limited machine learning backgrounds. TRILL (TRaining and Inference using the Language of Life) is a platform for creative protein design and discovery. Leveraging several state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, DiffDock, and RFDiffusion, TRILL allows researchers to generate novel proteins, predict 3-D structures, extract high-dimensional representations of proteins, functionally classify proteins and more. What sets TRILL apart is its ability to enable complex pipelines by chaining together models and effectively merging the capabilities of different models to achieve a sum greater than its individual parts. Whether using Google Colab with one GPU or a supercomputer with hundreds, TRILL allows scientists to effectively utilize models with millions to billions of parameters by using optimized training strategies such as ZeRO-Offload and distributed data parallel. Therefore, TRILL not only bridges the gap between complex deep-learning models and their practical application in the field of biology, but also simplifies the orchestration of these models into comprehensive workflows, democratizing access to powerful methods.

Here we extend a DNA  velcro cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells.

        <p class="abstract">Aflatoxins (AFs) are fungal metabolites that ubiquitously contaminate many common food crops and contribute to major foodborne diseases in humans and animals. The ability to remove AFs from common food and feed commodities will improve health standards and limit the economic impact inflicted by AF food contamination. Known chemical strategies have used strong acids and bases to remove contaminating AF, but these methods often lead to ecological waste issues downstream. In this study, we explore the application of weaker acidic and alkaline conditions to removes two types of AFs, AFB1 and AFG2. We find that a pH 9 buffered environment reduces AFB1 and AFG2 by more than 50% and 95%, respectively, within 24 hours. We show that AF degradation is through lactone ring opening, which is a known cause of AF toxicity, and provide a potential structure of the AFG2 degradation byproduct. Further, we confirm that incubation in the pH 9 environment reduces the genotoxicity of AFB1. Our findings indicate that a weakly alkaline environment may adequately detoxify AF-contaminated food or feed without the need to apply stronger or harsher basic conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environment sensing and recognition can allow humans and robots to dynamically adapt to different walking terrains. However, fast and accurate visual perception is challenging, especially on embedded devices with limited computational resources. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel pair of AI-powered smart glasses for onboard sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments with high accuracy and low latency. We used a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and an ArduCam HM0360 low-power camera, both of which interface with the eyeglass frames using 3D-printed mounts that we custom-designed. We trained and optimized a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network using a MobileNetV1 backbone to classify the walking terrain as either indoor surfaces, outdoor surfaces (grass and dirt), or outdoor surfaces (paved) using over 62,500 egocentric images that we adapted and manually labelled from the Meta Ego4D dataset. We then compiled and deployed our deep learning model using TensorFlow Lite Micro and post-training quantization to create a minimized byte array model of size 0.31MB. Our system was able to accurately predict complex walking environments with 93.6% classification accuracy and had an embedded inference speed of 1.5 seconds during online experiments using the integrated camera and microcontroller. Our AI-powered smart glasses open new opportunities for visual perception of human-robot walking environments where embedded inference and a low form factor is required. Future research will focus on improving the onboard inference speed and miniaturization of the mechatronic components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zinc finger (ZNF) proteins represent the largest group of regulatory proteins within eukaryotic genomes. However, despite their broad regulatory function, the majority of ZNF protein function remains unknown. Recently, we discovered ZNF865, which has no in-depth publications and has not been functionally characterized. Utilizing CRISPR-guided gene modulation, we show that ZNF865 regulates key cellular and molecular processes associated with healthy cell function by primarily regulating cellular senescence, cell cycle progression, and protein processing. As a result, regulating this gene acts as a primary titratable regulator of cell activity, and we demonstrate the potential of targeted ZNF865 regulation as a tool to control senescence and protein production in multiple clinically relevant cell types for cell engineering/tissue engineering/gene therapy applications. We demonstrate its ability to rescue human senescent cell populations, boost T-cell activity, and dramatically deposit more cartilaginous tissue in a whole organ tissue-engineered intervertebral disc. Overall, we present novel biology and regulatory mechanisms of senescence and cell cycle that were previously unknown and display the power of CRISPR-cell engineering to enhance cell engineering strategies treating disease.</p>
