Leveraging this phenomenon and the exceptionally fast endocytosis rate of TfR, we introduce Transferrin Receptor TArgeting Chimeras (TransTAC), a novel molecular archetype for membrane protein degradation in cancers and other cell types. TransTACs repurpose the naturally recycling receptor TfR1 for protein degradation. To accomplish this, we utilized a combination of protein engineering strategies to redirect the target protein from recycling-endosome trafficking to lysosomal degradation. We show that TransTACs can highly efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native, or synthetic membrane proteins, establishing new possibilities for targeted cancer therapy.\nVolumetric imaging of an intact organism by a distributed molecular network\nAuthors: Weinstein, J. A.; Qian, N.\nScore: 31.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553025\nLymphatic, nervous, and tumoral tissues, among others, exhibit physiology that emerges from three-dimensional interactions between genetically unique cells. A technology capable of volumetrically imaging transcriptomes, genotypes, and morphologies in a single de novo measurement would therefore provide a critical view into the biological complexity of living systems. Here we achieve this by extending DNA microscopy, an imaging modality that encodes a spatio-genetic map of a specimen via a massive distributed network of DNA molecules inside it, to three dimensions and multiple length scales in developing zebrafish embryos.\nConditional Protein Denoising Diffusion Generates Programmable Endonucleases\nAuthors: Zhou, B.; Zheng, L.; Wu, B.; Yi, K.; Zhong, B.; Lio, P.; Hong, L.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552783\nComputation or deep learning-based functional protein generation methods address the urgent demand for novel biocatalysts, allowing for precise tailoring of functionalities to meet specific requirements. This emergence leads to the creation of highly efficient and specialized proteins with wide-ranging applications in scientific, technological, and biomedical domains. This study establishes a conditional protein diffusion model, namely CPDiffusion, to deliver diverse protein sequences with desired functions. While the model is free from extensive training data and the sampling process involves little guidance on the type of generated amino acids, CPDiffusion effectively secures essential highly conserved residues that are crucial for protein functionalities. We employed CPDiffusion and generated 27 artificially designed Argonaute proteins, programmable endonucleases applied for easy-to-implement and high-throughput screenings in gene editing and molecular diagnostics, that mutated approximately 200-400 amino acids with 40% sequence identities to those from nature. Experimental tests demonstrate the solubility of all 27 artificially-designed proteins (AP), with 24 of them displaying DNA cleavage activity. Remarkably, 74% of active APs exhibited superior activity compared to the template protein, and the most effective one showcased a remarkable nearly nine-fold enhancement of enzymatic activity. Moreover, 37% of APs exhibited enhanced thermostability. These findings emphasize CPDiffusion's remarkable capability to generate long-sequence proteins in a single step while retaining or enhancing intricate functionality. This approach facilitates the design of intricate enzymes featuring multi-domain molecular structures through in silico generation and throughput, all accomplished without the need for supervision from labeled data.\nSimulated musculoskeletal optimization for sprinting and marathon running\nAuthors: Van Wouwe, T.; Hicks, J.; Delp, S.; Liu, K.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552222\nMusculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes vary widely in the population and are intricately linked to the performance of tasks ranging from walking and running to jumping and sprinting. However, our ability to understand how these parameters affect task performance has been limited due to the high computational cost of modelling the necessary complexity of the musculoskeletal system and solving the requisite multi-dimensional optimization problem. For example, sprinting and running are fundamental to many forms of sport, but past research on the relationships between musculoskeletal geometry, muscle volumes, and running performance has been limited to observational studies, which have not established cause-effect relationships, and simulation studies with simplified representations of musculoskeletal geometry. In this study, we developed a novel musculoskeletal simulator that is differentiable with respect to musculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes. This simulator enabled us to find the optimal body segment dimensions and optimal distribution of added muscle volume for sprinting and marathon running. Our simulation results replicate experimental observations, such as increased muscle mass in sprinters, as well a mass in the lower end of the healthy BMI range and a higher leg-length-to-height ratio in marathon runners. The simulations also reveal new relationships, for example showing that hip musculature is vital to both sprinting and marathon running. We found hip flexor and extensor moment arms were maximized to optimize sprint and marathon running performance, and hip muscles the main target when we simulated strength training for sprinters. Our simulation results can help sprint and marathon runners customize strength training, and our simulator can be extended to other athletic tasks, such as jumping, or to non-athletic applications, such as designing interventions to improve mobility in older adults or individuals with movement disorders. AUTHOR SUMMARYOur study addresses the challenge of determining optimal musculoskeletal parameters for tasks like sprinting and marathon running. Existing research has been limited to observational studies and simplified simulations. To overcome these limitations, we developed a differentiable musculoskeletal simulator to optimize running performance. We replicated past findings and uncovered new insights. We confirmed the benefits of increased muscle mass for sprinters and identified key factors for marathon runners, such a mass in the lower end of the healthy BMI range and an increased leg-length-to-height ratio. Hip musculature was found to be critical for both sprinting and marathon running. Our simulation results have practical implications. They can inform customized strength training for sprinters and marathon runners. Additionally, the simulator can be extended to other athletic tasks, benefiting various sporting events. Beyond athletics, our open-source simulator has broader applications. It can determine minimal strength requirements for daily activities, guide strength training in the elderly, and estimate the effects of simulated musculoskeletal surgery.\nCrystal ribcage: a platform for probing real-time lung function at cellular resolution in health and disease\nAuthors: Banerji, R.; Grifno, G. N.; Shi, L.; Smolen, D.; LeBourdais, R.; Muhvich, J.; Eberman, C.; Hiller, B.; Lee, J.; Regan, K.; Zheng, S.; Zhang, S. S.; Jiang, J.; Raslan, A. A.; Breda, J. C.; Pihl, R.; Traber, K.; Mazzilli, S.; Ligresti, G.; Mizgerd, J. P.; Suki, B.; Nia, H. T.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.28.514251\nUnderstanding the dynamic pathogenesis and treatment response in pulmonary diseases requires probing the lung at cellular resolution in real-time. Despite recent progress in intravital imaging, optical imaging of the lung during active respiration and circulation has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the crystal ribcage: a transparent ribcage that (i) allows truly multiscale optical imaging of the lung in health and disease from whole-organ to single cell, (ii) enables the modulation of lung biophysics and immunity through intravascular, intrapulmonary, intraparenchymal, and optogenetic interventions, and (iii) preserves the 3-D architecture, air-liquid interface, cellular diversity, and respiratory-circulatory functions of the lung. Utilizing these unprecedented capabilities on murine models of primary and metastatic lung tumors, respiratory infection, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and acute lung injury we probed how disease progression remodels the respiratory-circulatory functions at the single alveolus and capillary levels. In cancer, we identified the earliest stage of tumorigenesis that compromises alveolar and capillary functions, a key state with consequences on tumor progression and treatment response. In pneumonia, we mapped mutual links between the recruited immune cells and the alveolar-capillary functions. We found that neutrophil migration is strongly and reversibly responsive to vascular pressure with implications for understanding of how lung physiology, altered by disease and anatomical location, affects immune cell activities. The crystal ribcage and its broad applications presented here will facilitate further studies of real-time remodeling of the alveoli and capillaries during pathogenesis of nearly any pulmonary disease, leading to the identification of new targets for treatment strategies.\nSonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites\nAuthors: Agrawal, P.; Zhuang, S.; Dreher, S.; Mitter, S.; Ahmed, D.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552292\nAdvancements in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed various fields in aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics, enabling fine-tuning material properties by reinforcing internal particles and adjusting their type, orientation, and volume fraction. This capability opens new possibilities for tailoring materials to specific applications and optimizing the performance of 3D-printed objects. Existing reinforcement strategies are restricted to pattern types, alignment areas, and particle characteristics. Alternatively, acoustics provide versatility by controlling particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge and can create intricate pattern formations. Despite the potential of acoustics in most 3D printing, limitation arises from the scattering of the acoustic field between the polymerized hard layers and the unpolymerized resin, leading to undesirable patterning formation. However, this challenge can be addressed by adopting a novel approach that involves simultaneous reinforcement and printing the entire structure. Here, we present SonoPrint, an acoustically-assisted volumetric 3D printer that produces mechanically tunable composite geometries by patterning reinforcement microparticles within the fabricated structure. SonoPrint creates a standing wave field that produces a targeted particle motif in the photosensitive resin while simultaneously printing the object in just a few minutes. We have also demonstrated various patterning configurations such as lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, quadrilaterals, and hexagons using microscopic particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene particles. Furthermore, we fabricated diverse composites using different resins, achieving 87 microns feature size. We have shown that the printed structure with patterned microparticles increased their tensile and compression strength by [~]38% and [~]75%, respectively.\nSecond Harmonic Generation Imaging Reveals Entanglement of Collagen Fibers in the Elephant Trunk Skin Dermis\nAuthors: Schulz, A.; Plotczyk, M.; Sordilla, S.; Boyle, M.; Singal, K.; Reidenberg, J.; Hu, D.; Higgins, C.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553031\nForm-function relationships often have tradeoffs: if a material is tough, it is often inflexible, and vice versa. This is particularly relevant for the elephant trunk, where the skin should be protective yet elastic. To investigate how this is achieved, we used classical histochemical staining and second harmonic generation microscopy to describe the morphology and composition of elephant trunk skin. We report structure at the macro and micro scales, from the thickness of the dermis to the interaction of 10 {micro}m thick collagen fibers. We analyzed several sites along the length of the trunk, to compare and contrast the dorsal-ventral and proximal-distal skin morphologies and compositions. We find the dorsal skin of the elephant trunk can have keratin armor layers over 2mm thick, which is nearly 100 times the thickness of the equivalent layer in human skin. We also found that the structural support layer (the dermis) of elephant trunk contains a distribution of collagen-I (COL1) fibers in both perpendicular and parallel arrangement. The bimodal distribution of collagen is seen across all portions of the trunk, and is dissimilar from that of human skin where one orientation dominates within a body site. We hypothesize that this distribution of COL1 in the elephant trunk allows both flexibility and load-bearing capabilities. Additionally, when viewing individual fiber interaction of 10 {micro}m thick collagen, we find the fiber crossings per unit volume are five times more common than in human skin, suggesting that the fibers are entangled. We surmise that these intriguing structures permit both flexibility and strength in the elephant trunk. The complex nature of the elephant skin may inspire the design of materials that can combine strength and flexibility.\nStiffness anisotropy coordinates supracellular contractility driving long-range myotube-ECM alignment\nAuthors: Skillin, N. P.; Kirkpatrick, B. E.; Herbert, K. M.; Nelson, B. R.; Hach, G. K.; Gunay, K. A.; Khan, R. M.; DelRio, F. W.; White, T. J.; Anseth, K. S.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552197\nIn skeletal muscle tissue, injury-related changes in stiffness activate muscle stem cells through mechanosensitive signaling pathways. Functional muscle tissue regeneration also requires the effective coordination of myoblast proliferation, migration, polarization, differentiation, and fusion across multiple length scales. Here, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness anisotropy coordinates contractility-driven collective cellular dynamics resulting in C2C12 myotube alignment over millimeter-scale distances. When cultured on mechanically anisotropic liquid crystalline polymer networks (LCNs) lacking topographic features that could confer contact guidance, C2C12 myoblasts collectively polarize in the stiffest direction of the substrate. Cellular coordination is amplified through reciprocal cell-ECM dynamics that emerge during fusion, driving global myotube-ECM ordering. Conversely, myotube alignment was restricted to small local domains with no directional preference on mechanically isotropic LCNs of same chemical formulation. These findings reveal a role for stiffness anisotropy in coordinating emergent collective cellular dynamics, with implications for understanding skeletal muscle tissue development and regeneration.\nSingle-cell precision nanotechnology in vivo\nAuthors: MOLBAY, M.; Kick, B.; Zhao, S.; Todorov, M.

However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

Despite a significant progress in development of mature heart-on-a-chip models of fibrosis and cardiomyopathies starting from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), human cell-based models of myocardial inflammation are lacking. Here, we bioengineered a vascularized heart-on-a-chip system with circulating immune cells to model SARS-CoV-2-induced acute myocarditis. Briefly, we observed hallmarks of COVID-19-induced myocardial inflammation in the heart-on-a-chip model, as the presence of immune cells augmented the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, triggered progressive impairment of contractile function and altered intracellular calcium transient activities. An elevation of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) was measured first in the in vitro heart-on-a-chip model and then validated in COVID-19 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), demonstrating that mitochondrial damage is an important pathophysiological hallmark of inflammation induced cardiac dysfunction. Leveraging this platform in the context of SARS-CoV-2 induced myocardial inflammation, we established that administration of human umbilical vein-derived EVs effectively rescued the contractile deficit, normalized intracellular calcium handling, elevated the contraction force and reduced the ccf- mtDNA and chemokine release via TLR-NF-kB signaling axis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cancer cells require high levels of iron for rapid proliferation, leading to a significant upregulation of the iron carrier protein Transferrin Receptor (TfR) on their cell surface. Leveraging this phenomenon and the exceptionally fast endocytosis rate of TfR, we introduce Transferrin Receptor TArgeting Chimeras (TransTAC), a novel molecular archetype for membrane protein degradation in cancers and other cell types. TransTACs repurpose the naturally recycling receptor TfR1 for protein degradation. To accomplish this, we utilized a combination of protein engineering strategies to redirect the target protein from recycling-endosome trafficking to lysosomal degradation. We show that TransTACs can highly efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native, or synthetic membrane proteins, establishing new possibilities for targeted cancer therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lymphatic, nervous, and tumoral tissues, among others, exhibit physiology that emerges from three-dimensional interactions between genetically unique cells. A technology capable of volumetrically imaging transcriptomes, genotypes, and morphologies in a single de novo measurement would therefore provide a critical view into the biological complexity of living systems. Here we achieve this by extending DNA microscopy, an imaging modality that encodes a spatio-genetic map of a specimen via a massive distributed network of DNA molecules inside it, to three dimensions and multiple length scales in developing zebrafish embryos.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computation or deep learning-based functional protein generation methods address the urgent demand for novel biocatalysts, allowing for precise tailoring of functionalities to meet specific requirements. This emergence leads to the creation of highly efficient and specialized proteins with wide-ranging applications in scientific, technological, and biomedical domains. This study establishes a conditional protein diffusion model, namely CPDiffusion, to deliver diverse protein sequences with desired functions. While the model is free from extensive training data and the sampling process involves little guidance on the type of generated amino acids, CPDiffusion effectively secures essential highly conserved residues that are crucial for protein functionalities. We employed CPDiffusion and generated 27 artificially designed Argonaute proteins, programmable endonucleases applied for easy-to-implement and high-throughput screenings in gene editing and molecular diagnostics, that mutated approximately 200-400 amino acids with 40% sequence identities to those from nature. Experimental tests demonstrate the solubility of all 27 artificially-designed proteins (AP), with 24 of them displaying DNA cleavage activity. Remarkably, 74% of active APs exhibited superior activity compared to the template protein, and the most effective one showcased a remarkable nearly nine-fold enhancement of enzymatic activity. Moreover, 37% of APs exhibited enhanced thermostability. These findings emphasize CPDiffusion&#39;s remarkable capability to generate long-sequence proteins in a single step while retaining or enhancing intricate functionality. This approach facilitates the design of intricate enzymes featuring multi-domain molecular structures through in silico generation and throughput, all accomplished without the need for supervision from labeled data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Musculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes vary widely in the population and are intricately linked to the performance of tasks ranging from walking and running to jumping and sprinting. However, our ability to understand how these parameters affect task performance has been limited due to the high computational cost of modelling the necessary complexity of the musculoskeletal system and solving the requisite multi-dimensional optimization problem. For example, sprinting and running are fundamental to many forms of sport, but past research on the relationships between musculoskeletal geometry, muscle volumes, and running performance has been limited to observational studies, which have not established cause-effect relationships, and simulation studies with simplified representations of musculoskeletal geometry. In this study, we developed a novel musculoskeletal simulator that is differentiable with respect to musculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes. This simulator enabled us to find the optimal body segment dimensions and optimal distribution of added muscle volume for sprinting and marathon running. Our simulation results replicate experimental observations, such as increased muscle mass in sprinters, as well a mass in the lower end of the healthy BMI range and a higher leg-length-to-height ratio in marathon runners. The simulations also reveal new relationships, for example showing that hip musculature is vital to both sprinting and marathon running. We found hip flexor and extensor moment arms were maximized to optimize sprint and marathon running performance, and hip muscles the main target when we simulated strength training for sprinters. Our simulation results can help sprint and marathon runners customize strength training, and our simulator can be extended to other athletic tasks, such as jumping, or to non-athletic applications, such as designing interventions to improve mobility in older adults or individuals with movement disorders.

AUTHOR SUMMARYOur study addresses the challenge of determining optimal musculoskeletal parameters for tasks like sprinting and marathon running. Existing research has been limited to observational studies and simplified simulations. To overcome these limitations, we developed a differentiable musculoskeletal simulator to optimize running performance. We replicated past findings and uncovered new insights. We confirmed the benefits of increased muscle mass for sprinters and identified key factors for marathon runners, such a mass in the lower end of the healthy BMI range and an increased leg-length-to-height ratio. Hip musculature was found to be critical for both sprinting and marathon running.

Our simulation results have practical implications. They can inform customized strength training for sprinters and marathon runners. Additionally, the simulator can be extended to other athletic tasks, benefiting various sporting events. Beyond athletics, our open-source simulator has broader applications. It can determine minimal strength requirements for daily activities, guide strength training in the elderly, and estimate the effects of simulated musculoskeletal surgery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the dynamic pathogenesis and treatment response in pulmonary diseases requires probing the lung at cellular resolution in real-time. Despite recent progress in intravital imaging, optical imaging of the lung during active respiration and circulation has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the crystal ribcage: a transparent ribcage that (i) allows truly multiscale optical imaging of the lung in health and disease from whole-organ to single cell, (ii) enables the modulation of lung biophysics and immunity through intravascular, intrapulmonary, intraparenchymal, and optogenetic interventions, and (iii) preserves the 3-D architecture, air-liquid interface, cellular diversity, and respiratory-circulatory functions of the lung. Utilizing these unprecedented capabilities on murine models of primary and metastatic lung tumors, respiratory infection, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and acute lung injury we probed how disease progression remodels the respiratory-circulatory functions at the single alveolus and capillary levels. In cancer, we identified the earliest stage of tumorigenesis that compromises alveolar and capillary functions, a key state with consequences on tumor progression and treatment response. In pneumonia, we mapped mutual links between the recruited immune cells and the alveolar-capillary functions. We found that neutrophil migration is strongly and reversibly responsive to vascular pressure with implications for understanding of how lung physiology, altered by disease and anatomical location, affects immune cell activities. The crystal ribcage and its broad applications presented here will facilitate further studies of real-time remodeling of the alveoli and capillaries during pathogenesis of nearly any pulmonary disease, leading to the identification of new targets for treatment strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advancements in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed various fields in aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics, enabling fine-tuning material properties by reinforcing internal particles and adjusting their type, orientation, and volume fraction. This capability opens new possibilities for tailoring materials to specific applications and optimizing the performance of 3D-printed objects. Existing reinforcement strategies are restricted to pattern types, alignment areas, and particle characteristics. Alternatively, acoustics provide versatility by controlling particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge and can create intricate pattern formations. Despite the potential of acoustics in most 3D printing, limitation arises from the scattering of the acoustic field between the polymerized hard layers and the unpolymerized resin, leading to undesirable patterning formation. However, this challenge can be addressed by adopting a novel approach that involves simultaneous reinforcement and printing the entire structure. Here, we present SonoPrint, an acoustically-assisted volumetric 3D printer that produces mechanically tunable composite geometries by patterning reinforcement microparticles within the fabricated structure. SonoPrint creates a standing wave field that produces a targeted particle motif in the photosensitive resin while simultaneously printing the object in just a few minutes. We have also demonstrated various patterning configurations such as lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, quadrilaterals, and hexagons using microscopic particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene particles. Furthermore, we fabricated diverse composites using different resins, achieving 87 microns feature size. We have shown that the printed structure with patterned microparticles increased their tensile and compression strength by [~]38% and [~]75%, respectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Form-function relationships often have tradeoffs: if a material is tough, it is often inflexible, and vice versa. This is particularly relevant for the elephant trunk, where the skin should be protective yet elastic. To investigate how this is achieved, we used classical histochemical staining and second harmonic generation microscopy to describe the morphology and composition of elephant trunk skin. We report structure at the macro and micro scales, from the thickness of the dermis to the interaction of 10 {micro}m thick collagen fibers. We analyzed several sites along the length of the trunk, to compare and contrast the dorsal-ventral and proximal-distal skin morphologies and compositions. We find the dorsal skin of the elephant trunk can have keratin armor layers over 2mm thick, which is nearly 100 times the thickness of the equivalent layer in human skin. We also found that the structural support layer (the dermis) of elephant trunk contains a distribution of collagen-I (COL1) fibers in both perpendicular and parallel arrangement. The bimodal distribution of collagen is seen across all portions of the trunk, and is dissimilar from that of human skin where one orientation dominates within a body site. We hypothesize that this distribution of COL1 in the elephant trunk allows both flexibility and load-bearing capabilities. Additionally, when viewing individual fiber interaction of 10 {micro}m thick collagen, we find the fiber crossings per unit volume are five times more common than in human skin, suggesting that the fibers are entangled. We surmise that these intriguing structures permit both flexibility and strength in the elephant trunk. The complex nature of the elephant skin may inspire the design of materials that can combine strength and flexibility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In skeletal muscle tissue, injury-related changes in stiffness activate muscle stem cells through mechanosensitive signaling pathways. Functional muscle tissue regeneration also requires the effective coordination of myoblast proliferation, migration, polarization, differentiation, and fusion across multiple length scales. Here, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness anisotropy coordinates contractility-driven collective cellular dynamics resulting in C2C12 myotube alignment over millimeter-scale distances. When cultured on mechanically anisotropic liquid crystalline polymer networks (LCNs) lacking topographic features that could confer contact guidance, C2C12 myoblasts collectively polarize in the stiffest direction of the substrate. Cellular coordination is amplified through reciprocal cell-ECM dynamics that emerge during fusion, driving global myotube-ECM ordering. Conversely, myotube alignment was restricted to small local domains with no directional preference on mechanically isotropic LCNs of same chemical formulation. These findings reveal a role for stiffness anisotropy in coordinating emergent collective cellular dynamics, with implications for understanding skeletal muscle tissue development and regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting nanoparticle therapeutics with cellular accuracy in whole organisms could open breakthrough opportunities in precision medicine. However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular disease continues to take more human lives than all cancer combined, prompting the need for improved research models and treatment options. Despite a significant progress in development of mature heart-on-a-chip models of fibrosis and cardiomyopathies starting from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), human cell-based models of myocardial inflammation are lacking. Here, we bioengineered a vascularized heart-on-a-chip system with circulating immune cells to model SARS-CoV-2-induced acute myocarditis. Briefly, we observed hallmarks of COVID-19-induced myocardial inflammation in the heart-on-a-chip model, as the presence of immune cells augmented the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, triggered progressive impairment of contractile function and altered intracellular calcium transient activities. An elevation of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) was measured first in the in vitro heart-on-a-chip model and then validated in COVID-19 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), demonstrating that mitochondrial damage is an important pathophysiological hallmark of inflammation induced cardiac dysfunction. Leveraging this platform in the context of SARS-CoV-2 induced myocardial inflammation, we established that administration of human umbilical vein-derived EVs effectively rescued the contractile deficit, normalized intracellular calcium handling, elevated the contraction force and reduced the ccf- mtDNA and chemokine release via TLR-NF-kB signaling axis.</p>
