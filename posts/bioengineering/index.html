Z.; Zhou, X.; Saouaf, O.; Yan, J.; Klich, J.; Jons, C. K.; Meany, E.; Valdez, A. S.; Carter, L.; Pulendran, B.; King, N. P.; Appel, E.\nScore: 147.8, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549249\nOver the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.\nLogic-based modeling of biological networks with Netflux\nAuthors: Clark, A. P.; Chowkwale, M.; Paap, A.; Dang, S.; Saucerman, J. J.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575227\nMolecular signaling networks drive a diverse range of cellular decisions, including whether to proliferate, how and when to die, and many processes in between. Such networks often connect hundreds of proteins, genes, and processes. Understanding these complex networks is greatly aided by computational modeling, but these tools require extensive programming knowledge. In this article, we describe a user-friendly, programming-free network simulation tool called Netflux (https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux). Over the last decade, Netflux has been used to construct numerous predictive network models that have deepened our understanding of how complex biological networks make cell decisions. Here, we provide a Netflux tutorial that covers how to construct a network model and then simulate network responses to perturbations. Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be able to construct your own model in Netflux and simulate how perturbations to proteins and genes propagate through signaling and gene-regulatory networks.\nUltrasound-Driven Programmable Artificial Muscles\nAuthors: Shi, Z.; Zhang, Z.; Ahmed, D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574699\nDespite their promise for technological and medical innovations, the advancement of artificial muscles faces challenges in dynamic programmability, wireless control, scalability, and responsiveness. Ultrasound offers a promising yet underutilized solution, providing effective and robust actuation. We introduce an innovative design paradigm for soft artificial muscles, utilizing tens of thousands of resonant microbubbles for targeted activation, enabling a wide range of programmable motions. We developed a comprehensive theoretical model and conducted various applications: from actuating soft grippers and powering centimeter-scale biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion to demonstrating the multimodal shape transformation of a functional surface and equipping static objects with transformative robotic skins for mobility. Our approach is marked by its compactness, high force intensity, rapid responsiveness, and lightweightness. The customizable, scalable design of our artificial muscles offers both immediate and long-term impact on robotics, wearable technology, haptics, prosthetic development, and the development of avant-garde biomedical devices like soft surgical tools. One-Sentence SummaryWe introduced a first-of-its-kind, programmable artificial muscle using ultrasound-activated microbubbles, providing a compact, responsive, and scalable solution.\nSimple visualization of submicroscopic protein clusters with a phase-separation-based fluorescent reporter.\nAuthors: Mumford, T. R.; Rae, D.; Brackhahn, E.; Idris, A.; Gonzalez-Martinez, D.; Pal, A. A.; Chung, M. C.; Guan, J.; Rhoades, E.; Bugaj, L. J.\nScore: 50.6, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.13.499962\nProtein clustering plays numerous roles in cell physiology and disease. However, protein oligomers can be difficult to detect because they are often too small to appear as puncta in conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a fluorescent reporter strategy that detects protein clusters with high sensitivity, called CluMPS (Clusters Magnified by Phase Separation). A CluMPS reporter detects and visually amplifies even small clusters of a binding partner, generating large, quantifiable fluorescence condensates. We use computational modeling and optogenetic clustering to demonstrate that CluMPS can detect small oligomers and behaves rationally according to key system parameters. CluMPS detected small aggregates of pathological proteins where the corresponding GFP fusions appeared diffuse. CluMPS also detected and tracked clusters of unmodified and tagged endogenous proteins, and orthogonal CluMPS probes could be multiplexed in cells. CluMPS provides a powerful yet straightforward approach to observe higher-order protein assembly in its native cellular context.\nSwitching to external flows: perturbations of developing vasculature within chicken chorioallantoic membrane\nAuthors: Padmanaban, P.; van Galen, D.; Salehi-Nik, N.; Zakharova, M.; Segerink, L.; Rouwkema, J.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575208\nThe impact of fluid flow shear stresses, generated by the movement of blood through vasculature, on the organization and maturation of vessels is widely recognized. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether external fluid flows outside of the vasculature in the surrounding tissue can similarly play a role in governing these processes. In this research, we introduce an innovative technique called superfusion-induced vascular steering (SIVS). SIVS involves the controlled imposition of external fluid flow patterns onto the vascularized chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), allowing us to observe how this impacts the organization of vascular networks. To investigate the concept of SIVS, we conducted superfusion experiments on the intact chick CAM cultured within engineered eggshell system, using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To capture and analyze the effects of superfusion, we employed a custom-built microscopy setup, enabling us to image both superfused and non-superfused regions within the developing CAM. This study provides valuable insights into the practical application of fluid superfusion within an in vivo context, shedding light on its significance for understanding tissue development and manipulation in an engineering setting.\nSafety and efficacy study of CRISPR/Cas9 treatment of sickle cell disease in clinically relevant conditions highlights disease-specific response\nAuthors: Frati, G.; Brusson, M.; Sartre, G.; MLAYAH, B.; FELIX, T.; Chalumeau, A.; Antoniou, P.; Hardouin, G.; Concordet, J.-P.; Romano, O.; Turchiano, G.; Miccio, A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575586\nReactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated disruption of regulatory elements involved in {gamma}-globin gene repression is a promising gene therapy strategy for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, preclinical studies aimed at optimizing the genome editing process and evaluating the safety of the editing strategy are necessary to translate this approach to the clinics. This is particularly relevant in the context of SCD, a disease characterized by inflammation, which can affect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the target cell population in gene therapy approaches for hematopoietic disorders. Here, we describe a genome editing strategy leading to therapeutically relevant reactivation of HbF expression by targeting the binding sites (BSs) for the leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF) transcriptional repressor in the HBG1 and HBG2 {gamma}-globin promoters. Electroporation of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the HBG promoters in healthy donor (HD) and patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a high frequency of LRF BS disruption and potent HbF synthesis in their erythroid progeny differentiated in vitro and ex vivo after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. LRF BS disruption did not impair SCD and HD HSPC engraftment and differentiation, but was more efficient in SCD than in HD cells. However, SCD HSPCs showed a reduced engraftment and a myeloid bias compared to HD cells. Importantly, in primary HSPCs, we detected off-target activity and the intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements between on- and off-target sites, which were more pronounced in SCD samples (likely because of the higher overall editing efficiency), but did not impact the target gene expression. Off-target activity was observed in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that it does not impair engraftment and differentiation of both SCD and HD HSPCs. Finally, transcriptomic analyses showed that the genome editing procedure results in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and inflammatory responses in both HD and SCD samples, although gene dysregulation was more evident in SCD HSPCs. Overall, this study provides evidences of feasibility, efficacy and safety for a genome editing strategy based on HbF reactivation and highlights the need of performing safety studies, when possible, in clinically relevant conditions, i.e., in patient-derived HSPCs.\nEffect of molecular weight of tyramine-modified hyaluronan on polarization state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages\nAuthors: Wychowaniec, J. K.; Bektas, E. I.; Vernengo, A. J.; Mürner, M.; Airoldi, M.; Eglin, D.; D'Este, M.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575241\nThe immunomodulatory properties of hyaluronan and its derivatives are key to their use in medicine and tissue engineering. In this work we evaluated the capability of soluble tyramine-modified hyaluronan (THA) of two molecular weights (low Mw=280 kDa and high MMw=1640 kDa) for polarization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages. We demonstrate the polarization effects of the supplemented THA by the semi-automated image analysis from confocal microscopy, immunofluorescent staining utilising CD68 and CD206 surface markers, RT-qPCR gene expression analysis, as well as using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of certain cytokines including TNF- (pro-inflammatory), IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and surface marker CD206 are more viable options for rapid screening of polarization states of macrophages with CD206 marker being associated with the lowest donor variability. Our findings indicate that low Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-inflammatory state, M1-like state, whereas high Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-regenerative, M2-like state, and that the extent of these responses are donor-dependent. The variation in the obtained phenotypic responses may stem from possible uncontrolled genetic factors in received blood donor samples. Finally, we confirm the typical association of low versus high molecular weight for THA holds true and stipulate that these responses will provide more accurate in vivo representation and translational immunomodulatory guidance for the use of THA-based biomaterials to a wider biomaterials and tissue engineering communities.\nTargeted LNPs deliver mRNA encoding IL-15 superagonists to balance efficacy and toxicity in cancer therapy\nAuthors: Yu, J.; Li, Q.; Luo, S.; Wang, X.; Cheng, Q.; Hu, R.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575299\nInterleukin-15 (IL-15) emerges as a promising immunotherapeutic candidate in oncology because of its pivotal role in modulating both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the therapeutic utility remains concern due to the unexpected toxicity. We propose here that the mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) system can balance the issue through targeted delivery to increase IL-15 concentration in the tumor area and reduce leakage into the circulation. Utilizing the Structure-driven TARgeting (STAR) platform, we acquired intellectual property LNP vectors for effective and selective mRNA delivery to local (LNPLocal) and to pulmonary (LNPLung). Then the promising IL-15 superagonists mRNAs were obtained through structural optimization and sequence screening, showing better activity compared with benchmarker N-803. Subsequently, the anti-tumor efficacy of IL-15 superagonists mRNAs were evaluated by intratumoural (i.t.) injection and intravenous (i.v.) injection via LNPLocal and LNPLung, respectively. As a result, such superagonists exhibited better anti-tumor activity, less systematic exposure, and less cytokine related risks than N-803. We finally verified the selective delivery and well tolerability of LNPLung in non-human primates (NHPs), confirming the potential for clinical application. This finding may open up new possibilities for the treatment of lung cancers and lung metastasis cancers.\nSpatial transcriptomic analysis drives PET imaging of tight junction protein expression in pancreatic cancer theranostics\nAuthors: Wang, J.; Seo, J. W.; Kare, A. J.; Schneider, M.; Tumbale, S. K.; Wu, B.; Raie, M. N.; Pandrala, M.; Iagaru, A.; Brunsing, R. L.; Charville, G. W.; Park, W. G.; Ferrara, K. W.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574209\nWe apply spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to select pancreatic cancer surface receptor targets for molecular imaging and theranostics using an approach that can be applied to many cancers. Selected cancer surfaceome epithelial markers were spatially correlated and provided specific cancer localization, whereas the spatial correlation between cancer markers and immune- cell or fibroblast markers was low. While molecular imaging of cancer-associated fibroblasts and integrins has been proposed for pancreatic cancer, our data point to the tight junction protein claudin-4 as a theranostic target. Claudin-4 expression increased [~]16 fold in cancer as compared with normal pancreas, and the tight junction localization conferred low background for imaging in normal tissue. We developed a peptide-based molecular imaging agent targeted to claudin-4 with accumulation to [~]25% injected activity per cc (IA/cc) in metastases and [~]18% IA/cc in tumors. Our work motivates a new approach for data-driven selection of molecular targets.\nDesigner micro/nano-crumpled MXene multilayer coatings accelerate osteogenesis and regulate macrophage polarization\nAuthors: Asadi Tokmedash, M.; Min, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574996\nEffective tissue regeneration and immune responses are essential for the success of biomaterial implantation. Although the interaction between synthetic materials and biological systems is well-recognized, the role of surface topographical cues in regulating the local osteoimmune microenvironment--specifically, their impact on host tissue and immune cells and their dynamic interactions--remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of surface topography on osteogenesis and immunomodulation. We fabricated MXene/Hydroxyapatite (HAP)-coated surfaces with controlled 2.5D nano-, submicro-, and micro-scale topographical patterns using our custom bottom-up pattering method. These engineered surfaces were employed to assess the behavior of osteoblast precursor cells and macrophage polarization. Our results demonstrate that MXene/HAP-coated surfaces with microscale crumpled topography significantly influence osteogenic activity and macrophage polarization: These surfaces notably enhanced osteoblast precursor cell spreading, proliferation, differentiation, and facilitated a shift in macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory, pro-healing M2 phenotype. The observed cell responses indicate that the physical cues from the crumpled topographies, combined with the chemical cues from the MXene/HAP coatings, synergistically create a favorable osteoimmune microenvironment. This study presents the first evidence of employing MXene/HAP-multilayer coated surfaces with finely crumpled topography to concurrently facilitate osteogenesis and immunomodulation for improved implant-to-tissue integration. The tunable topographic patterns of these coatings, coupled with a facile and scalable fabrication process, make them widely applicable for various biomedical purposes. Our results highlight the potential of these novel coatings to improve the in vivo performance and fate of implants by modulating the host response at the material interface.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Over the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular signaling networks drive a diverse range of cellular decisions, including whether to proliferate, how and when to die, and many processes in between. Such networks often connect hundreds of proteins, genes, and processes. Understanding these complex networks is greatly aided by computational modeling, but these tools require extensive programming knowledge. In this article, we describe a user-friendly, programming-free network simulation tool called Netflux (https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux). Over the last decade, Netflux has been used to construct numerous predictive network models that have deepened our understanding of how complex biological networks make cell decisions. Here, we provide a Netflux tutorial that covers how to construct a network model and then simulate network responses to perturbations. Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be able to construct your own model in Netflux and simulate how perturbations to proteins and genes propagate through signaling and gene-regulatory networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite their promise for technological and medical innovations, the advancement of artificial muscles faces challenges in dynamic programmability, wireless control, scalability, and responsiveness. Ultrasound offers a promising yet underutilized solution, providing effective and robust actuation. We introduce an innovative design paradigm for soft artificial muscles, utilizing tens of thousands of resonant microbubbles for targeted activation, enabling a wide range of programmable motions. We developed a comprehensive theoretical model and conducted various applications: from actuating soft grippers and powering centimeter-scale biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion to demonstrating the multimodal shape transformation of a functional surface and equipping static objects with transformative robotic skins for mobility. Our approach is marked by its compactness, high force intensity, rapid responsiveness, and lightweightness. The customizable, scalable design of our artificial muscles offers both immediate and long-term impact on robotics, wearable technology, haptics, prosthetic development, and the development of avant-garde biomedical devices like soft surgical tools.

        <p class="abstract">Protein clustering plays numerous roles in cell physiology and disease. However, protein oligomers can be difficult to detect because they are often too small to appear as puncta in conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a fluorescent reporter strategy that detects protein clusters with high sensitivity, called CluMPS (Clusters Magnified by Phase Separation). A CluMPS reporter detects and visually amplifies even small clusters of a binding partner, generating large, quantifiable fluorescence condensates. We use computational modeling and optogenetic clustering to demonstrate that CluMPS can detect small oligomers and behaves rationally according to key system parameters. CluMPS detected small aggregates of pathological proteins where the corresponding GFP fusions appeared diffuse. CluMPS also detected and tracked clusters of unmodified and tagged endogenous proteins, and orthogonal CluMPS probes could be multiplexed in cells. CluMPS provides a powerful yet straightforward approach to observe higher-order protein assembly in its native cellular context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of fluid flow shear stresses, generated by the movement of blood through vasculature, on the organization and maturation of vessels is widely recognized. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether external fluid flows outside of the vasculature in the surrounding tissue can similarly play a role in governing these processes. In this research, we introduce an innovative technique called superfusion-induced vascular steering (SIVS). SIVS involves the controlled imposition of external fluid flow patterns onto the vascularized chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), allowing us to observe how this impacts the organization of vascular networks. To investigate the concept of SIVS, we conducted superfusion experiments on the intact chick CAM cultured within engineered eggshell system, using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To capture and analyze the effects of superfusion, we employed a custom-built microscopy setup, enabling us to image both superfused and non-superfused regions within the developing CAM. This study provides valuable insights into the practical application of fluid superfusion within an in vivo context, shedding light on its significance for understanding tissue development and manipulation in an engineering setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated disruption of regulatory elements involved in {gamma}-globin gene repression is a promising gene therapy strategy for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, preclinical studies aimed at optimizing the genome editing process and evaluating the safety of the editing strategy are necessary to translate this approach to the clinics. This is particularly relevant in the context of SCD, a disease characterized by inflammation, which can affect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the target cell population in gene therapy approaches for hematopoietic disorders. Here, we describe a genome editing strategy leading to therapeutically relevant reactivation of HbF expression by targeting the binding sites (BSs) for the leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF) transcriptional repressor in the HBG1 and HBG2 {gamma}-globin promoters. Electroporation of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the HBG promoters in healthy donor (HD) and patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a high frequency of LRF BS disruption and potent HbF synthesis in their erythroid progeny differentiated in vitro and ex vivo after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. LRF BS disruption did not impair SCD and HD HSPC engraftment and differentiation, but was more efficient in SCD than in HD cells. However, SCD HSPCs showed a reduced engraftment and a myeloid bias compared to HD cells. Importantly, in primary HSPCs, we detected off-target activity and the intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements between on- and off-target sites, which were more pronounced in SCD samples (likely because of the higher overall editing efficiency), but did not impact the target gene expression. Off-target activity was observed in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that it does not impair engraftment and differentiation of both SCD and HD HSPCs. Finally, transcriptomic analyses showed that the genome editing procedure results in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and inflammatory responses in both HD and SCD samples, although gene dysregulation was more evident in SCD HSPCs. Overall, this study provides evidences of feasibility, efficacy and safety for a genome editing strategy based on HbF reactivation and highlights the need of performing safety studies, when possible, in clinically relevant conditions, i.e., in patient-derived HSPCs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immunomodulatory properties of hyaluronan and its derivatives are key to their use in medicine and tissue engineering. In this work we evaluated the capability of soluble tyramine-modified hyaluronan (THA) of two molecular weights (low Mw=280 kDa and high MMw=1640 kDa) for polarization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages. We demonstrate the polarization effects of the supplemented THA by the semi-automated image analysis from confocal microscopy, immunofluorescent staining utilising CD68 and CD206 surface markers, RT-qPCR gene expression analysis, as well as using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of certain cytokines including TNF- (pro-inflammatory), IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and surface marker CD206 are more viable options for rapid screening of polarization states of macrophages with CD206 marker being associated with the lowest donor variability. Our findings indicate that low Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-inflammatory state, M1-like state, whereas high Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-regenerative, M2-like state, and that the extent of these responses are donor-dependent. The variation in the obtained phenotypic responses may stem from possible uncontrolled genetic factors in received blood donor samples. Finally, we confirm the typical association of low versus high molecular weight for THA holds true and stipulate that these responses will provide more accurate in vivo representation and translational immunomodulatory guidance for the use of THA-based biomaterials to a wider biomaterials and tissue engineering communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interleukin-15 (IL-15) emerges as a promising immunotherapeutic candidate in oncology because of its pivotal role in modulating both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the therapeutic utility remains concern due to the unexpected toxicity. We propose here that the mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) system can balance the issue through targeted delivery to increase IL-15 concentration in the tumor area and reduce leakage into the circulation. Utilizing the Structure-driven TARgeting (STAR) platform, we acquired intellectual property LNP vectors for effective and selective mRNA delivery to local (LNPLocal) and to pulmonary (LNPLung). Then the promising IL-15 superagonists mRNAs were obtained through structural optimization and sequence screening, showing better activity compared with benchmarker N-803. Subsequently, the anti-tumor efficacy of IL-15 superagonists mRNAs were evaluated by intratumoural (i.t.) injection and intravenous (i.v.) injection via LNPLocal and LNPLung, respectively. As a result, such superagonists exhibited better anti-tumor activity, less systematic exposure, and less cytokine related risks than N-803. We finally verified the selective delivery and well tolerability of LNPLung in non-human primates (NHPs), confirming the potential for clinical application. This finding may open up new possibilities for the treatment of lung cancers and lung metastasis cancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We apply spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to select pancreatic cancer surface receptor targets for molecular imaging and theranostics using an approach that can be applied to many cancers. Selected cancer surfaceome epithelial markers were spatially correlated and provided specific cancer localization, whereas the spatial correlation between cancer markers and immune- cell or fibroblast markers was low. While molecular imaging of cancer-associated fibroblasts and integrins has been proposed for pancreatic cancer, our data point to the tight junction protein claudin-4 as a theranostic target. Claudin-4 expression increased [~]16 fold in cancer as compared with normal pancreas, and the tight junction localization conferred low background for imaging in normal tissue. We developed a peptide-based molecular imaging agent targeted to claudin-4 with accumulation to [~]25% injected activity per cc (IA/cc) in metastases and [~]18% IA/cc in tumors. Our work motivates a new approach for data-driven selection of molecular targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Effective tissue regeneration and immune responses are essential for the success of biomaterial implantation. Although the interaction between synthetic materials and biological systems is well-recognized, the role of surface topographical cues in regulating the local osteoimmune microenvironment--specifically, their impact on host tissue and immune cells and their dynamic interactions--remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of surface topography on osteogenesis and immunomodulation. We fabricated MXene/Hydroxyapatite (HAP)-coated surfaces with controlled 2.5D nano-, submicro-, and micro-scale topographical patterns using our custom bottom-up pattering method. These engineered surfaces were employed to assess the behavior of osteoblast precursor cells and macrophage polarization. Our results demonstrate that MXene/HAP-coated surfaces with microscale crumpled topography significantly influence osteogenic activity and macrophage polarization: These surfaces notably enhanced osteoblast precursor cell spreading, proliferation, differentiation, and facilitated a shift in macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory, pro-healing M2 phenotype. The observed cell responses indicate that the physical cues from the crumpled topographies, combined with the chemical cues from the MXene/HAP coatings, synergistically create a favorable osteoimmune microenvironment. This study presents the first evidence of employing MXene/HAP-multilayer coated surfaces with finely crumpled topography to concurrently facilitate osteogenesis and immunomodulation for improved implant-to-tissue integration. The tunable topographic patterns of these coatings, coupled with a facile and scalable fabrication process, make them widely applicable for various biomedical purposes. Our results highlight the potential of these novel coatings to improve the in vivo performance and fate of implants by modulating the host response at the material interface.</p>
