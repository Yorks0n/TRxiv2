However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

Traditionally, LM assumes a spatially-invariant PSF to simplify the modeling of the imaging system. However, for large fields of view (FOV) imaging, it becomes important to account for the spatially variant nature of the PSF. In this work, we propose an accurate and fast principal component analysis (PCA)-based field-dependent 3D PSF generator (PPG3D) and localizer for LM. Through simulations and experimental 3D single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), we demonstrate the effectiveness of PPG3D, enabling super-resolution imaging of mitochondria and microtubules with high fidelity over a large FOV. A comparison of PPG3D with three other shift-invariant and shift-variant PSF generators for 3D LM reveals a three-fold improvement in accuracy and an operation speed approximately one hundred times faster. Given its user-friendliness and conciseness, we believe that PPG3D holds great potential for widespread application in SMLM and other imaging modalities.\nEfficient encoding of large antigenic spaces by epitope prioritization with Dolphyn\nAuthors: Liebhoff, A.-M.; Venkataraman, T.; Morgenlander, W. R.; Na, M.; Kula, T.; Waugh, K.; Morrison, C.; Rewers, M.; Longman, R.; Round, J.; Elledge, S.; Ruczinski, I.; Langmead, B.; Larman, H. B.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551179\nWe investigated a relatively underexplored component of the gut-immune axis by profiling the antibody response to gut phages using Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). To enhance this approach, we developed Dolphyn, a novel method that uses machine learning to select peptides from protein sets and compresses the proteome through epitope-stitching. Dolphyn improves the fraction of gut phage library peptides bound by antibodies from 10% to 31% in healthy individuals, while also reducing the number of synthesized peptides by 78%. In our study on gut phages, we discovered that the immune system develops antibodies to bacteria-infecting viruses in the human gut, particularly E.coli-infecting Myoviridae. Cost-effective PhIP-Seq libraries designed with Dolphyn enable the assessment of a wider range of proteins in a single experiment, thus facilitating the study of the gut-immune axis.\nImmunometabolic cues recompose and reprogram the microenvironment around biomaterials\nAuthors: Maduka, C.

H.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551180\nCirculating monocytes infiltrate and coordinate immune responses in various inflamed tissues, such as those surrounding implanted biomaterials, affecting therapeutic, diagnostic, tissue engineering and regenerative applications. Here, we show that immunometabolic cues in the biomaterial microenvironment govern CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent trafficking of immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes; ultimately, this affects the composition and activation states of macrophage and dendritic cell populations. Furthermore, immunometabolic cues around implants orchestrate the relative composition of proinflammatory, transitory and anti-inflammatory CCR2+, CX3CR1+ and CCR2+CX3CR1+ immune cell populations. Consequently, modifying immunometabolism by glycolytic inhibition drives a pro-regenerative microenvironment in part by myeloid cells around amorphous polylactide implants. In addition to, Arginase 1-expressing myeloid cells, T helper 2 cells and {gamma}{delta}+ T-cells producing IL-4 significantly contribute to shaping the metabolically reprogramed, pro-regenerative microenvironment around crystalline polylactide biomaterials. Taken together, we find that local metabolic states regulate inflammatory processes in the biomaterial microenvironment, with implications for translational medicine.\nA gel-coated air-liquid-interface culture system with tunable substrate stiffness matching healthy and diseased lung tissues\nAuthors: He, Z.; Chu, C.; Dickson, R.; Cai, L.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.550710\nSince its invention in the late 1980s, the air-liquid-interface (ALI) culture system has been the standard in vitro model for studying human airway biology and pulmonary diseases. However, in a conventional ALI system, cells are cultured on a porous plastic membrane that is much stiffer than human airway tissues. Here, we develop a gel-ALI culture system by simply coating the plastic membrane with a thin layer of hydrogel with tunable stiffness matching that of healthy and fibrotic airway tissues. We determine the optimum gel thickness that does not impair the transport of nutrients and biomolecules essential to cell growth. We show that the gel-ALI system allows human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) to proliferate and differentiate into a pseudostratified epithelium. Further, we discover that HBECs migrate significantly faster on hydrogel substrates with stiffness matching that of fibrotic lung tissues, highlighting the importance of mechanical cues to human airway remodeling. The developed gel-ALI system provides a facile approach to studying the effects of mechanical cues on human airway biology and in modeling pulmonary diseases.

A.; Kansara, K.; Dahle, L.; Kumar, A.; Bhatia, D. D.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551657\nMetastatic breast cancer is a significant clinical challenge calling for novel and efficient therapeutic approaches. DNA tetrahedron, a highly programmable nanocage, offers some promising attributes including biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization making it an attractive candidate for drug delivery. In this study, we have explored the potential of DNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin, a DNA and RNA synthesis-inhibiting chemotherapy drug. We have encapsulated doxorubicin in DNA tetrahedron (TD: Dox) and subsequently focused on metastatic breast cancer cells for the effect of the same. We showed that TD: Dox has the potential to inhibit the migration of cancerous cells in the 2D model and inhibit the invasion of tumor cells in the 3D model as well. This system also can be uptaken in in vivo zebrafish model as well. Overall, this study promises the TD: Dox system as an ideal drug delivery model and a viable approach for metastatic breast cancer treatment.\nSaponin Nanoparticle Adjuvants Incorporating Toll-Like Receptor Agonists Improve Vaccine Immunomodulation\nAuthors: Ou, B.

P.; Appel, E.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549249\nOver the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) such as TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a, or a mixture of TLR4a and TLR7/8a adjuvants and denoted them as TLR1/2a-SNP, TLR4a-SNP, TLR7/8a-SNP, and TLR4a-TLR7/8a-SNP respectively. These TLRa-SNPs greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of this newly designed adjuvant technology to a range of different antigens. More importantly, in addition to their potency, different formulations of TLRa-SNPs induced unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could have a major impact on modern vaccine indications.\nDeep Learning-Enabled, Detection of Rare Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters in Whole Blood Using Label-free, Flow Cytometry\nAuthors: Vora, N.; Shekhar, P.; Esmail, M.; Patra, A.; Georgakoudi, I.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551485\nMetastatic tumors have poor prognoses for progression-free and overall survival for all cancer patients. Rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and rarer circulating tumor cell clusters (CTCCs) are potential biomarkers of metastatic growth, with CTCCs representing an increased risk factor for metastasis. Current detection platforms are optimized for ex vivo detection of CTCs only. Microfluidic chips and size exclusion methods have been proposed for CTCC detection; however, they lack in vivo utility and real-time monitoring capability. Confocal backscatter and fluorescence flow cytometry (BSFC) has been used for label-free detection of CTCCs in whole blood based on machine learning (ML) enabled peak classification. Here, we expand to a deep-learning (DL) -based, peak detection and classification model to detect CTCCs in whole blood data. We demonstrate that DL-based BSFC has a low false alarm rate of 0.78 events/min with a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.943 between detected events and expected events. DL-based BSFC of whole blood maintains a detection purity of 72% and a sensitivity of 35.3% for both homotypic and heterotypic CTCCs starting at a minimum size of two cells. We also demonstrate through artificial spiking studies that DL-based BSFC is sensitive to changes in the number of CTCCs present in the samples and does not add variability in detection beyond the expected variability from Poisson statistics. The performance established by DL-based BSFC motivates its use for in vivo detection of CTCCs. Further developments of label-free BSFC to enhance throughput could lead to critical applications in the clinical detection of CTCCs and ex vivo isolation of CTCC from whole blood with minimal disruption and processing steps.\nConductive microgel annealed scaffolds enhance myogenic potential of myoblastic cells\nAuthors: Casella, A.; Lowen, J.; Shimamoto, N.; Griffin, K. H.; Filler, A. C.; Panitch, A.; Leach, K.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551533\nBioelectricity is an understudied phenomenon to guide tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Conductive biomaterials may capture native or exogenous bioelectric signaling, but incorporation of conductive moieties is limited by cytotoxicity, poor injectability, or insufficient stimulation. Microgel annealed scaffolds are promising as hydrogel-based materials due to their inherent void space that facilitates cell migration and proliferation better than nanoporous bulk hydrogels. We generated conductive microgels from poly(ethylene) glycol and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) to explore the interplay of void volume and conductivity on myogenic differentiation. PEDOT:PSS increased microgel conductivity over 2-fold while maintaining stiffness, annealing strength, and viability of associated myoblastic cells. C2C12 myoblasts exhibited increases in the late-stage differentiation marker myosin heavy chain as a function of both porosity and conductivity. Myogenin, an earlier marker, was influenced only by porosity. Human skeletal muscle derived cells exhibited increased Myod1, IGF-1, and IGFBP-2 at earlier timepoints on conductive microgel scaffolds compared to non-conductive scaffolds. They also secreted higher levels of VEGF at early timepoints and expressed factors that led to macrophage polarization patterns observed during muscle repair. These data indicate that conductivity aids myogenic differentiation of myogenic cell lines and primary cells, motivating the need for future translational studies to promote muscle repair.\nGenerating an organ-deficient animal model using a multi-targeted CRISPR-Cas9 system\nAuthors: Lim, J. J.-Y.; Yuri, S.; Kawai, T.; Isotani, A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551401\nGene-knockout animal models with organ-deficient phenotypes used for blastocyst complementation are generally not viable. Animals need to be maintained as heterozygous mutants, and homozygous mutant embryos yield only one-fourth of all embryos. In this study, we generated organ-deficient embryos using the CRISPR-Cas9-sgRNAms system that induces cell death with a single-guide RNA (sgRNAms) targeting multiple sites in the genome. The Cas9-sgRNAms system interrupted cell proliferation and induced cell ablation in vitro. The mouse model had Cas9 driven by the Foxn1 promoter with a ubiquitous expression cassette of sgRNAms at the Rosa26 locus (Foxn1Cas9; Rosa26_ms). It showed an athymic phenotype similar to that of nude mice but was not hairless. Eventually, a rat cell-derived thymus in an interspecific chimera was generated by blastocyst complementation of Foxn1Cas9; Rosa26_ms mouse embryos with rat embryonic stem cells. Theoretically, half of the total embryos have the Cas9-sgRNAms system because Rosa26_ms could be maintained as homozygous.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Targeting nanoparticle therapeutics with cellular accuracy in whole organisms could open breakthrough opportunities in precision medicine. However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

        <p class="abstract">Accurate characterization of the microscopic point spread function (PSF) is crucial for achieving high-performance localization microscopy (LM). Traditionally, LM assumes a spatially-invariant PSF to simplify the modeling of the imaging system. However, for large fields of view (FOV) imaging, it becomes important to account for the spatially variant nature of the PSF. In this work, we propose an accurate and fast principal component analysis (PCA)-based field-dependent 3D PSF generator (PPG3D) and localizer for LM. Through simulations and experimental 3D single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), we demonstrate the effectiveness of PPG3D, enabling super-resolution imaging of mitochondria and microtubules with high fidelity over a large FOV. A comparison of PPG3D with three other shift-invariant and shift-variant PSF generators for 3D LM reveals a three-fold improvement in accuracy and an operation speed approximately one hundred times faster. Given its user-friendliness and conciseness, we believe that PPG3D holds great potential for widespread application in SMLM and other imaging modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We investigated a relatively underexplored component of the gut-immune axis by profiling the antibody response to gut phages using Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). To enhance this approach, we developed Dolphyn, a novel method that uses machine learning to select peptides from protein sets and compresses the proteome through epitope-stitching. Dolphyn improves the fraction of gut phage library peptides bound by antibodies from 10% to 31% in healthy individuals, while also reducing the number of synthesized peptides by 78%. In our study on gut phages, we discovered that the immune system develops antibodies to bacteria-infecting viruses in the human gut, particularly E.coli-infecting Myoviridae. Cost-effective PhIP-Seq libraries designed with Dolphyn enable the assessment of a wider range of proteins in a single experiment, thus facilitating the study of the gut-immune axis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Circulating monocytes infiltrate and coordinate immune responses in various inflamed tissues, such as those surrounding implanted biomaterials, affecting therapeutic, diagnostic, tissue engineering and regenerative applications. Here, we show that immunometabolic cues in the biomaterial microenvironment govern CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent trafficking of immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes; ultimately, this affects the composition and activation states of macrophage and dendritic cell populations. Furthermore, immunometabolic cues around implants orchestrate the relative composition of proinflammatory, transitory and anti-inflammatory CCR2&#43;, CX3CR1&#43; and CCR2&#43;CX3CR1&#43; immune cell populations. Consequently, modifying immunometabolism by glycolytic inhibition drives a pro-regenerative microenvironment in part by myeloid cells around amorphous polylactide implants. In addition to, Arginase 1-expressing myeloid cells, T helper 2 cells and {gamma}{delta}&#43; T-cells producing IL-4 significantly contribute to shaping the metabolically reprogramed, pro-regenerative microenvironment around crystalline polylactide biomaterials. Taken together, we find that local metabolic states regulate inflammatory processes in the biomaterial microenvironment, with implications for translational medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Since its invention in the late 1980s, the air-liquid-interface (ALI) culture system has been the standard in vitro model for studying human airway biology and pulmonary diseases. However, in a conventional ALI system, cells are cultured on a porous plastic membrane that is much stiffer than human airway tissues. Here, we develop a gel-ALI culture system by simply coating the plastic membrane with a thin layer of hydrogel with tunable stiffness matching that of healthy and fibrotic airway tissues. We determine the optimum gel thickness that does not impair the transport of nutrients and biomolecules essential to cell growth. We show that the gel-ALI system allows human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) to proliferate and differentiate into a pseudostratified epithelium. Further, we discover that HBECs migrate significantly faster on hydrogel substrates with stiffness matching that of fibrotic lung tissues, highlighting the importance of mechanical cues to human airway remodeling. The developed gel-ALI system provides a facile approach to studying the effects of mechanical cues on human airway biology and in modeling pulmonary diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Metastatic breast cancer is a significant clinical challenge calling for novel and efficient therapeutic approaches. DNA tetrahedron, a highly programmable nanocage, offers some promising attributes including biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization making it an attractive candidate for drug delivery. In this study, we have explored the potential of DNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin, a DNA and RNA synthesis-inhibiting chemotherapy drug. We have encapsulated doxorubicin in DNA tetrahedron (TD: Dox) and subsequently focused on metastatic breast cancer cells for the effect of the same. We showed that TD: Dox has the potential to inhibit the migration of cancerous cells in the 2D model and inhibit the invasion of tumor cells in the 3D model as well. This system also can be uptaken in in vivo zebrafish model as well. Overall, this study promises the TD: Dox system as an ideal drug delivery model and a viable approach for metastatic breast cancer treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) such as TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a, or a mixture of TLR4a and TLR7/8a adjuvants and denoted them as TLR1/2a-SNP, TLR4a-SNP, TLR7/8a-SNP, and TLR4a-TLR7/8a-SNP respectively. These TLRa-SNPs greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of this newly designed adjuvant technology to a range of different antigens. More importantly, in addition to their potency, different formulations of TLRa-SNPs induced unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could have a major impact on modern vaccine indications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metastatic tumors have poor prognoses for progression-free and overall survival for all cancer patients. Rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and rarer circulating tumor cell clusters (CTCCs) are potential biomarkers of metastatic growth, with CTCCs representing an increased risk factor for metastasis. Current detection platforms are optimized for ex vivo detection of CTCs only. Microfluidic chips and size exclusion methods have been proposed for CTCC detection; however, they lack in vivo utility and real-time monitoring capability. Confocal backscatter and fluorescence flow cytometry (BSFC) has been used for label-free detection of CTCCs in whole blood based on machine learning (ML) enabled peak classification. Here, we expand to a deep-learning (DL) -based, peak detection and classification model to detect CTCCs in whole blood data. We demonstrate that DL-based BSFC has a low false alarm rate of 0.78 events/min with a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.943 between detected events and expected events. DL-based BSFC of whole blood maintains a detection purity of 72% and a sensitivity of 35.3% for both homotypic and heterotypic CTCCs starting at a minimum size of two cells. We also demonstrate through artificial spiking studies that DL-based BSFC is sensitive to changes in the number of CTCCs present in the samples and does not add variability in detection beyond the expected variability from Poisson statistics. The performance established by DL-based BSFC motivates its use for in vivo detection of CTCCs. Further developments of label-free BSFC to enhance throughput could lead to critical applications in the clinical detection of CTCCs and ex vivo isolation of CTCC from whole blood with minimal disruption and processing steps.</p>

Conductive biomaterials may capture native or exogenous bioelectric signaling, but incorporation of conductive moieties is limited by cytotoxicity, poor injectability, or insufficient stimulation. Microgel annealed scaffolds are promising as hydrogel-based materials due to their inherent void space that facilitates cell migration and proliferation better than nanoporous bulk hydrogels. We generated conductive microgels from poly(ethylene) glycol and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) to explore the interplay of void volume and conductivity on myogenic differentiation. PEDOT:PSS increased microgel conductivity over 2-fold while maintaining stiffness, annealing strength, and viability of associated myoblastic cells. C2C12 myoblasts exhibited increases in the late-stage differentiation marker myosin heavy chain as a function of both porosity and conductivity. Myogenin, an earlier marker, was influenced only by porosity. Human skeletal muscle derived cells exhibited increased Myod1, IGF-1, and IGFBP-2 at earlier timepoints on conductive microgel scaffolds compared to non-conductive scaffolds. They also secreted higher levels of VEGF at early timepoints and expressed factors that led to macrophage polarization patterns observed during muscle repair. These data indicate that conductivity aids myogenic differentiation of myogenic cell lines and primary cells, motivating the need for future translational studies to promote muscle repair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gene-knockout animal models with organ-deficient phenotypes used for blastocyst complementation are generally not viable. Animals need to be maintained as heterozygous mutants, and homozygous mutant embryos yield only one-fourth of all embryos. In this study, we generated organ-deficient embryos using the CRISPR-Cas9-sgRNAms system that induces cell death with a single-guide RNA (sgRNAms) targeting multiple sites in the genome. The Cas9-sgRNAms system interrupted cell proliferation and induced cell ablation in vitro. The mouse model had Cas9 driven by the Foxn1 promoter with a ubiquitous expression cassette of sgRNAms at the Rosa26 locus (Foxn1Cas9; Rosa26_ms). It showed an athymic phenotype similar to that of nude mice but was not hairless. Eventually, a rat cell-derived thymus in an interspecific chimera was generated by blastocyst complementation of Foxn1Cas9; Rosa26_ms mouse embryos with rat embryonic stem cells. Theoretically, half of the total embryos have the Cas9-sgRNAms system because Rosa26_ms could be maintained as homozygous.</p>
