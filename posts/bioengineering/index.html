However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.\nCoordinated differentiation of human intestinal organoids with functional enteric neurons and vasculature\nAuthors: Childs, C.

M.; Singh, A.; Giger, R.; Mahe, M. M.; Walton, K. D.; Loebel, C.; Helmrath, M. A.; Rafii, S.; Spence, J. R.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565830\nHuman intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells co-differentiate both epithelial and mesenchymal lineages in vitro but lack important cell types such as neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle. Here, we report an in vitro method to derive HIOs with epithelium, mesenchyme, enteric neuroglial populations, endothelial cells, and organized smooth muscle in a single differentiation, without the need for co-culture. When transplanted into a murine host, these populations expand and organize to support organoid maturation and function. Functional experiments demonstrate enteric nervous system function, with HIOs undergoing peristaltic-like contractions, suggesting the development of a functional neuromuscular unit. HIOs also form functional vasculature, demonstrated in vitro using microfluidic devices to introduce vascular-like flow, and in vivo following transplantation, where HIO endothelial cells anastomose with host vasculature. Collectively, we report an in vitro model of the human gut that simultaneously co-differentiates epithelial, stromal, endothelial, neural, and organized muscle populations.\nAccelerated design of Escherichia coli genomes with reduced size using a whole-cell model and machine learning surrogate\nAuthors: Gherman, I. M.; Rees-Garbutt, J. P.; Pang, W.; Abdallah, Z. S.; Gorochowski, T. E.; Grierson, C. S.; Marucci, L.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564402\nWhole-cell models (WCMs) are multi-scale computational models that aim to accurately simulate the function of all genes and biological processes within a cell. While WCMs offer deeper insights into why cells behave and respond in specific ways, they also require significant computational resources to run, making their development and use challenging. To address this limitation it is possible to use simpler machine learning (ML) surrogates that can learn to approximate specific behaviours of larger and more complex models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. Here, we show how ML surrogates can be trained on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). We used these surrogates and a genome-design algorithm to generate a reduced E. coli cell in silico, where 39% of the genes included in the WCM were removed, a task made possible by our ML surrogate that performs simulations up to 16 times faster than the original WCM. These results demonstrate the value of adopting WCMs and ML surrogates for enabling genome-wide engineering of living cells, offering promising new routes for biologists to understand better how cellular phenotypes emerge from genotypes.\nDNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Cargo Transfer\nAuthors: Buber, E.; Yaadav, R.; Schroeder, T.; Franquelim, H. G.; Tinnefeld, P.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565475\nInteracting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.\nHigh-throughput, label-free detection of DNA origami in single-cell suspensions using origamiFISH-Flow\nAuthors: Alexander, S.; Wang, W. X.; Tseng, C.-Y.; Douglas, T. R.; Chou, L. Y. T.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564845\nStructural DNA nanotechnology enables custom fabrication of nanoscale devices and promises diverse biological applications. However, the effects of design on DNA nanostructure (DN)-cell interactions in vitro and in vivo are not yet well-characterized. origamiFISH is a recently developed technique for imaging DNs in cells and tissues. Compared to the use of fluorescent tags, origamiFISH offers label-free and structure-agnostic detection of DNs with significantly improved sensitivity. Here, we extend the origamiFISH technique to quantifying DNs in single-cell suspensions, including nonadherent cells such as subsets of immune cells, via readout by flow cytometry. This method, referred to as origamiFISH-Flow, is high-throughput (e.g., 10,000 cells per second) and compatible with immunostaining for concurrent cell-type and -state characterization. We demonstrate that origamiFISH-Flow enhances signal-to-noise ratio by up to 20-fold compared to dye labeling approaches, leading to the capture of \u003e25-fold more DN+ cells at low, single-picomolar DN uptake concentrations. We additionally show the use of origamiFISH-Flow to profile cell-type and shape-specific DN uptake patterns across cell lines and splenocytes and quantify in vivo DN accumulation in lymphoid organs. Together, origamiFISH-Flow offers a new tool to interrogate DN interactions with cells and tissues, while providing insights for tailoring their designs in bio-applications.\nA human pluripotent stem cell-based somitogenesis model using microfluidics\nAuthors: Liu, Y.; Kim, Y. S.; Xue, X.; Kobayashi, N.; Sun, S.; Yang, Q.; Pourquie, O.; Fu, J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564399\nEmerging human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based embryo models are useful for studying human embryogenesis. Particularly, there are hPSC-based somitogenesis models using free-floating culture that recapitulate somite formation. Somitogenesis in vivo involves intricately orchestrated bio-chemical and -mechanical events. However, none of the current somitogenesis models controls biochemical gradients or biomechanical signals in the culture, limiting their applicability to untangle complex biochemical-biomechanical interactions that drive somitogenesis. Here we report a new human somitogenesis model by confining hPSC-derived presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissues in microfabricated trenches. Exogenous microfluidic morphogen gradients imposed on PSM cause axial patterning and trigger spontaneous rostral-to-caudal somite formation. A mechanical theory is developed to explain the size dependency between somites and PSM. The microfluidic somitogenesis model is further exploited to reveal regulatory roles of cellular and tissue biomechanics in somite formation. This study presents a useful microengineered, hPSC-based model for understanding the bio-chemical and -mechanical events that guide somite formation.\nTRILL: Orchestrating Modular Deep-Learning Workflows for Democratized, Scalable Protein Analysis and Engineering\nAuthors: Martinez, Z. A.; Murray, R. M.; Thomson, M. W.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563881\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep-learning models have been rapidly adopted by many fields, partly due to the deluge of data humanity has amassed. In particular, the petabases of biological sequencing data enable the unsupervised training of protein language models that learn the \"language of life.\" However, due to their prohibitive size and complexity, contemporary deep-learning models are often unwieldy, especially for scientists with limited machine learning backgrounds. TRILL (TRaining and Inference using the Language of Life) is a platform for creative protein design and discovery. Leveraging several state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, DiffDock, and RFDiffusion, TRILL allows researchers to generate novel proteins, predict 3-D structures, extract high-dimensional representations of proteins, functionally classify proteins and more. What sets TRILL apart is its ability to enable complex pipelines by chaining together models and effectively merging the capabilities of different models to achieve a sum greater than its individual parts. Whether using Google Colab with one GPU or a supercomputer with hundreds, TRILL allows scientists to effectively utilize models with millions to billions of parameters by using optimized training strategies such as ZeRO-Offload and distributed data parallel. Therefore, TRILL not only bridges the gap between complex deep-learning models and their practical application in the field of biology, but also simplifies the orchestration of these models into comprehensive workflows, democratizing access to powerful methods.

The ability to remove AFs from common food and feed commodities will improve health standards and limit the economic impact inflicted by AF food contamination. Known chemical strategies have used strong acids and bases to remove contaminating AF, but these methods often lead to ecological waste issues downstream. In this study, we explore the application of weaker acidic and alkaline conditions to removes two types of AFs, AFB1 and AFG2. We find that a pH 9 buffered environment reduces AFB1 and AFG2 by more than 50% and 95%, respectively, within 24 hours. We show that AF degradation is through lactone ring opening, which is a known cause of AF toxicity, and provide a potential structure of the AFG2 degradation byproduct. Further, we confirm that incubation in the pH 9 environment reduces the genotoxicity of AFB1. Our findings indicate that a weakly alkaline environment may adequately detoxify AF-contaminated food or feed without the need to apply stronger or harsher basic conditions.\nPerpetual bioplastic production by a cyanobacteria-dominated microbiome\nAuthors: Altamira, B.; Arnau Roca, M.; Lage, A.; Gonzalez-Flo, E.; Garcia, J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565755\nDeparting from the conventional axenic and heterotrophic cultures, our research ventures into unexplored territory by investigating the potential of photosynthetic microbiomes for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. A cyanobacteria-rich microbiome was harnessed for PHB production in a 3 L photobioreactor under non-sterile conditions. The robust culture achieved up to 28 %dcw PHB over 108 days of alternating growth and accumulation phases. Nile Blue staining and Transmission Electron Microscope visualization successfully confirmed the presence of PHB granules within cyanobacteria cells. Analysis through proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance further validated the extracted polymer as PHB. In addition, the overexpression of the enzyme PHA synthase throughout the accumulation phase correlated directly with the increased PHB production. Also, gene expression changes suggested that initially, glycogen served as the primary storage compound. However, with prolonged macronutrient stress, there was a shift of the carbon flux towards favoring PHB synthesis. Overall, it was demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using a phototrophic microbiome to continuous production of PHB in a non-sterile system, contributing to advancing in the field of biopolymer production and offering valuable insights into the metabolic pathways involved.\nPlanar Amorphous Silicon Carbide Microelectrode Arrays for Chronic Recording in Rat Motor Cortex\nAuthors: Abbott, J.

G.; Pancrazio, J. J.; Cogan, S. F.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565338\nChronic implantation of intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) capable of recording from individual neurons can be used for the development of brain-machine interfaces. However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain's foreign body response. This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the foreign body response to enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the foreign body response is the use of ultrathin MEAs. Here, we fabricated ultrathin (cross-sectional area: 160 um2) amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs with sixteen electrode channels and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication techniques. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized in vitro pre-implantation and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50 mV/s and 50,000 mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30 kHz impedance values and 50,000 mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50 mV/s CV and 1 Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6 MOhms; at 30 kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50 mV/s were 58.1 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 55.9 mC/cm2 on week 16, and at 50,000 mV/s were 4.27 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 5.93 mC/cm2 on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of only -0.19 per week. We also classified the units as fast and slow spiking based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow spiking units declined at a similar rate. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed minimal foreign body response to the a-SiC devices, as highlighted by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cells between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neural cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results support the use of ultrathin a-SiC MEAs for long-term implantation and use in brain-machine interfaces.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Vascular engineering seeks to generate reliable models for studying cellular interactions in the context of preserving homeostasis and disease development. However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells co-differentiate both epithelial and mesenchymal lineages in vitro but lack important cell types such as neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle. Here, we report an in vitro method to derive HIOs with epithelium, mesenchyme, enteric neuroglial populations, endothelial cells, and organized smooth muscle in a single differentiation, without the need for co-culture. When transplanted into a murine host, these populations expand and organize to support organoid maturation and function. Functional experiments demonstrate enteric nervous system function, with HIOs undergoing peristaltic-like contractions, suggesting the development of a functional neuromuscular unit. HIOs also form functional vasculature, demonstrated in vitro using microfluidic devices to introduce vascular-like flow, and in vivo following transplantation, where HIO endothelial cells anastomose with host vasculature. Collectively, we report an in vitro model of the human gut that simultaneously co-differentiates epithelial, stromal, endothelial, neural, and organized muscle populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whole-cell models (WCMs) are multi-scale computational models that aim to accurately simulate the function of all genes and biological processes within a cell. While WCMs offer deeper insights into why cells behave and respond in specific ways, they also require significant computational resources to run, making their development and use challenging. To address this limitation it is possible to use simpler machine learning (ML) surrogates that can learn to approximate specific behaviours of larger and more complex models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. Here, we show how ML surrogates can be trained on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). We used these surrogates and a genome-design algorithm to generate a reduced E. coli cell in silico, where 39% of the genes included in the WCM were removed, a task made possible by our ML surrogate that performs simulations up to 16 times faster than the original WCM. These results demonstrate the value of adopting WCMs and ML surrogates for enabling genome-wide engineering of living cells, offering promising new routes for biologists to understand better how cellular phenotypes emerge from genotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural DNA nanotechnology enables custom fabrication of nanoscale devices and promises diverse biological applications. However, the effects of design on DNA nanostructure (DN)-cell interactions in vitro and in vivo are not yet well-characterized. origamiFISH is a recently developed technique for imaging DNs in cells and tissues. Compared to the use of fluorescent tags, origamiFISH offers label-free and structure-agnostic detection of DNs with significantly improved sensitivity. Here, we extend the origamiFISH technique to quantifying DNs in single-cell suspensions, including nonadherent cells such as subsets of immune cells, via readout by flow cytometry. This method, referred to as origamiFISH-Flow, is high-throughput (e.g., 10,000 cells per second) and compatible with immunostaining for concurrent cell-type and -state characterization. We demonstrate that origamiFISH-Flow enhances signal-to-noise ratio by up to 20-fold compared to dye labeling approaches, leading to the capture of &gt;25-fold more DN&#43; cells at low, single-picomolar DN uptake concentrations. We additionally show the use of origamiFISH-Flow to profile cell-type and shape-specific DN uptake patterns across cell lines and splenocytes and quantify in vivo DN accumulation in lymphoid organs. Together, origamiFISH-Flow offers a new tool to interrogate DN interactions with cells and tissues, while providing insights for tailoring their designs in bio-applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emerging human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based embryo models are useful for studying human embryogenesis. Particularly, there are hPSC-based somitogenesis models using free-floating culture that recapitulate somite formation. Somitogenesis in vivo involves intricately orchestrated bio-chemical and -mechanical events. However, none of the current somitogenesis models controls biochemical gradients or biomechanical signals in the culture, limiting their applicability to untangle complex biochemical-biomechanical interactions that drive somitogenesis. Here we report a new human somitogenesis model by confining hPSC-derived presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissues in microfabricated trenches. Exogenous microfluidic morphogen gradients imposed on PSM cause axial patterning and trigger spontaneous rostral-to-caudal somite formation. A mechanical theory is developed to explain the size dependency between somites and PSM. The microfluidic somitogenesis model is further exploited to reveal regulatory roles of cellular and tissue biomechanics in somite formation. This study presents a useful microengineered, hPSC-based model for understanding the bio-chemical and -mechanical events that guide somite formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep-learning models have been rapidly adopted by many fields, partly due to the deluge of data humanity has amassed. In particular, the petabases of biological sequencing data enable the unsupervised training of protein language models that learn the &#34;language of life.&#34; However, due to their prohibitive size and complexity, contemporary deep-learning models are often unwieldy, especially for scientists with limited machine learning backgrounds. TRILL (TRaining and Inference using the Language of Life) is a platform for creative protein design and discovery. Leveraging several state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, DiffDock, and RFDiffusion, TRILL allows researchers to generate novel proteins, predict 3-D structures, extract high-dimensional representations of proteins, functionally classify proteins and more. What sets TRILL apart is its ability to enable complex pipelines by chaining together models and effectively merging the capabilities of different models to achieve a sum greater than its individual parts. Whether using Google Colab with one GPU or a supercomputer with hundreds, TRILL allows scientists to effectively utilize models with millions to billions of parameters by using optimized training strategies such as ZeRO-Offload and distributed data parallel. Therefore, TRILL not only bridges the gap between complex deep-learning models and their practical application in the field of biology, but also simplifies the orchestration of these models into comprehensive workflows, democratizing access to powerful methods.

        <p class="abstract">Aflatoxins (AFs) are fungal metabolites that ubiquitously contaminate many common food crops and contribute to major foodborne diseases in humans and animals. The ability to remove AFs from common food and feed commodities will improve health standards and limit the economic impact inflicted by AF food contamination. Known chemical strategies have used strong acids and bases to remove contaminating AF, but these methods often lead to ecological waste issues downstream. In this study, we explore the application of weaker acidic and alkaline conditions to removes two types of AFs, AFB1 and AFG2. We find that a pH 9 buffered environment reduces AFB1 and AFG2 by more than 50% and 95%, respectively, within 24 hours. We show that AF degradation is through lactone ring opening, which is a known cause of AF toxicity, and provide a potential structure of the AFG2 degradation byproduct. Further, we confirm that incubation in the pH 9 environment reduces the genotoxicity of AFB1. Our findings indicate that a weakly alkaline environment may adequately detoxify AF-contaminated food or feed without the need to apply stronger or harsher basic conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Departing from the conventional axenic and heterotrophic cultures, our research ventures into unexplored territory by investigating the potential of photosynthetic microbiomes for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. A cyanobacteria-rich microbiome was harnessed for PHB production in a 3 L photobioreactor under non-sterile conditions. The robust culture achieved up to 28 %dcw PHB over 108 days of alternating growth and accumulation phases. Nile Blue staining and Transmission Electron Microscope visualization successfully confirmed the presence of PHB granules within cyanobacteria cells. Analysis through proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance further validated the extracted polymer as PHB. In addition, the overexpression of the enzyme PHA synthase throughout the accumulation phase correlated directly with the increased PHB production. Also, gene expression changes suggested that initially, glycogen served as the primary storage compound. However, with prolonged macronutrient stress, there was a shift of the carbon flux towards favoring PHB synthesis. Overall, it was demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using a phototrophic microbiome to continuous production of PHB in a non-sterile system, contributing to advancing in the field of biopolymer production and offering valuable insights into the metabolic pathways involved.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic implantation of intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) capable of recording from individual neurons can be used for the development of brain-machine interfaces. However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brain&#39;s foreign body response. This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the foreign body response to enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the foreign body response is the use of ultrathin MEAs. Here, we fabricated ultrathin (cross-sectional area: 160 um2) amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs with sixteen electrode channels and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication techniques. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized in vitro pre-implantation and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50 mV/s and 50,000 mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30 kHz impedance values and 50,000 mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50 mV/s CV and 1 Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6 MOhms; at 30 kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50 mV/s were 58.1 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 55.9 mC/cm2 on week 16, and at 50,000 mV/s were 4.27 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 5.93 mC/cm2 on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of only -0.19 per week. We also classified the units as fast and slow spiking based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow spiking units declined at a similar rate. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed minimal foreign body response to the a-SiC devices, as highlighted by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cells between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neural cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results support the use of ultrathin a-SiC MEAs for long-term implantation and use in brain-machine interfaces.</p>
