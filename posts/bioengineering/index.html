  "articleBody": " Encapsulation of AAVs into protein vault nanoparticles as a novel solution to gene therapy's neutralizing antibody problem\nAuthors: Collins, L. T.; Beatty, W.; Moyo, B.; Alves-Bezerra, M.; Hurley, A.; Lagor, W.; Bao, G.; Ponnazhagan, S.; McNally, R.; Rome, L.; Curiel, D.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569229\nAlthough adeno-associated virus (AAV) has enjoyed enormous success as a delivery modality for gene therapy, it continues to suffer from the high prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies in human populations, limiting who can receive potentially life-saving treatments. In this regard, AAV therapies generally also must be administered as a single dose since neutralizing antibodies develop in patients who receive the virus. Strategies for circumventing these issues remain limited. As a novel solution, we employed SpyTag-SpyCatcher molecular glue technology to facilitate packaging of AAVs inside of recombinant protein vault nanoparticles. Vaults are endogenous proteinaceous organelles produced by mammalian cells, so they are recognized as self by the immune system. They therefore can shield packaged molecules from neutralizing antibodies. Vault has previously been utilized to deliver drugs and proteins into cells, but our study represents the first time anyone has packaged an entire virus inside of vault. We showed that our vaultAAV (VAAV) delivery vehicle transduces cells in the presence of anti-AAV neutralizing serum. VAAV is positioned as a new gene therapy delivery platform with potential to overcome the neutralizing antibody problem and perhaps even allow administration of multiple doses, expanding the scope of AAV treatments.\nCellular Senescence Impairs Tendon Extracellular Matrix Remodeling in Response to Mechanical Unloading\nAuthors: Stowe, E. J.; Keller, M. R.; Connizzo, B. K.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572594\nMusculoskeletal injuries, including tendinopathies, present a significant clinical burden for aging populations. While the biological drivers of age-related declines in tendon function are poorly understood, it is well accepted that dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays a role in chronic tendon degeneration. Senescent cells, which have been associated with multiple degenerative pathologies in musculoskeletal tissues, secrete a highly pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that has potential to promote ECM breakdown. However, the role of senescent cells in the dysregulation of tendon ECM homeostasis is largely unknown. To assess this directly, we developed an in vitro model of induced cellular senescence in murine tendon explants. This novel technique enables us to study the isolated interactions of senescent cells and their native ECM without interference from age-related systemic changes. We document multiple biomarkers of cellular senescence in induced tendon explants including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and SASP production. We then utilize this in vitro senescence model to compare the ECM remodeling response of young, naturally aged, and senescent tendons to an altered mechanical stimulus. We found that both senescence and aging independently led to alterations in ECM-related gene expression, reductions in protein synthesis, and tissue compositional changes. Furthermore, MMP activity was sustained, thus shifting the remodeling balance of aged and senescent tissues towards degradation over production. Together, this demonstrates that cellular senescence plays a role in the altered mechano-response of aged tendons and likely contributes to poor clinical outcomes in aging populations.\nStructure-conditioned masked language models for protein sequence design generalize beyond the native sequence space\nAuthors: Akpinaroglu, D.; Seki, K.; Guo, A.; Zhu, E.; Kelly, M. J.; Kortemme, T.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571823\nMachine learning has revolutionized computational protein design, enabling significant progress in protein backbone generation and sequence design. Here, we introduce Frame2seq, a structure-conditioned masked language model for protein sequence design. Frame2seq generates sequences in a single pass, achieves 49.1% sequence recovery on the CATH 4.2 test dataset, and accurately estimates the error in its own predictions, outperforming the autoregressive ProteinMPNN model with over six times faster inference. To probe the ability of Frame2seq to generate novel designs beyond the native-like sequence space it was trained on, we experimentally test 26 Frame2seq designs for de novo backbones with low identity to the starting sequences. We show that Frame2seq successfully designs soluble (22/26), monomeric, folded, and stable proteins (17/26), including a design with 0% sequence identity to native. The speed and accuracy of Frame2seq will accelerate exploration of novel sequence space across diverse design tasks, including challenging applications such as multi-objective optimization.\nAllosteric Modulation of Fluorescence Revealed by Hydrogen Bond Dynamics in a Genetically Encoded Maltose Biosensor\nAuthors: BERKSOZ, M.; ATILGAN, C.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572600\nGenetically encoded fluorescent biosensors (GEFBs) proved to be reliable tracers for many metabolites and cellular processes. In the simplest case, a fluorescent protein (FP) is genetically fused to a sensing protein which undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding. This drives a rearrangement in the chromophore environment and changes the spectral properties of the FP. Structural determinants of successful biosensors are revealed only in hindsight when the crystal structures of both ligand-bound and ligand-free forms are available. This makes the development of new biosensors for desired analytes a long trial-and-error process. In the current study, we conducted {micro}s-long all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a maltose biosensor in both the apo (dark) and holo (bright) forms. We performed detailed hydrogen bond occupancy analyses to shed light on the mechanism of ligand induced conformational change in the sensor protein and its allosteric effect on the chromophore environment. We find that two strong indicators for distinguishing bright and dark states of biosensors are due to substantial changes in hydrogen bond dynamics in the system and solvent accessibility of the chromophore.\nDual carbon sequestration with photosynthetic living materials\nAuthors: Dranseike, D.; Cui, Y.; Ling, A. S.; Donat, F.; Bernhard, S.; Bernero, M.; Areeckal, A.; Qin, X.-H.; Oakey, J. S.; Dillenburger, B.; Studart, A. R.; Tibbitt, M. W.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572991\nNatural ecosystems offer efficient pathways for carbon sequestration, serving as a resilient approach to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with minimal environmental impact. However, the control of living systems outside of their native environments is often challenging. Here, we engineered a photosynthetic living material for dual CO2 sequestration by immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms within a printable polymeric network. The carbon concentrating mechanism of the cyanobacteria enabled accumulation of CO2 within the cell, resulting in biomass production. Additionally, the metabolic production of OH- ions in the surrounding medium created an environment for the formation of insoluble carbonates via microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Digital design and fabrication of the living material ensured sufficient access to light and nutrient transport of the encapsulated cyanobacteria, which were essential for long-term viability (more than one year) as well as efficient photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. The photosynthetic living materials sequestered approximately 2.5 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material over 30 days via dual carbon sequestration, with 2.2 {+/-} 0.9 mg stored as insoluble carbonates. Over an extended incubation period of 400 days, the living materials sequestered 26 {+/-} 7 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material in the form of stable minerals. These findings highlight the potential of photosynthetic living materials for scalable carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral infrastructure, and green building materials. The simplicity of maintenance, coupled with its scalability nature, suggests broad applications of photosynthetic living materials as a complementary strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions.\nSingle cell transcriptomics reveals chondrocyte differentiation dynamics in vivo and in vitro\nAuthors: Lawrence, J. E. G.; Woods, S.; Roberts, K.; Sumanaweera, D. N.; Balogh, P.; Predeus, A. V.; He, P.; Li, T.; Polanski, K.; Prigmore, E.; Tuck, E.; Mamanova, L.; Zhou, D.; Webb, S.; Jardine, L.; He, X.; Barker, R. A.; Haniffa, M.; Flanagan, A. M.; Young, M. D.; Behjati, S.; Bayraktar, O.; Kimber, S. J.; Teichmann, S.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572425\nThe consistent production of in vitro chondrocytes that faithfully recapitulate in vivo development would be of great benefit for musculoskeletal disease modelling and regenerative medicine. Current efforts are often limited by off-target differentiation, resulting in a heterogeneous product. Furthermore, the lack of comparison to human embryonic tissue, precludes detailed evaluation of in vitro cells. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of embryonic long bones dissected from first trimester hind limbs from a range of gestational ages. We combine this with publicly available data to form a detailed atlas of endochondral ossification, which we then use to evaluate a series of published in vitro chondrogenesis protocols, finding substantial variability in cell states produced by each. We apply single-nuclear RNA sequencing to one protocol to enable direct comparison between in vitro and in vivo, and perform trajectory alignment between the two to reveal differentiation dynamics at the single-cell level, shedding new light on off-target differentiation in vitro. Using this information, we inhibit the activity of FOXO1, a transcription factor predicted to be active in embryonic bone development and in chondrogenic cells in vitro, and increase chondrocyte transcripts in vitro. This study therefore presents a new framework for evaluating tissue engineering protocols, using single-cell data from human development to drive improvement and bring the prospect of true engineered cartilage closer to reality.\nMagnetoelectric Nanodiscs Enable Wireless Transgene-Free Neuromodulation\nAuthors: Kim, Y. J.; Driscoll, N.; Kent, N.; Vargas Paniagua, E.; Tabet, A.; Koehler, F.; Manthey, M.; Sahasrabudhe, A.; Signorelli, L.; Gregurec, D.; Anikeeva, P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573272\nDeep-brain stimulation (DBS) with implanted electrodes revolutionized treatment of movement disorders and empowered neuroscience studies. Identifying less invasive alternatives to DBS may further extend its clinical and research applications. Nanomaterial-mediated transduction of magnetic fields into electric potentials offers an alternative to invasive DBS. Here, we synthesize magnetoelectric nanodiscs (MENDs) with a core-double shell Fe3O4-CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 architecture with efficient magnetoelectric coupling. We find robust responses to magnetic field stimulation in neurons decorated with MENDs at a density of 1 {micro}g/mm2 despite individual-particle potentials below the neuronal excitation threshold. We propose a model for repetitive subthreshold depolarization, which combined with cable theory, corroborates our findings in vitro and informs magnetoelectric stimulation in vivo. MENDs injected into the ventral tegmental area of genetically intact mice at concentrations of 1 mg/mL enable remote control of reward behavior, setting the stage for mechanistic optimization of magnetoelectric neuromodulation and inspiring its future applications in fundamental and translational neuroscience.\nRationally designed modular STAT-activating scaffolds enforce cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs augmenting the anti-tumor potency of CAR T cells\nAuthors: Saxby, C. P.; Ishida, T. K.; Rosser, J. M.; Curtis, B. C.; Baldwin, M. L.; Spurrell, C. H.; Giles, J.; Valdez, A.; Johnson, A. J.; Gustafson, J.; Appelbaum, J. S.; Jensen, M. C.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573170\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells can mediate anti-tumor responses in a variety of preclinical models and clinical settings, however, strategies to enhance anti-tumor potency is the subject of intense investigation. Signals emanating from gamma-c cytokine receptors modulate the transcriptional state of activated T cells impacting proliferation, survival, differentiation, and effector functioning through the STAT family of transcription factors. Design of ligand-independent cell-intrinsic cytokine STAT activation scaffolds is a conceptually attractive strategy to provide CAR T cells with a surrogate for exogenous cytokine support. Here, we designed a series of ligand-autonomous STAT inducer (LASI) scaffolds comprised of an extracellular identification tag, a homodimerizing transmembrane domain, and a membrane proximal IL7R Box1 domain followed by STAT5 and/or STAT3 docking sequences derived from IL7R and IL21R, respectively. We constructed LASI scaffolds having STAT5 (LASI-5), STAT3 (LASI-3), and combined STAT5 and STAT3 (LASI-5+3) docking domains and then interrogated their impact in primary human CD8+ anti-CD19 (4-1BB:zeta) CAR T cells. While LASI-5 expression had limited effects on CAR T cells, LASI-3 transcriptional programming was found to be indispensable to achieving anti-tumor functional enhancement associated with limited terminal differentiation, heightened T cell proliferation in response to antigen, and dampened expression of exhaustion-associated genes. Moreover, CAR T cells supplemented with LASI-3 or 5+3 displayed superior potency against human leukemia tumors in NSG mice. LASI-5+3 mediated the highest magnitude of CAR T cell engraftment in vivo that evolved into a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome. However, the same efficacy enhancement was achieved with LASI-3 without the lymphoproliferative complication. Our findings provide a rationale for utilization of constitutively expressed LASI-3 to enhance the anti-tumor potency of CAR T cells, the need to regulate the activity of LASI-5+3, and a generalizable scaffold design for studying additional combinations of STAT family transcription factors.\nCell-Free Optimized Production of Protoporphyrin IX\nAuthors: Garcia, D. C.; Davies, J. P.; Rhea, K.; Lee, M. S.; Lux, M. W.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573540\nBackground: The asymmetric and aromatic structures of porphyrins enable semiconducting properties allowing them to absorb light to initiate complex photocatalytic activity. These properties coupled with biological origins have garnered these molecules and their derivatives wide interest as a biotechnological platform. However, porphyrin production in cells is challenging due to limited titers, long production timescales, and difficult purification. Results: A cell-free metabolic engineering platform was constructed to produce protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) from E. coli crude extracts. Using acoustic liquid-handling, design of experiments for high-throughput buffer optimization and co-culturing techniques for extract production, our cell-free reactions effectively produced 0.109 mg/mL quantities of porphyrins. Conclusions: The use of cell-free metabolic engineering as a bioproduction platform could improve the production of toxic or inefficient biomolecules such as PPIX. The engineering strategies applied in this study provide a roadmap towards increasing the scale of cell-free metabolic engineering by elucidating batch to batch variability, as well as the need for batch specific optimization of reaction conditions.\nThermo-Responsive Polymers Targeting Inflammation in Murine Colitis\nAuthors: Zhang, S.; Jin, A. T.; Tang, W.; Zhang, R. Y.; Jing, L.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, H.; Lennerz, J. K.; Korzenik, J. R.; Langer, R.; Traverso, G.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573545\nTargeting the site of inflammation is an ideal approach for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammation targeting enables maximal drug-on-target effects while minimizing off-target side effects. Negatively charged drug carriers have been shown to facilitate drug delivery to inflamed colon mucosa after local administration. To modulate the negative charges and integrate responsiveness to stimuli, here we describe thermo-responsive, inflammation-targeting (TRIT) hydrogels based on functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (PNIPAM-MAA). We show that both chemical modification types and polymer molecular weights affect the resultant microgels' adhesion to the inflamed colon in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis in vivo. Further, we quantified the correlations between microgels' adhesion and colitis severity for individual mice, demonstrating that the microgels' adhesion correlated directly with weight loss percentage in DSS-treated mice. By exploiting charge-mediated interaction and thermo-responsiveness, TRIT hydrogels represent a promising strategy to target inflamed colon mucosa as a drug delivery platform for colonic IBD treatment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although adeno-associated virus (AAV) has enjoyed enormous success as a delivery modality for gene therapy, it continues to suffer from the high prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies in human populations, limiting who can receive potentially life-saving treatments. In this regard, AAV therapies generally also must be administered as a single dose since neutralizing antibodies develop in patients who receive the virus. Strategies for circumventing these issues remain limited. As a novel solution, we employed SpyTag-SpyCatcher molecular glue technology to facilitate packaging of AAVs inside of recombinant protein vault nanoparticles. Vaults are endogenous proteinaceous organelles produced by mammalian cells, so they are recognized as self by the immune system. They therefore can shield packaged molecules from neutralizing antibodies. Vault has previously been utilized to deliver drugs and proteins into cells, but our study represents the first time anyone has packaged an entire virus inside of vault. We showed that our vaultAAV (VAAV) delivery vehicle transduces cells in the presence of anti-AAV neutralizing serum. VAAV is positioned as a new gene therapy delivery platform with potential to overcome the neutralizing antibody problem and perhaps even allow administration of multiple doses, expanding the scope of AAV treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Musculoskeletal injuries, including tendinopathies, present a significant clinical burden for aging populations. While the biological drivers of age-related declines in tendon function are poorly understood, it is well accepted that dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays a role in chronic tendon degeneration. Senescent cells, which have been associated with multiple degenerative pathologies in musculoskeletal tissues, secrete a highly pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that has potential to promote ECM breakdown. However, the role of senescent cells in the dysregulation of tendon ECM homeostasis is largely unknown. To assess this directly, we developed an in vitro model of induced cellular senescence in murine tendon explants. This novel technique enables us to study the isolated interactions of senescent cells and their native ECM without interference from age-related systemic changes. We document multiple biomarkers of cellular senescence in induced tendon explants including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and SASP production. We then utilize this in vitro senescence model to compare the ECM remodeling response of young, naturally aged, and senescent tendons to an altered mechanical stimulus. We found that both senescence and aging independently led to alterations in ECM-related gene expression, reductions in protein synthesis, and tissue compositional changes. Furthermore, MMP activity was sustained, thus shifting the remodeling balance of aged and senescent tissues towards degradation over production. Together, this demonstrates that cellular senescence plays a role in the altered mechano-response of aged tendons and likely contributes to poor clinical outcomes in aging populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning has revolutionized computational protein design, enabling significant progress in protein backbone generation and sequence design. Here, we introduce Frame2seq, a structure-conditioned masked language model for protein sequence design. Frame2seq generates sequences in a single pass, achieves 49.1% sequence recovery on the CATH 4.2 test dataset, and accurately estimates the error in its own predictions, outperforming the autoregressive ProteinMPNN model with over six times faster inference. To probe the ability of Frame2seq to generate novel designs beyond the native-like sequence space it was trained on, we experimentally test 26 Frame2seq designs for de novo backbones with low identity to the starting sequences. We show that Frame2seq successfully designs soluble (22/26), monomeric, folded, and stable proteins (17/26), including a design with 0% sequence identity to native. The speed and accuracy of Frame2seq will accelerate exploration of novel sequence space across diverse design tasks, including challenging applications such as multi-objective optimization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors (GEFBs) proved to be reliable tracers for many metabolites and cellular processes. In the simplest case, a fluorescent protein (FP) is genetically fused to a sensing protein which undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding. This drives a rearrangement in the chromophore environment and changes the spectral properties of the FP. Structural determinants of successful biosensors are revealed only in hindsight when the crystal structures of both ligand-bound and ligand-free forms are available. This makes the development of new biosensors for desired analytes a long trial-and-error process. In the current study, we conducted {micro}s-long all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a maltose biosensor in both the apo (dark) and holo (bright) forms. We performed detailed hydrogen bond occupancy analyses to shed light on the mechanism of ligand induced conformational change in the sensor protein and its allosteric effect on the chromophore environment. We find that two strong indicators for distinguishing bright and dark states of biosensors are due to substantial changes in hydrogen bond dynamics in the system and solvent accessibility of the chromophore.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Natural ecosystems offer efficient pathways for carbon sequestration, serving as a resilient approach to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with minimal environmental impact. However, the control of living systems outside of their native environments is often challenging. Here, we engineered a photosynthetic living material for dual CO2 sequestration by immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms within a printable polymeric network. The carbon concentrating mechanism of the cyanobacteria enabled accumulation of CO2 within the cell, resulting in biomass production. Additionally, the metabolic production of OH- ions in the surrounding medium created an environment for the formation of insoluble carbonates via microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Digital design and fabrication of the living material ensured sufficient access to light and nutrient transport of the encapsulated cyanobacteria, which were essential for long-term viability (more than one year) as well as efficient photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. The photosynthetic living materials sequestered approximately 2.5 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material over 30 days via dual carbon sequestration, with 2.2 {&#43;/-} 0.9 mg stored as insoluble carbonates. Over an extended incubation period of 400 days, the living materials sequestered 26 {&#43;/-} 7 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material in the form of stable minerals. These findings highlight the potential of photosynthetic living materials for scalable carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral infrastructure, and green building materials. The simplicity of maintenance, coupled with its scalability nature, suggests broad applications of photosynthetic living materials as a complementary strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The consistent production of in vitro chondrocytes that faithfully recapitulate in vivo development would be of great benefit for musculoskeletal disease modelling and regenerative medicine. Current efforts are often limited by off-target differentiation, resulting in a heterogeneous product. Furthermore, the lack of comparison to human embryonic tissue, precludes detailed evaluation of in vitro cells. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of embryonic long bones dissected from first trimester hind limbs from a range of gestational ages. We combine this with publicly available data to form a detailed atlas of endochondral ossification, which we then use to evaluate a series of published in vitro chondrogenesis protocols, finding substantial variability in cell states produced by each. We apply single-nuclear RNA sequencing to one protocol to enable direct comparison between in vitro and in vivo, and perform trajectory alignment between the two to reveal differentiation dynamics at the single-cell level, shedding new light on off-target differentiation in vitro. Using this information, we inhibit the activity of FOXO1, a transcription factor predicted to be active in embryonic bone development and in chondrogenic cells in vitro, and increase chondrocyte transcripts in vitro. This study therefore presents a new framework for evaluating tissue engineering protocols, using single-cell data from human development to drive improvement and bring the prospect of true engineered cartilage closer to reality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) with implanted electrodes revolutionized treatment of movement disorders and empowered neuroscience studies. Identifying less invasive alternatives to DBS may further extend its clinical and research applications. Nanomaterial-mediated transduction of magnetic fields into electric potentials offers an alternative to invasive DBS. Here, we synthesize magnetoelectric nanodiscs (MENDs) with a core-double shell Fe3O4-CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 architecture with efficient magnetoelectric coupling. We find robust responses to magnetic field stimulation in neurons decorated with MENDs at a density of 1 {micro}g/mm2 despite individual-particle potentials below the neuronal excitation threshold. We propose a model for repetitive subthreshold depolarization, which combined with cable theory, corroborates our findings in vitro and informs magnetoelectric stimulation in vivo. MENDs injected into the ventral tegmental area of genetically intact mice at concentrations of 1 mg/mL enable remote control of reward behavior, setting the stage for mechanistic optimization of magnetoelectric neuromodulation and inspiring its future applications in fundamental and translational neuroscience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells can mediate anti-tumor responses in a variety of preclinical models and clinical settings, however, strategies to enhance anti-tumor potency is the subject of intense investigation. Signals emanating from gamma-c cytokine receptors modulate the transcriptional state of activated T cells impacting proliferation, survival, differentiation, and effector functioning through the STAT family of transcription factors. Design of ligand-independent cell-intrinsic cytokine STAT activation scaffolds is a conceptually attractive strategy to provide CAR T cells with a surrogate for exogenous cytokine support. Here, we designed a series of ligand-autonomous STAT inducer (LASI) scaffolds comprised of an extracellular identification tag, a homodimerizing transmembrane domain, and a membrane proximal IL7R Box1 domain followed by STAT5 and/or STAT3 docking sequences derived from IL7R and IL21R, respectively. We constructed LASI scaffolds having STAT5 (LASI-5), STAT3 (LASI-3), and combined STAT5 and STAT3 (LASI-5&#43;3) docking domains and then interrogated their impact in primary human CD8&#43; anti-CD19 (4-1BB:zeta) CAR T cells. While LASI-5 expression had limited effects on CAR T cells, LASI-3 transcriptional programming was found to be indispensable to achieving anti-tumor functional enhancement associated with limited terminal differentiation, heightened T cell proliferation in response to antigen, and dampened expression of exhaustion-associated genes. Moreover, CAR T cells supplemented with LASI-3 or 5&#43;3 displayed superior potency against human leukemia tumors in NSG mice. LASI-5&#43;3 mediated the highest magnitude of CAR T cell engraftment in vivo that evolved into a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome. However, the same efficacy enhancement was achieved with LASI-3 without the lymphoproliferative complication. Our findings provide a rationale for utilization of constitutively expressed LASI-3 to enhance the anti-tumor potency of CAR T cells, the need to regulate the activity of LASI-5&#43;3, and a generalizable scaffold design for studying additional combinations of STAT family transcription factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The asymmetric and aromatic structures of porphyrins enable semiconducting properties allowing them to absorb light to initiate complex photocatalytic activity. These properties coupled with biological origins have garnered these molecules and their derivatives wide interest as a biotechnological platform. However, porphyrin production in cells is challenging due to limited titers, long production timescales, and difficult purification. Results: A cell-free metabolic engineering platform was constructed to produce protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) from E. coli crude extracts. Using acoustic liquid-handling, design of experiments for high-throughput buffer optimization and co-culturing techniques for extract production, our cell-free reactions effectively produced 0.109 mg/mL quantities of porphyrins. Conclusions: The use of cell-free metabolic engineering as a bioproduction platform could improve the production of toxic or inefficient biomolecules such as PPIX. The engineering strategies applied in this study provide a roadmap towards increasing the scale of cell-free metabolic engineering by elucidating batch to batch variability, as well as the need for batch specific optimization of reaction conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeting the site of inflammation is an ideal approach for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammation targeting enables maximal drug-on-target effects while minimizing off-target side effects. Negatively charged drug carriers have been shown to facilitate drug delivery to inflamed colon mucosa after local administration. To modulate the negative charges and integrate responsiveness to stimuli, here we describe thermo-responsive, inflammation-targeting (TRIT) hydrogels based on functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (PNIPAM-MAA). We show that both chemical modification types and polymer molecular weights affect the resultant microgels&#39; adhesion to the inflamed colon in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis in vivo. Further, we quantified the correlations between microgels&#39; adhesion and colitis severity for individual mice, demonstrating that the microgels&#39; adhesion correlated directly with weight loss percentage in DSS-treated mice. By exploiting charge-mediated interaction and thermo-responsiveness, TRIT hydrogels represent a promising strategy to target inflamed colon mucosa as a drug delivery platform for colonic IBD treatment.</p>
