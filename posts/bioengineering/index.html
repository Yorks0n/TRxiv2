One of them, ProteinMPNN, predicts an amino acid sequence that would fold and match user-defined backbone structure. In this short report, we test whether ProteinMPNN can be used to reengineer a flavin-binding fluorescent protein, CagFbFP. We fixed the native backbone conformation and the identity of 20 amino acids interacting with the chromophore (flavin mononucleotide, FMN), while letting ProteinMPNN predict the rest of the sequence. The software package suggested replacing 36-48 out of the remaining 86 amino acids. The three designs that we tested experimentally displayed different expression levels, yet all were able to bind FMN and displayed fluorescence, thermal stability and other properties similar to those of CagFbFP. Our results demonstrate that ProteinMPNN can be used to generate diverging unnatural variants of fluorescent proteins, and, more generally, to reengineer proteins without losing their ligand-binding capabilities.\nNon-invasive measurement of intra-tumoral fluid dynamics with localized convolutional function regression\nAuthors: Woodall, R. T.; Esparza, C. C.; Gutova, M.; Wang, M.; Cunningham-Reynolds, J.; Brummer, A. B.; Stine, C.; Brown, C.; Munson, J. M.; Rockne, R. C.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554919\nDynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a routine method to non-invasively quantify perfusion dynamics in tissues. The standard practice for analyzing DCE-MRI data is to fit an ordinary differential equation to each voxel. Recent advances in data science provide an opportunity to move beyond existing methods to obtain more accurate measurements of fluid properties. Here we present localized convolutional function regression, simultaneously measuring interstitial fluid velocity, diffusion, and perfusion in 3D. We validate the method computationally and experimentally, demonstrating accurate measurement of fluid dynamics in situ and in vivo. Applying the method to human MRIs, we observe tissue-specific differences in fluid dynamics, with an increased fluid velocity in breast cancer as compared to brain cancer. One-Sentence SummaryA physics-informed computational method enables accurate and efficient measurement of fluid dynamics in individual patient tumors and demonstrates differences between tissues.\nControlled disturbed flows on the endothelium result in increased inflammation, nuclear lamin disruption and heterochromatin condensation\nAuthors: Paddillaya, N.; Mahulkar, S.; Arakeri, J.; Gundiah, N.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.555040\nEarly atherosclerotic lesions often develop in arterial bifurcations and curvatures that experience complex disturbed flows. Lab-on-chip devices primarily adopt laminar unidirectional and oscillatory flows to characterize endothelial mechanobiology and test therapeutics. Such flows do not reproduce the time-varying, bidirectional, and complicated shear patterns on arterial walls. We fabricated an endothelium-on-chip device and developed a semi-analytical model to produce any prescribed wall shear pattern characterized by a shear rosette. We quantified responses of Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) monolayers subjected to unidirectional laminar (Uni-L) and oscillatory (Uni-O) flows in straight microfluidic channels, and a circular shear rosette (Bi-O), defined by bidirectional oscillatory flows, in the new device. Immunofluorescence results show well-defined stress fibers and VE-cadherin under laminar flows. Cells were more cuboidal with significantly larger nuclear areas in the device as compared to other groups. Lamin A/C disruption and heterochromatin reorganization were evident in nuclei of cells in the Bi-O group but were absent in the Uni-L and No-flow control groups. Cells showed significantly elevated actin, VE-cadherin, inflammatory NF-kB, and lamin expressions in the device compared to other groups. A device to create controlled disturbed flows offers a platform to assess mechanobiology, has significant potential in personalized medicine, and reduces reliance on animal trials.\nStructural Determinants of Tendon Function During Development and Their Sensitivity to Mechanical Stimulation\nAuthors: Peterson, B. E.; Canonicco Castro, M. L.; McCarthy, H.; Buckley, N.; Dunne, N.; Rolfe, R. A.; Murphy, P.; Szczesny, S.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554314\nThe load-bearing capabilities of tendon are acquired during neonatal stages of development, characterized by an abrupt increase in multiscale mechanical properties. While prior work has identified numerous changes within the collagenous structure during these developmental periods, the primary structural elements that give rise to this abrupt mechanical functionality, and their mechanobiological sensitivity, remains unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we leveraged a combination of ultrastructural imaging, biochemical/thermodynamic assays, multiscale mechanical testing, and shear lag modeling to probe the dynamic structure-function relationships and establish their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation during tenogenesis. Mechanical testing and modeling suggested that the rapid increase in multiscale mechanics can be explained by a increasing fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. To test this, we inhibited collagen crosslinking during development and observed a drastic reduction in multiscale mechanical capabilities that was explained by a reduction in both fibril modulus and length. Using muscle paralysis to investigate mechanosensitivity, we observed a significantly impaired multiscale mechanical response despite small changes in fibril diameter and fibril area fraction. While there was no change in crosslinking density, there was a decrease in thermal stability with flaccid paralysis, and our shear-lag model suggested that flaccid paralysis produces a reduction in fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. Together, these data suggest that both intrafibrillar crosslink formation and fibril elongation are critical to the formation of load-bearing capabilities in tenogenesis and are sensitive to musculoskeletal activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biological mechanisms that give rise to load-bearing soft tissue.\nBioengineering of a human innervated cardiac muscle model\nAuthors: Schneider, L. V.; Bao, G.; Methi, A.; Jensen, O.; Schmoll, K. A.; Setya, M. G.; Sakib, M. S.; Fahud, A. L.; Brockmoeller, J.; Fischer, A.; Liaw, N. Y.; Zimmermann, W.-H.; Zafeiriou, M.-P.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.552653\nCardiac autonomic neurons control cardiac contractility. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system can lead to sympathetic overdrive resulting in heart failure and an increased incidence of fatal arrhythmias. Here, we introduce innervated engineered human myocardium (iEHM), a novel model of neuro-cardiac junctions, constructed by fusion of a bioengineered neural organoid (BENO) patterned to autonomic nervous system and engineered human myocardium (EHM). Projections of sympathetic neurons into engineered human myocardium formed presynaptic terminals in close proximity to cardiomyocytes and an extensive vascular network co-developing in the tissues. Contractile responses to optogenetic stimulation of the accordingly engineered neuronal component demonstrated functionality of neuro-cardiac junctions in iEHM. This model will serve as a human surrogate system to delineate neuron and cardiac cell contribution to brain and heart diseases and is an important step towards engineering a human brain to heart axis in a dish.\nImmune Response of Transplanted Kidney Tissues Assembled from Organoid Building Blocks\nAuthors: Borges, T.

A.; Riella, L. V.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.551822\nThe increasing scarcity of organs and the significant morbidity linked to dialysis requires the development of engineered kidney tissues from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. To accomplish this, integrative approaches that synergize scalable kidney organoid differentiation, tissue biomanufacturing, and comprehensive assessment of their immune response and host integration are essential. Here, we create engineered human kidney tissues composed of kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) and transplant them into mice reconstituted with allogeneic human immune cells. We assess their host vascular integration, in vivo maturation, and their ability to trigger human immune responses. Tissue-infiltrating human immune cells are composed of effector T cells and innate cells. This immune infiltration leads to kidney tissue injury characterized by reduced microvasculature, enhanced kidney cell apoptosis, and a unique inflammatory gene signature comparable to kidney organ transplant rejection in humans. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressive agent Rapamycin, the induced immune response is greatly suppressed. Our model serves as a translational platform to study engineered kidney tissue immunogenicity and develop novel therapeutic targets for kidney rejection.\nOptoDyCE-plate as an affordable high throughput imager for all optical cardiac electrophysiology\nAuthors: Heinson, Y.; Han, J. L.; Entcheva, E.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555447\nWe present a simple low-cost system for comprehensive functional characterization of cardiac function under spontaneous and paced conditions, in standard 96 and 384-well plates. This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium from all wells in parallel. The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 394-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated deployment of optogenetic cell spheroids for point pacing to study conduction in 96-well format, and the use of temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera in this stand-alone platform. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates, in the various configurations. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.\nTunable biomimetic materials elaborated by ice templating and self-assembly of collagen for tubular tissue engineering\nAuthors: Martinier, I.; Fage, F.; Kakar, A.; Castagnino, A.; Saindoy, E.; Frederick, J.; Onorati, I.; Besnard, V.; Barakat, A.; Dard, N.; Martinod, E.; Planes, C.; Trichet, L.; Fernandes, F. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555553\nSynthetic tubular grafts currently used in clinical context fail frequently, and the expectations that biomimetic materials could tackle these limitations are high. However, developing tubular materials presenting structural, compositional and functional properties close to those of native tissues remains an unmet challenge. Here we describe a combination of ice templating and topotactic fibrillogenesis of type I collagen, the main component of tissues' extracellular matrix, yielding highly concentrated yet porous tubular collagen materials with controlled hierarchical architecture at multiple length scales, the hallmark of native tissues' organization. By modulating the thermal conductivity of the cylindrical molds, we tune the macroscopic porosity defined by ice. Coupling the aforementioned porosity patterns with two different fibrillogenesis routes results in a new family of materials whose textural features and the supramolecular arrangement of type I collagen are achieved. The resulting materials present hierarchical elastic properties and are successfully colonized by human endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells on the luminal side, and by human mesenchymal stem cells on the external side. The results reported here demonstrate the relevance of the proposed straightforward protocol, likely to be adapted for larger graft sizes, to address ever-growing clinical needs such as peripheral arterial disease or tracheal and bronchial reconstructions.\nAlternating Magnetic Fields Drive Stimulation of Gene Expression via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species\nAuthors: Mundell, J.; Brier, M.; Orloff, E.; Stanley, S. A.; Dordick, J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555804\nMagnetogenetics represents a method for remote control of cellular function. Despite successful use of magnetic fields to control gene expression in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying magnetogenetics is largely unknown, thereby hindering further development and applications. Previous work suggests a chemical-based mechanism involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a platform initiator and downstream signaling molecule. Herein, a chemical biology approach was used to elucidate further the mechanism of radio frequency-alternating magnetic field (RF-AMF) stimulation of a TRPV1-ferritin magnetogenetics platform that leads to Ca2+ gating. RF-AMF stimulation of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPV1-Ferritin resulted in a ~30% and ~140% increase in intra- and extracellular ROS levels, respectively. Mutations to specific cysteine residues in TRPV1 responsible for ROS sensitivity eliminated RF-AMF driven Ca2+-dependent transcription of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Using a non-tethered (to TRPV1) ferritin also eliminated RF-AMF driven SEAP production. These results suggest ferritin-dependent ROS activation of TRPV1 plays a key role in the initiation of magnetogenetics. Furthermore, inhibition of IP3R-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release with Xestospongin C, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with Go 6983, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1/2 gp91phox cytochrome with GSK 2795039 eliminated short-term RF-AMF potentiation of SEAP production with capsaicin. Similarly, Go 6983 significantly reduced long-term RF-AMF capsaicin potentiation of SEAP production. These results suggest that ROS-activated TRPV1 signaling to increase intracellular Ca2+ includes pathways involving PKC, NOX, and the ER. Together, these findings fill in current knowledge gaps in the mechanism of magnetogenetics, which may lead to translational applications in medicine and biotechnology.\nHuman plasma cells engineered to secrete bispecifics drive effective in vivo leukemia killing\nAuthors: Hill, T. F.; Narvekar, P.; Asher, G.; Camp, N.; Thomas, K. R.; Tasian, S. K.; Rawlings, D. J.; James, R. G.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554523\nBispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. Advances in genome-engineering have enabled the generation of human plasma cells that secrete therapeutic proteins and are capable of long-term in vivo engraftment in humanized mouse models. As a next step towards clinical translation of engineered plasma cells (ePCs) towards cancer therapy, here we describe approaches for the expression and secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human ePCs expressing either fragment crystallizable domain deficient anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 x anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of specific primary human cell subsets and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19 bispecific secretion by ePCs and prevents self-targeting. Further, anti-CD19 bispecific-ePCs elicited tumor eradication in vivo following local delivery in flank-implanted Raji lymphoma cells. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with anti-CD19 bispecific-ePCs and autologous T cells potently prevented in vivo growth of CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, these findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable, local delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in machine learning techniques have led to development of a number of protein design and engineering approaches. One of them, ProteinMPNN, predicts an amino acid sequence that would fold and match user-defined backbone structure. In this short report, we test whether ProteinMPNN can be used to reengineer a flavin-binding fluorescent protein, CagFbFP. We fixed the native backbone conformation and the identity of 20 amino acids interacting with the chromophore (flavin mononucleotide, FMN), while letting ProteinMPNN predict the rest of the sequence. The software package suggested replacing 36-48 out of the remaining 86 amino acids. The three designs that we tested experimentally displayed different expression levels, yet all were able to bind FMN and displayed fluorescence, thermal stability and other properties similar to those of CagFbFP. Our results demonstrate that ProteinMPNN can be used to generate diverging unnatural variants of fluorescent proteins, and, more generally, to reengineer proteins without losing their ligand-binding capabilities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a routine method to non-invasively quantify perfusion dynamics in tissues. The standard practice for analyzing DCE-MRI data is to fit an ordinary differential equation to each voxel. Recent advances in data science provide an opportunity to move beyond existing methods to obtain more accurate measurements of fluid properties. Here we present localized convolutional function regression, simultaneously measuring interstitial fluid velocity, diffusion, and perfusion in 3D. We validate the method computationally and experimentally, demonstrating accurate measurement of fluid dynamics in situ and in vivo. Applying the method to human MRIs, we observe tissue-specific differences in fluid dynamics, with an increased fluid velocity in breast cancer as compared to brain cancer.

One-Sentence SummaryA physics-informed computational method enables accurate and efficient measurement of fluid dynamics in individual patient tumors and demonstrates differences between tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early atherosclerotic lesions often develop in arterial bifurcations and curvatures that experience complex disturbed flows. Lab-on-chip devices primarily adopt laminar unidirectional and oscillatory flows to characterize endothelial mechanobiology and test therapeutics. Such flows do not reproduce the time-varying, bidirectional, and complicated shear patterns on arterial walls. We fabricated an endothelium-on-chip device and developed a semi-analytical model to produce any prescribed wall shear pattern characterized by a shear rosette. We quantified responses of Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) monolayers subjected to unidirectional laminar (Uni-L) and oscillatory (Uni-O) flows in straight microfluidic channels, and a circular shear rosette (Bi-O), defined by bidirectional oscillatory flows, in the new device. Immunofluorescence results show well-defined stress fibers and VE-cadherin under laminar flows. Cells were more cuboidal with significantly larger nuclear areas in the device as compared to other groups. Lamin A/C disruption and heterochromatin reorganization were evident in nuclei of cells in the Bi-O group but were absent in the Uni-L and No-flow control groups. Cells showed significantly elevated actin, VE-cadherin, inflammatory NF-kB, and lamin expressions in the device compared to other groups. A device to create controlled disturbed flows offers a platform to assess mechanobiology, has significant potential in personalized medicine, and reduces reliance on animal trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The load-bearing capabilities of tendon are acquired during neonatal stages of development, characterized by an abrupt increase in multiscale mechanical properties. While prior work has identified numerous changes within the collagenous structure during these developmental periods, the primary structural elements that give rise to this abrupt mechanical functionality, and their mechanobiological sensitivity, remains unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we leveraged a combination of ultrastructural imaging, biochemical/thermodynamic assays, multiscale mechanical testing, and shear lag modeling to probe the dynamic structure-function relationships and establish their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation during tenogenesis. Mechanical testing and modeling suggested that the rapid increase in multiscale mechanics can be explained by a increasing fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. To test this, we inhibited collagen crosslinking during development and observed a drastic reduction in multiscale mechanical capabilities that was explained by a reduction in both fibril modulus and length. Using muscle paralysis to investigate mechanosensitivity, we observed a significantly impaired multiscale mechanical response despite small changes in fibril diameter and fibril area fraction. While there was no change in crosslinking density, there was a decrease in thermal stability with flaccid paralysis, and our shear-lag model suggested that flaccid paralysis produces a reduction in fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. Together, these data suggest that both intrafibrillar crosslink formation and fibril elongation are critical to the formation of load-bearing capabilities in tenogenesis and are sensitive to musculoskeletal activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biological mechanisms that give rise to load-bearing soft tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac autonomic neurons control cardiac contractility. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system can lead to sympathetic overdrive resulting in heart failure and an increased incidence of fatal arrhythmias. Here, we introduce innervated engineered human myocardium (iEHM), a novel model of neuro-cardiac junctions, constructed by fusion of a bioengineered neural organoid (BENO) patterned to autonomic nervous system and engineered human myocardium (EHM). Projections of sympathetic neurons into engineered human myocardium formed presynaptic terminals in close proximity to cardiomyocytes and an extensive vascular network co-developing in the tissues. Contractile responses to optogenetic stimulation of the accordingly engineered neuronal component demonstrated functionality of neuro-cardiac junctions in iEHM. This model will serve as a human surrogate system to delineate neuron and cardiac cell contribution to brain and heart diseases and is an important step towards engineering a human brain to heart axis in a dish.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing scarcity of organs and the significant morbidity linked to dialysis requires the development of engineered kidney tissues from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. To accomplish this, integrative approaches that synergize scalable kidney organoid differentiation, tissue biomanufacturing, and comprehensive assessment of their immune response and host integration are essential. Here, we create engineered human kidney tissues composed of kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) and transplant them into mice reconstituted with allogeneic human immune cells. We assess their host vascular integration, in vivo maturation, and their ability to trigger human immune responses. Tissue-infiltrating human immune cells are composed of effector T cells and innate cells. This immune infiltration leads to kidney tissue injury characterized by reduced microvasculature, enhanced kidney cell apoptosis, and a unique inflammatory gene signature comparable to kidney organ transplant rejection in humans. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressive agent Rapamycin, the induced immune response is greatly suppressed. Our model serves as a translational platform to study engineered kidney tissue immunogenicity and develop novel therapeutic targets for kidney rejection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present a simple low-cost system for comprehensive functional characterization of cardiac function under spontaneous and paced conditions, in standard 96 and 384-well plates. This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium from all wells in parallel. The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 394-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated deployment of optogenetic cell spheroids for point pacing to study conduction in 96-well format, and the use of temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera in this stand-alone platform. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates, in the various configurations. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic tubular grafts currently used in clinical context fail frequently, and the expectations that biomimetic materials could tackle these limitations are high. However, developing tubular materials presenting structural, compositional and functional properties close to those of native tissues remains an unmet challenge. Here we describe a combination of ice templating and topotactic fibrillogenesis of type I collagen, the main component of tissues&#39; extracellular matrix, yielding highly concentrated yet porous tubular collagen materials with controlled hierarchical architecture at multiple length scales, the hallmark of native tissues&#39; organization. By modulating the thermal conductivity of the cylindrical molds, we tune the macroscopic porosity defined by ice. Coupling the aforementioned porosity patterns with two different fibrillogenesis routes results in a new family of materials whose textural features and the supramolecular arrangement of type I collagen are achieved. The resulting materials present hierarchical elastic properties and are successfully colonized by human endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells on the luminal side, and by human mesenchymal stem cells on the external side. The results reported here demonstrate the relevance of the proposed straightforward protocol, likely to be adapted for larger graft sizes, to address ever-growing clinical needs such as peripheral arterial disease or tracheal and bronchial reconstructions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Magnetogenetics represents a method for remote control of cellular function. Despite successful use of magnetic fields to control gene expression in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying magnetogenetics is largely unknown, thereby hindering further development and applications. Previous work suggests a chemical-based mechanism involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a platform initiator and downstream signaling molecule. Herein, a chemical biology approach was used to elucidate further the mechanism of radio frequency-alternating magnetic field (RF-AMF) stimulation of a TRPV1-ferritin magnetogenetics platform that leads to Ca2&#43; gating. RF-AMF stimulation of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPV1-Ferritin resulted in a ~30% and ~140% increase in intra- and extracellular ROS levels, respectively. Mutations to specific cysteine residues in TRPV1 responsible for ROS sensitivity eliminated RF-AMF driven Ca2&#43;-dependent transcription of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Using a non-tethered (to TRPV1) ferritin also eliminated RF-AMF driven SEAP production. These results suggest ferritin-dependent ROS activation of TRPV1 plays a key role in the initiation of magnetogenetics. Furthermore, inhibition of IP3R-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2&#43; release with Xestospongin C, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with Go 6983, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1/2 gp91phox cytochrome with GSK 2795039 eliminated short-term RF-AMF potentiation of SEAP production with capsaicin. Similarly, Go 6983 significantly reduced long-term RF-AMF capsaicin potentiation of SEAP production. These results suggest that ROS-activated TRPV1 signaling to increase intracellular Ca2&#43; includes pathways involving PKC, NOX, and the ER. Together, these findings fill in current knowledge gaps in the mechanism of magnetogenetics, which may lead to translational applications in medicine and biotechnology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. Advances in genome-engineering have enabled the generation of human plasma cells that secrete therapeutic proteins and are capable of long-term in vivo engraftment in humanized mouse models. As a next step towards clinical translation of engineered plasma cells (ePCs) towards cancer therapy, here we describe approaches for the expression and secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human ePCs expressing either fragment crystallizable domain deficient anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 x anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of specific primary human cell subsets and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19 bispecific secretion by ePCs and prevents self-targeting. Further, anti-CD19 bispecific-ePCs elicited tumor eradication in vivo following local delivery in flank-implanted Raji lymphoma cells. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with anti-CD19 bispecific-ePCs and autologous T cells potently prevented in vivo growth of CD19&#43; acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, these findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable, local delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.
