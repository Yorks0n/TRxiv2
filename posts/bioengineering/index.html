Lab-on-chip devices primarily adopt laminar unidirectional and oscillatory flows to characterize endothelial mechanobiology and test therapeutics. Such flows do not reproduce the time-varying, bidirectional, and complicated shear patterns on arterial walls. We fabricated an endothelium-on-chip device and developed a semi-analytical model to produce any prescribed wall shear pattern characterized by a shear rosette. We quantified responses of Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) monolayers subjected to unidirectional laminar (Uni-L) and oscillatory (Uni-O) flows in straight microfluidic channels, and a circular shear rosette (Bi-O), defined by bidirectional oscillatory flows, in the new device. Immunofluorescence results show well-defined stress fibers and VE-cadherin under laminar flows. Cells were more cuboidal with significantly larger nuclear areas in the device as compared to other groups. Lamin A/C disruption and heterochromatin reorganization were evident in nuclei of cells in the Bi-O group but were absent in the Uni-L and No-flow control groups. Cells showed significantly elevated actin, VE-cadherin, inflammatory NF-kB, and lamin expressions in the device compared to other groups. A device to create controlled disturbed flows offers a platform to assess mechanobiology, has significant potential in personalized medicine, and reduces reliance on animal trials.\nNon-invasive measurement of intra-tumoral fluid dynamics with localized convolutional function regression\nAuthors: Woodall, R. T.; Esparza, C. C.; Gutova, M.; Wang, M.; Cunningham-Reynolds, J.; Brummer, A. B.; Stine, C.; Brown, C.; Munson, J. M.; Rockne, R. C.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554919\nDynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a routine method to non-invasively quantify perfusion dynamics in tissues. The standard practice for analyzing DCE-MRI data is to fit an ordinary differential equation to each voxel. Recent advances in data science provide an opportunity to move beyond existing methods to obtain more accurate measurements of fluid properties. Here we present localized convolutional function regression, simultaneously measuring interstitial fluid velocity, diffusion, and perfusion in 3D. We validate the method computationally and experimentally, demonstrating accurate measurement of fluid dynamics in situ and in vivo. Applying the method to human MRIs, we observe tissue-specific differences in fluid dynamics, with an increased fluid velocity in breast cancer as compared to brain cancer. One-Sentence SummaryA physics-informed computational method enables accurate and efficient measurement of fluid dynamics in individual patient tumors and demonstrates differences between tissues.\nHuman gut metagenomic mining reveals an untapped source of peptide antibiotics\nAuthors: Torres, M. D. T.; Brooks, E. F.; Cesaro, A.; Sberro, H.; Nicolaou, C.; Bhatt, A. S.; de la Fuente, C.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555711\nDrug-resistant bacteria are outpacing traditional antibiotic discovery efforts. Here, we computationally mined 444,054 families of putative small proteins from 1,773 human gut metagenomes, identifying 323 peptide antibiotics encoded in small open reading frames (smORFs). To test our computational predictions, 78 peptides were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity in vitro, with 59% displaying activity against either pathogens or commensals. Since these peptides were unique compared to previously reported antimicrobial peptides, we termed them smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs). SEPs killed bacteria by targeting their membrane, synergized with each other, and modulated gut commensals, indicating that they may play a role in reconfiguring microbiome communities in addition to counteracting pathogens. The lead candidates were anti-infective in both murine skin abscess and deep thigh infection models. Notably, prevotellin-2 from Prevotella copri presented activity comparable to the commonly used antibiotic polymyxin B. We report the discovery of hundreds of peptide sequences in the human gut.\nImmune Response of Transplanted Kidney Tissues Assembled from Organoid Building Blocks\nAuthors: Borges, T.

A.; Riella, L. V.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.551822\nThe increasing scarcity of organs and the significant morbidity linked to dialysis requires the development of engineered kidney tissues from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. To accomplish this, integrative approaches that synergize scalable kidney organoid differentiation, tissue biomanufacturing, and comprehensive assessment of their immune response and host integration are essential. Here, we create engineered human kidney tissues composed of kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) and transplant them into mice reconstituted with allogeneic human immune cells. We assess their host vascular integration, in vivo maturation, and their ability to trigger human immune responses. Tissue-infiltrating human immune cells are composed of effector T cells and innate cells. This immune infiltration leads to kidney tissue injury characterized by reduced microvasculature, enhanced kidney cell apoptosis, and a unique inflammatory gene signature comparable to kidney organ transplant rejection in humans. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressive agent Rapamycin, the induced immune response is greatly suppressed. Our model serves as a translational platform to study engineered kidney tissue immunogenicity and develop novel therapeutic targets for kidney rejection.\nOptoDyCE-plate as an affordable high throughput imager for all optical cardiac electrophysiology\nAuthors: Heinson, Y.; Han, J. L.; Entcheva, E.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555447\nWe present a simple low-cost system for comprehensive functional characterization of cardiac function under spontaneous and paced conditions, in standard 96 and 384-well plates. This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium from all wells in parallel. The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 394-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated deployment of optogenetic cell spheroids for point pacing to study conduction in 96-well format, and the use of temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera in this stand-alone platform. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates, in the various configurations. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.\nTunable biomimetic materials elaborated by ice templating and self-assembly of collagen for tubular tissue engineering\nAuthors: Martinier, I.; Fage, F.; Kakar, A.; Castagnino, A.; Saindoy, E.; Frederick, J.; Onorati, I.; Besnard, V.; Barakat, A.; Dard, N.; Martinod, E.; Planes, C.; Trichet, L.; Fernandes, F. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555553\nSynthetic tubular grafts currently used in clinical context fail frequently, and the expectations that biomimetic materials could tackle these limitations are high. However, developing tubular materials presenting structural, compositional and functional properties close to those of native tissues remains an unmet challenge. Here we describe a combination of ice templating and topotactic fibrillogenesis of type I collagen, the main component of tissues' extracellular matrix, yielding highly concentrated yet porous tubular collagen materials with controlled hierarchical architecture at multiple length scales, the hallmark of native tissues' organization. By modulating the thermal conductivity of the cylindrical molds, we tune the macroscopic porosity defined by ice. Coupling the aforementioned porosity patterns with two different fibrillogenesis routes results in a new family of materials whose textural features and the supramolecular arrangement of type I collagen are achieved. The resulting materials present hierarchical elastic properties and are successfully colonized by human endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells on the luminal side, and by human mesenchymal stem cells on the external side. The results reported here demonstrate the relevance of the proposed straightforward protocol, likely to be adapted for larger graft sizes, to address ever-growing clinical needs such as peripheral arterial disease or tracheal and bronchial reconstructions.\nCentimeter-scale perfusable cultured meat with densely packed, highly aligned muscle fibers via hollow fiber bioreactor\nAuthors: Nie, M.; Shima, A.; Takeuchi, S.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.555230\nThe development of in-vitro biofabrication methods for producing cultured meat based on animal cells has been advancing, but replicating the texture of traditional meat in centimeter-scale has been a challenge. To address this, a method using a hollow fiber bioreactor (HFB) has been developed. The HFB contains semipermeable hollow fibers that act as artificial circulatory systems to deliver nutrients and oxygen uniformly to the tissue, along with microfabricated anchors for inducing cell alignment. With active perfusion, the biofabricated centimeter-scale chick muscle tissue shows elevated levels of marker protein expression and sarcomere formation across the whole tissue, along with improved texture and flavor. In the future, further scaling up of this approach using industrial robots has the potential to transform not only the cultured meat industry but also the tissue engineering fields aiming for the formation of large-scale artificial organs.\nAlternating Magnetic Fields Drive Stimulation of Gene Expression via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species\nAuthors: Mundell, J.; Brier, M.; Orloff, E.; Stanley, S. A.; Dordick, J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555804\nMagnetogenetics represents a method for remote control of cellular function. Despite successful use of magnetic fields to control gene expression in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying magnetogenetics is largely unknown, thereby hindering further development and applications. Previous work suggests a chemical-based mechanism involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a platform initiator and downstream signaling molecule. Herein, a chemical biology approach was used to elucidate further the mechanism of radio frequency-alternating magnetic field (RF-AMF) stimulation of a TRPV1-ferritin magnetogenetics platform that leads to Ca2+ gating. RF-AMF stimulation of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPV1-Ferritin resulted in a [~]30% and [~]140% increase in intra- and extracellular ROS levels, respectively. Mutations to specific cysteine residues in TRPV1 responsible for ROS sensitivity eliminated RF-AMF driven Ca2+-dependent transcription of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Using a non-tethered (to TRPV1) ferritin also eliminated RF-AMF driven SEAP production. These results suggest ferritin-dependent ROS activation of TRPV1 plays a key role in the initiation of magnetogenetics. Furthermore, inhibition of IP3R-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release with Xestospongin C, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with Go 6983, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1/2 gp91phoxcytochrome with GSK 2795039 eliminated short-term RF-AMF potentiation of SEAP production with capsaicin. Similarly, Go 6983 significantly reduced long-term RF-AMF capsaicin potentiation of SEAP production. These results suggest that ROS-activated TRPV1 signaling to increase intracellular Ca2+ includes pathways involving PKC, NOX, and the ER. Together, these findings fill in current knowledge gaps in the mechanism of magnetogenetics, which may lead to translational applications in medicine and biotechnology.\nA Linkable, Polycarbonate Gut Microbiome-Distal Tumor Chip Platform for Interrogating Cancer Promoting Mechanisms\nAuthors: Brasino, D. S.; Speese, S. D.; Schilling, K.; Schutt, C. E.; Barton, M. C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555803\nGut microbiome composition has been tied to diseases ranging from arthritis to cancer to depression. However, mechanisms of action are poorly understood, limiting development of relevant therapeutics. Organ-on-chip platforms, which model minimal functional units of tissues and can tightly control communication between them, are ideal platforms to study these relationships. Many gut microbiome models have been published to date but devices are typically fabricated using oxygen permeable PDMS, requiring interventions to support anaerobic bacteria. To address this challenge, a novel platform was developed where the chips were fabricated entirely from gas-impermeable polycarbonate without tapes or gaskets. These chips replicated polarized villus-like structures of the native tissue. Further, they enabled co-cultures of commensal anaerobic bacteria Blautia coccoides on the surface of gut epithelia for two days within a standard incubator. Another complication of PDMS devices is high ad-/absorption, limiting applications in high-resolution microscopy and biomolecule interaction studies. For future communication studies between gut microbiota and distal tumors, an additional polycarbonate chip design was developed to support hydrogel-embedded tissue culture. These chips enable high-resolution microscopy with all relevant processing done on-chip. Designed for facile linking, this platform will make a variety of mechanistic studies possible.\nVersatile Tissue-Injectable Hydrogels with Extended Hydrolytic Release of Bioactive Protein Therapeutics\nAuthors: Nealy, E. S.; Reed, S. J.; Badeau, B. A.; Adelmund, S. M.; Shadish, J. A.; Pakiam, F. J.; Girard, E. J.; Price, J. P.; Mhyre, A. J.; Kalia, V.; Sarkar, S.; DeForest, C. A.; Olson, J. M.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.554391\nHydrogels generally have broad utilization in healthcare due to their tunable structures, high water content, and inherent biocompatibility. FDA-approved applications of hydrogels include spinal cord regeneration, skin fillers, and local therapeutic delivery. Drawbacks exist in the clinical hydrogel space, largely pertaining to inconsistent therapeutic exposure, short-lived release windows, and difficulties inserting the polymer into tissue. In this study, we engineered injectable, biocompatible hydrogels that function as a local protein therapeutic depot with a high degree of user-customizability. We showcase a PEG-based hydrogel functionalized with bioorthogonal strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) handles for its polymerization and functionalization with a variety of payloads. Small-molecule and protein cargos, including chemokines and antibodies, were site-specifically modified with hydrolysable azidoesters of varying hydrophobicity via direct chemical conjugation or sortase-mediated transpeptidation. These hydrolysable esters afforded extended releases of payloads linked to our hydrogels, with timescales spanning days to months dependent on ester hydrophobicity. Injected hydrogels polymerize in situ and remain in tissue over extended periods of time. Hydrogel-delivered protein payloads elicit biological activity after being modified with SPAAC-compatible linkers, as demonstrated by the successful recruitment of murine T-cells to a mouse melanoma model by hydrolytically released murine CXCL10. These results highlight a highly versatile, customizable hydrogel-based delivery system for local delivery of protein therapeutics with payload release profiles appropriate for a variety of clinical needs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Early atherosclerotic lesions often develop in arterial bifurcations and curvatures that experience complex disturbed flows. Lab-on-chip devices primarily adopt laminar unidirectional and oscillatory flows to characterize endothelial mechanobiology and test therapeutics. Such flows do not reproduce the time-varying, bidirectional, and complicated shear patterns on arterial walls. We fabricated an endothelium-on-chip device and developed a semi-analytical model to produce any prescribed wall shear pattern characterized by a shear rosette. We quantified responses of Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) monolayers subjected to unidirectional laminar (Uni-L) and oscillatory (Uni-O) flows in straight microfluidic channels, and a circular shear rosette (Bi-O), defined by bidirectional oscillatory flows, in the new device. Immunofluorescence results show well-defined stress fibers and VE-cadherin under laminar flows. Cells were more cuboidal with significantly larger nuclear areas in the device as compared to other groups. Lamin A/C disruption and heterochromatin reorganization were evident in nuclei of cells in the Bi-O group but were absent in the Uni-L and No-flow control groups. Cells showed significantly elevated actin, VE-cadherin, inflammatory NF-kB, and lamin expressions in the device compared to other groups. A device to create controlled disturbed flows offers a platform to assess mechanobiology, has significant potential in personalized medicine, and reduces reliance on animal trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a routine method to non-invasively quantify perfusion dynamics in tissues. The standard practice for analyzing DCE-MRI data is to fit an ordinary differential equation to each voxel. Recent advances in data science provide an opportunity to move beyond existing methods to obtain more accurate measurements of fluid properties. Here we present localized convolutional function regression, simultaneously measuring interstitial fluid velocity, diffusion, and perfusion in 3D. We validate the method computationally and experimentally, demonstrating accurate measurement of fluid dynamics in situ and in vivo. Applying the method to human MRIs, we observe tissue-specific differences in fluid dynamics, with an increased fluid velocity in breast cancer as compared to brain cancer.

One-Sentence SummaryA physics-informed computational method enables accurate and efficient measurement of fluid dynamics in individual patient tumors and demonstrates differences between tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Drug-resistant bacteria are outpacing traditional antibiotic discovery efforts. Here, we computationally mined 444,054 families of putative small proteins from 1,773 human gut metagenomes, identifying 323 peptide antibiotics encoded in small open reading frames (smORFs). To test our computational predictions, 78 peptides were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity in vitro, with 59% displaying activity against either pathogens or commensals. Since these peptides were unique compared to previously reported antimicrobial peptides, we termed them smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs). SEPs killed bacteria by targeting their membrane, synergized with each other, and modulated gut commensals, indicating that they may play a role in reconfiguring microbiome communities in addition to counteracting pathogens. The lead candidates were anti-infective in both murine skin abscess and deep thigh infection models. Notably, prevotellin-2 from Prevotella copri presented activity comparable to the commonly used antibiotic polymyxin B. We report the discovery of hundreds of peptide sequences in the human gut.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing scarcity of organs and the significant morbidity linked to dialysis requires the development of engineered kidney tissues from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. To accomplish this, integrative approaches that synergize scalable kidney organoid differentiation, tissue biomanufacturing, and comprehensive assessment of their immune response and host integration are essential. Here, we create engineered human kidney tissues composed of kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) and transplant them into mice reconstituted with allogeneic human immune cells. We assess their host vascular integration, in vivo maturation, and their ability to trigger human immune responses. Tissue-infiltrating human immune cells are composed of effector T cells and innate cells. This immune infiltration leads to kidney tissue injury characterized by reduced microvasculature, enhanced kidney cell apoptosis, and a unique inflammatory gene signature comparable to kidney organ transplant rejection in humans. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressive agent Rapamycin, the induced immune response is greatly suppressed. Our model serves as a translational platform to study engineered kidney tissue immunogenicity and develop novel therapeutic targets for kidney rejection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present a simple low-cost system for comprehensive functional characterization of cardiac function under spontaneous and paced conditions, in standard 96 and 384-well plates. This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium from all wells in parallel. The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 394-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated deployment of optogenetic cell spheroids for point pacing to study conduction in 96-well format, and the use of temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera in this stand-alone platform. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates, in the various configurations. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic tubular grafts currently used in clinical context fail frequently, and the expectations that biomimetic materials could tackle these limitations are high. However, developing tubular materials presenting structural, compositional and functional properties close to those of native tissues remains an unmet challenge. Here we describe a combination of ice templating and topotactic fibrillogenesis of type I collagen, the main component of tissues&#39; extracellular matrix, yielding highly concentrated yet porous tubular collagen materials with controlled hierarchical architecture at multiple length scales, the hallmark of native tissues&#39; organization. By modulating the thermal conductivity of the cylindrical molds, we tune the macroscopic porosity defined by ice. Coupling the aforementioned porosity patterns with two different fibrillogenesis routes results in a new family of materials whose textural features and the supramolecular arrangement of type I collagen are achieved. The resulting materials present hierarchical elastic properties and are successfully colonized by human endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells on the luminal side, and by human mesenchymal stem cells on the external side. The results reported here demonstrate the relevance of the proposed straightforward protocol, likely to be adapted for larger graft sizes, to address ever-growing clinical needs such as peripheral arterial disease or tracheal and bronchial reconstructions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development of in-vitro biofabrication methods for producing cultured meat based on animal cells has been advancing, but replicating the texture of traditional meat in centimeter-scale has been a challenge. To address this, a method using a hollow fiber bioreactor (HFB) has been developed. The HFB contains semipermeable hollow fibers that act as artificial circulatory systems to deliver nutrients and oxygen uniformly to the tissue, along with microfabricated anchors for inducing cell alignment. With active perfusion, the biofabricated centimeter-scale chick muscle tissue shows elevated levels of marker protein expression and sarcomere formation across the whole tissue, along with improved texture and flavor. In the future, further scaling up of this approach using industrial robots has the potential to transform not only the cultured meat industry but also the tissue engineering fields aiming for the formation of large-scale artificial organs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Magnetogenetics represents a method for remote control of cellular function. Despite successful use of magnetic fields to control gene expression in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying magnetogenetics is largely unknown, thereby hindering further development and applications. Previous work suggests a chemical-based mechanism involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a platform initiator and downstream signaling molecule. Herein, a chemical biology approach was used to elucidate further the mechanism of radio frequency-alternating magnetic field (RF-AMF) stimulation of a TRPV1-ferritin magnetogenetics platform that leads to Ca2&#43; gating. RF-AMF stimulation of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPV1-Ferritin resulted in a [~]30% and [~]140% increase in intra- and extracellular ROS levels, respectively. Mutations to specific cysteine residues in TRPV1 responsible for ROS sensitivity eliminated RF-AMF driven Ca2&#43;-dependent transcription of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Using a non-tethered (to TRPV1) ferritin also eliminated RF-AMF driven SEAP production. These results suggest ferritin-dependent ROS activation of TRPV1 plays a key role in the initiation of magnetogenetics. Furthermore, inhibition of IP3R-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2&#43; release with Xestospongin C, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with Go 6983, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1/2 gp91phoxcytochrome with GSK 2795039 eliminated short-term RF-AMF potentiation of SEAP production with capsaicin. Similarly, Go 6983 significantly reduced long-term RF-AMF capsaicin potentiation of SEAP production. These results suggest that ROS-activated TRPV1 signaling to increase intracellular Ca2&#43; includes pathways involving PKC, NOX, and the ER. Together, these findings fill in current knowledge gaps in the mechanism of magnetogenetics, which may lead to translational applications in medicine and biotechnology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gut microbiome composition has been tied to diseases ranging from arthritis to cancer to depression. However, mechanisms of action are poorly understood, limiting development of relevant therapeutics. Organ-on-chip platforms, which model minimal functional units of tissues and can tightly control communication between them, are ideal platforms to study these relationships. Many gut microbiome models have been published to date but devices are typically fabricated using oxygen permeable PDMS, requiring interventions to support anaerobic bacteria. To address this challenge, a novel platform was developed where the chips were fabricated entirely from gas-impermeable polycarbonate without tapes or gaskets. These chips replicated polarized villus-like structures of the native tissue. Further, they enabled co-cultures of commensal anaerobic bacteria Blautia coccoides on the surface of gut epithelia for two days within a standard incubator. Another complication of PDMS devices is high ad-/absorption, limiting applications in high-resolution microscopy and biomolecule interaction studies. For future communication studies between gut microbiota and distal tumors, an additional polycarbonate chip design was developed to support hydrogel-embedded tissue culture. These chips enable high-resolution microscopy with all relevant processing done on-chip. Designed for facile linking, this platform will make a variety of mechanistic studies possible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hydrogels generally have broad utilization in healthcare due to their tunable structures, high water content, and inherent biocompatibility. FDA-approved applications of hydrogels include spinal cord regeneration, skin fillers, and local therapeutic delivery. Drawbacks exist in the clinical hydrogel space, largely pertaining to inconsistent therapeutic exposure, short-lived release windows, and difficulties inserting the polymer into tissue. In this study, we engineered injectable, biocompatible hydrogels that function as a local protein therapeutic depot with a high degree of user-customizability. We showcase a PEG-based hydrogel functionalized with bioorthogonal strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) handles for its polymerization and functionalization with a variety of payloads. Small-molecule and protein cargos, including chemokines and antibodies, were site-specifically modified with hydrolysable azidoesters of varying hydrophobicity via direct chemical conjugation or sortase-mediated transpeptidation. These hydrolysable esters afforded extended releases of payloads linked to our hydrogels, with timescales spanning days to months dependent on ester hydrophobicity. Injected hydrogels polymerize in situ and remain in tissue over extended periods of time. Hydrogel-delivered protein payloads elicit biological activity after being modified with SPAAC-compatible linkers, as demonstrated by the successful recruitment of murine T-cells to a mouse melanoma model by hydrolytically released murine CXCL10. These results highlight a highly versatile, customizable hydrogel-based delivery system for local delivery of protein therapeutics with payload release profiles appropriate for a variety of clinical needs.</p>
