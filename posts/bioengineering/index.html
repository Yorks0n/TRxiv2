O.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562069\nThe brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cell activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-resolved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.\nBioengineered human colon organoids with in vivo-like complexity and function\nAuthors: Mitrofanova, O.; Broguiere, N.; Nikolaev, M.; Lutolf, M. P.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560991\nOrganoids and microphysiological systems, such as organs-on-a-chip, have emerged as powerful tools for modeling human gut physiology and disease in vitro. However, although physiologically relevant, these systems often lack the environmental milieu, spatial organization, cell-type diversity, and maturity necessary for mimicking adult human intestinal mucosa. To instead generate models closely resembling the in vivo cell-type composition and spatial compartmentalization, we herein integrated organoid and organ-on-a-chip technology to develop a primary human stem-cell-derived organoid model, called mini-colons. The luminal access and flow in human mini-colons removes shed cells to greatly enhance tissue longevity and differentiation over physically inaccessible human intestinal organoids that accumulate trapped cellular debris and waste. By establishing a gradient of growth factors, we replicated and sustained in vivo-like cell fate patterning and concurrent differentiation to secretory cell types and colonocytes. These long-lived human mini-colons contain abundant mucus-producing Goblet cells that lubricate the colonic epithelial lining. The stem and proliferative progenitor cells are also realistically confined to the crypts, facilitating stable homeostatic tissue turnover and preserving tissue integrity for several weeks. Also signifying mini-colon in vivo-like maturation, single-cell RNA sequencing showed emerging mature colonocytes and absorptive BEST4+ colonocytes. This methodology could be expanded to generate microtissues derived from the small intestine and incorporate additional microenvironmental components, thus emulating the intricate complexity of the native gut in an in vitro setting. Our bioengineered human organoids provide a highly accurate, long-lived, functional platform to systematically study human gut physiology and pathology, and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.\nRemotely controlled drug release in deep brain regionsof non-human primates\nAuthors: Wilson, M. G.; Webb, T. D.; Odeen, H.; Kubanek, J.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561539\nMany areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound--remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy--may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.

E.; Jordan, J. H.; Thomas, A.; Friday, S. R.; Melendez, G. C.; Weis, J. A.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561881\nBackground: There is considerable focus on developing strategies for identifying subclinical cardiac decline prior to cardiac failure. Myocardial tissue elasticity changes may precede irreversible cardiac damage, providing promise for an early biomarker for cardiac decline. Biomarker strategies are of particular interest in cardio-oncology due to cardiotoxic effects of anti-neoplastic therapies, particularly anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics. Current clinical methods for diagnosing cardiotoxicity are too coarse to identify cardiac decline early enough for meaningful therapeutic intervention, or too cumbersome for clinical implementation. Methods: Utilizing changes in myocardial elasticity as a biomarker for subclinical cardiac decline, we developed a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to estimate spatial maps of left ventricle (LV) myocardial elasticity. In this study, we employ this methodology to assess changes in LV elasticity in a non-human primate model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of five African Green monkeys was acquired at baseline prior to doxorubicin administration, 6-weeks, and 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose and histopathological samples of the LV were taken at 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose. Spatial elasticity maps of the mid-short axis plane of the LV were estimated at each image acquisition. Global and regional LV elasticity were calculated and changes between imaging time points was assessed. LV elasticity at baseline and final time point were compared to cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements calculated from histopathological staining of archived tissue bank samples and study endpoint tissue samples utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results: We identify significant changes in LV elasticity between each imaging time point both globally and regionally. We also demonstrate strong correlation between LV elasticity and cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements. Results indicate that LV elasticity estimates calculated using BEIM correlate with histopathological changes that occur due to doxorubicin administration, validating LV elasticity solutions and providing significant promise for use of BEIM to non-invasively elucidate cardiac injury. Conclusions: This methodology can show progressive changes in LV elasticity and has potential to be a more sensitive indicator of elasticity changes than current clinical measures of cardiotoxicity. LV elasticity may provide a valuable biomarker for cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics and cardiac disease detection.\nBiocomposite Thermoplastic Polyurethanes Containing Evolved Bacterial Spores as Living Fillers to Facilitate Polymer Disintegration\nAuthors: Kim, H.

K.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561602\nThe field of engineered living materials (ELMs) seeks to pair living organisms with synthetic materials to generate biocomposite materials with augmented function since living systems can provide highly-programmable and complex behavior. ELMs have typically been fabricated using techniques in benign aqueous environments, limiting their application. In this work, biocomposite fabrication was demonstrated in which spores from polymer-degrading bacteria were incorporated into a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) using high-temperature melt processing. Bacteria were engineered using adaptive laboratory evolution to improve their heat tolerance to ensure nearly complete cell survivability during manufacturing at 135 {degrees}C. Furthermore, the overall tensile properties of spore-filled TPUs were substantially improved, resulting in a significant improvement in toughness. The biocomposites facilitated disintegration in compost in the absence of a microbe-rich environment. Finally, spores retained a programmed function, expressing green fluorescent protein. This research provides a scalable method to fabricate advanced biocomposite materials in industrially-compatible processes.\nMechanical Properties of Native and Decellularized Reproductive Tissues: Insights for Tissue Engineering Strategies\nAuthors: Franko, R.; Franko, Y.; Martinez, E. R.; Ferronato, G.; Heinzelmann, I.; Grechi, N.; Devkota, S.; Fontes, P. K.; Coeti, R.; Oshiro, T. S. I.; Ferraz, M. d. A. M. M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561536\nUnderstanding the mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues is vital for regenerative medicine in tissue engineering. This study investigated the changes in Youngs modulus (YM), storage modulus (E'), loss modulus (E''), and porosity of native and decellularized bovine reproductive tissues during the estrous cycle. Testis tunica albuginea had significantly higher YM, E', and E'' than the inner testis, indicating greater stiffness and viscoelasticity. Endometrium showed no distinct differences in YM, E', or E' across the estrous cycle or between horns. Ovaries exhibited significant variations in YM, E', E'', and porosity, with higher YM and E' in the ipsilateral cortex and medulla during the luteal phase. Decellularized ovarian tissues displayed increased porosity. The oviduct displayed no significant differences in YM or E' in the isthmus, but the contralateral ampulla had reduced YM and E' in the luteal phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues, facilitating the development of biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.\nUsing a micro-device with a deformable ceiling to probe stiffness heterogeneities within 3D cell aggregates\nAuthors: Jain, S.; Belkadi, H.; Michaut, A.; Sart, S.; Gros, J.; Genet, M.; Baroud, C. N.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.559477\nRecent advances in the field of mechanobiology have led to the development of methods to characterize single-cell or monolayer mechanical properties and link them to their functional behaviour. However, there remains a strong need to establish this link for three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, which better mimic tissue function. Here we present a platform to actuate and observe many such aggregates within one deformable micro-device. The platform consists of a single PDMS piece cast on a 3D-printed mold and bonded to a glass slide or coverslip. It consists of a chamber containing cell spheroids, which is adjacent to air cavities that are fluidically independent. Controlling the air pressure in these air cavities leads to a vertical displacement of the chambers ceiling. The device can be used in static or dynamic modes over time-scales of seconds to hours, with displacement amplitudes from a few m to several tens of microns. Further, we show how the compression protocols can be used to obtain measurements of stiffness heterogeneities within individual co-culture spheroids, by comparing image correlations of spheroids at different levels of compression with finite element simulations. The labeling of the cells and their cytoskeleton is combined with image correlation methods to relate the structure of the co-culture spheroid with its mechanical properties at different locations. The device is compatible with various microscopy techniques, including confocal microscopy, which can be used to observe the displacements and rearrangements of single cells and neighborhoods within the aggregate. The complete experimental and imaging platform can now be used to provide multi-scale measurements that link single-cell behavior with the global mechanical response of the aggregates.\nBiodesign of Frugal CRISPR Kits for Equitable and Accessible Education\nAuthors: Collin, M. C.; Lau, M.; Ma, W.; Shen, A.; La Russa, M.; Qi, L. S.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562372\nEquitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kit's utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.\nMolecular de-extinction of antibiotics enabled by deep learning\nAuthors: Wan, F.; Torres, M. D. T.; Peng, J.; de la Fuente, C.\nScore: 87.8, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560353\nMolecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the \"extinctome\") searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.\nOsteochondral fluid transport in an ex vivo system\nAuthors: Hislop, B. D.; Mercer, A. K.; Whitley, A. G.; Meyers, E. P.; Heveran, C. M.; June, R. K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562188\nObjective: Alterations to fluid transport from bone-to-cartilage may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. However, many questions remain about fluid transport between these tissues. The objectives of this study were to (1) test for diffusion of 3kDa molecular tracers from bone-to-cartilage and (2) assess potential differences in bone-to-cartilage fluid transport between different loading conditions. Design: Osteochondral cores extracted from bovine femurs (N=8 femurs, 10 cores/femur) were subjected to either no-load (i.e., pure diffusion), pre-load only, or cyclic compression (5+/-2% or 10+/-2% strain) in a two-chamber transport system with the bone compartment filled with a 3kDa tracer. Tracer concentrations in the cartilage compartment were measured every 5 minutes for 120 minutes. Tracer concentrations were analyzed for differences in beginning, peak and equilibrium concentrations, loading effects, and time-to-peak tracer concentration. Results: Peak tracer concentration in the cartilage compartment was significantly higher compared to beginning and equilibrium tracer concentrations indicating fluid transport from bone to cartilage. Cartilage-compartment tracer concentration was influenced by strain magnitude, but no time-to-peak relationship was found when comparing strain magnitudes. Conclusion: This study shows that osteochondral fluid transport occurs from bone-to-cartilage with 3kDa dextran molecules. These are much larger molecules to move between bone and cartilage than previously reported. Further these results demonstrate the potential for cyclic compression to impact osteochondral fluid transport. Determining the baseline osteochondral fluid transport in healthy tissues is crucial to elucidating the potential mechanisms of progression and onset of osteoarthritis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cell activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-resolved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids and microphysiological systems, such as organs-on-a-chip, have emerged as powerful tools for modeling human gut physiology and disease in vitro. However, although physiologically relevant, these systems often lack the environmental milieu, spatial organization, cell-type diversity, and maturity necessary for mimicking adult human intestinal mucosa. To instead generate models closely resembling the in vivo cell-type composition and spatial compartmentalization, we herein integrated organoid and organ-on-a-chip technology to develop a primary human stem-cell-derived organoid model, called  mini-colons. The luminal access and flow in human mini-colons removes shed cells to greatly enhance tissue longevity and differentiation over physically inaccessible human intestinal organoids that accumulate trapped cellular debris and waste. By establishing a gradient of growth factors, we replicated and sustained in vivo-like cell fate patterning and concurrent differentiation to secretory cell types and colonocytes. These long-lived human mini-colons contain abundant mucus-producing Goblet cells that lubricate the colonic epithelial lining. The stem and proliferative progenitor cells are also realistically confined to the crypts, facilitating stable homeostatic tissue turnover and preserving tissue integrity for several weeks. Also signifying mini-colon in vivo-like maturation, single-cell RNA sequencing showed emerging mature colonocytes and absorptive BEST4&#43; colonocytes. This methodology could be expanded to generate microtissues derived from the small intestine and incorporate additional microenvironmental components, thus emulating the intricate complexity of the native gut in an in vitro setting. Our bioengineered human organoids provide a highly accurate, long-lived, functional platform to systematically study human gut physiology and pathology, and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many areas of science and medicine would benefit from selective release of drugs in specific regions of interest. Nanoparticle drug carriers activated by focused ultrasound--remotely applied, depth-penetrating energy--may provide such selective interventions. Here, we developed stable, ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles that can be used to release drugs effectively and safely in non-human primates. The nanoparticles were used to release propofol in deep brain visual regions. The release reversibly modulated the subjects visual choice behavior and was specific to the targeted region and to the released drug. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging suggested an intact blood-brain barrier. Blood draws showed normal clinical chemistry and hematology. In summary, this study provides a safe and effective approach to release drugs on demand in selected deep brain regions at levels sufficient to modulate behavior.

        <p class="abstract">Background: There is considerable focus on developing strategies for identifying subclinical cardiac decline prior to cardiac failure. Myocardial tissue elasticity changes may precede irreversible cardiac damage, providing promise for an early biomarker for cardiac decline. Biomarker strategies are of particular interest in cardio-oncology due to cardiotoxic effects of anti-neoplastic therapies, particularly anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics. Current clinical methods for diagnosing cardiotoxicity are too coarse to identify cardiac decline early enough for meaningful therapeutic intervention, or too cumbersome for clinical implementation. Methods: Utilizing changes in myocardial elasticity as a biomarker for subclinical cardiac decline, we developed a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to estimate spatial maps of left ventricle (LV) myocardial elasticity. In this study, we employ this methodology to assess changes in LV elasticity in a non-human primate model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of five African Green monkeys was acquired at baseline prior to doxorubicin administration, 6-weeks, and 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose and histopathological samples of the LV were taken at 15-weeks after final doxorubicin dose. Spatial elasticity maps of the mid-short axis plane of the LV were estimated at each image acquisition. Global and regional LV elasticity were calculated and changes between imaging time points was assessed. LV elasticity at baseline and final time point were compared to cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements calculated from histopathological staining of archived tissue bank samples and study endpoint tissue samples utilizing Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficients. Results: We identify significant changes in LV elasticity between each imaging time point both globally and regionally. We also demonstrate strong correlation between LV elasticity and cardiomyocyte size and collagen volume fraction measurements. Results indicate that LV elasticity estimates calculated using BEIM correlate with histopathological changes that occur due to doxorubicin administration, validating LV elasticity solutions and providing significant promise for use of BEIM to non-invasively elucidate cardiac injury. Conclusions: This methodology can show progressive changes in LV elasticity and has potential to be a more sensitive indicator of elasticity changes than current clinical measures of cardiotoxicity. LV elasticity may provide a valuable biomarker for cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics and cardiac disease detection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The field of engineered living materials (ELMs) seeks to pair living organisms with synthetic materials to generate biocomposite materials with augmented function since living systems can provide highly-programmable and complex behavior. ELMs have typically been fabricated using techniques in benign aqueous environments, limiting their application. In this work, biocomposite fabrication was demonstrated in which spores from polymer-degrading bacteria were incorporated into a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) using high-temperature melt processing. Bacteria were engineered using adaptive laboratory evolution to improve their heat tolerance to ensure nearly complete cell survivability during manufacturing at 135 {degrees}C. Furthermore, the overall tensile properties of spore-filled TPUs were substantially improved, resulting in a significant improvement in toughness. The biocomposites facilitated disintegration in compost in the absence of a microbe-rich environment. Finally, spores retained a programmed function, expressing green fluorescent protein. This research provides a scalable method to fabricate advanced biocomposite materials in industrially-compatible processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues is vital for regenerative medicine in tissue engineering. This study investigated the changes in Youngs modulus (YM), storage modulus (E&#39;), loss modulus (E&#39;&#39;), and porosity of native and decellularized bovine reproductive tissues during the estrous cycle. Testis tunica albuginea had significantly higher YM, E&#39;, and E&#39;&#39; than the inner testis, indicating greater stiffness and viscoelasticity. Endometrium showed no distinct differences in YM, E&#39;, or E&#39; across the estrous cycle or between horns. Ovaries exhibited significant variations in YM, E&#39;, E&#39;&#39;, and porosity, with higher YM and E&#39; in the ipsilateral cortex and medulla during the luteal phase. Decellularized ovarian tissues displayed increased porosity. The oviduct displayed no significant differences in YM or E&#39; in the isthmus, but the contralateral ampulla had reduced YM and E&#39; in the luteal phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic mechanical properties and porosity of reproductive tissues, facilitating the development of biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in the field of mechanobiology have led to the development of methods to characterize single-cell or monolayer mechanical properties and link them to their functional behaviour. However, there remains a strong need to establish this link for three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, which better mimic tissue function. Here we present a platform to actuate and observe many such aggregates within one deformable micro-device. The platform consists of a single PDMS piece cast on a 3D-printed mold and bonded to a glass slide or coverslip. It consists of a chamber containing cell spheroids, which is adjacent to air cavities that are fluidically independent. Controlling the air pressure in these air cavities leads to a vertical displacement of the chambers ceiling. The device can be used in static or dynamic modes over time-scales of seconds to hours, with displacement amplitudes from a few m to several tens of microns. Further, we show how the compression protocols can be used to obtain measurements of stiffness heterogeneities within individual co-culture spheroids, by comparing image correlations of spheroids at different levels of compression with finite element simulations. The labeling of the cells and their cytoskeleton is combined with image correlation methods to relate the structure of the co-culture spheroid with its mechanical properties at different locations. The device is compatible with various microscopy techniques, including confocal microscopy, which can be used to observe the displacements and rearrangements of single cells and neighborhoods within the aggregate. The complete experimental and imaging platform can now be used to provide multi-scale measurements that link single-cell behavior with the global mechanical response of the aggregates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Equitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kit&#39;s utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the &#34;extinctome&#34;) searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Alterations to fluid transport from bone-to-cartilage may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. However, many questions remain about fluid transport between these tissues. The objectives of this study were to (1) test for diffusion of 3kDa molecular tracers from bone-to-cartilage and (2) assess potential differences in bone-to-cartilage fluid transport between different loading conditions. Design: Osteochondral cores extracted from bovine femurs (N=8 femurs, 10 cores/femur) were subjected to either no-load (i.e., pure diffusion), pre-load only, or cyclic compression (5&#43;/-2% or 10&#43;/-2% strain) in a two-chamber transport system with the bone compartment filled with a 3kDa tracer. Tracer concentrations in the cartilage compartment were measured every 5 minutes for 120 minutes. Tracer concentrations were analyzed for differences in beginning, peak and equilibrium concentrations, loading effects, and time-to-peak tracer concentration. Results: Peak tracer concentration in the cartilage compartment was significantly higher compared to beginning and equilibrium tracer concentrations indicating fluid transport from bone to cartilage. Cartilage-compartment tracer concentration was influenced by strain magnitude, but no time-to-peak relationship was found when comparing strain magnitudes. Conclusion: This study shows that osteochondral fluid transport occurs from bone-to-cartilage with 3kDa dextran molecules. These are much larger molecules to move between bone and cartilage than previously reported. Further these results demonstrate the potential for cyclic compression to impact osteochondral fluid transport. Determining the baseline osteochondral fluid transport in healthy tissues is crucial to elucidating the potential mechanisms of progression and onset of osteoarthritis.</p>
