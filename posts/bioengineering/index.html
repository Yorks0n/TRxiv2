B.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.544557\n3D-bioprinting is a promising technology to produce human tissues as drug screening tool or for organ repair. However, direct printing of living cells has proven difficult. Here, we present a method to directly 3D-bioprint human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes embedded in a collagen-hyaluronic acid ink generating centimeter-sized functional ring- and ventricle-shaped cardiac tissues in an accurate and reproducible manner. The printed tissues contained hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with well-organized sarcomeres and exhibited spontaneous and regular contractions, which persisted for several months and were able to contract against passive resistance. Importantly, beating frequencies of the printed cardiac tissues could be modulated by pharmacological stimulation. This approach opens up new possibilities for generating complex functional cardiac tissues as models for advanced drug screening or as tissue grafts for organ repair or replacement.\nSpatiotemporal Control of Genomics and Epigenomics by Ultrasound\nAuthors: Wu, Y.; Huang, Z.; Liu, Y.; Yoon, C.-W.; Sun, K.; Situ, Y.; Ho, P.; Yuan, Z.; Zhu, L.; Eyquem, J.; Zhao, Y.; Liu, T.; Kwong, G. A.; Chien, S.; Wang, Y.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.544125\nCRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a revolutionary technology for genome editing. Its derived technologies such as CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) further allow transcriptional and epigenetic modulations. Focused ultrasound (FUS) can penetrate deep in biological tissues and induce mild hyperthermia in a confined region to activate heat-sensitive genes. Here we engineer a set of CRISPR(a/i) tools containing heat-sensitive genetic modules controllable by FUS for the regulation of genome and epigenome in live cells and animals. We demonstrated the capabilities of FUS-inducible CRISPRa, CRISPRi, and CRISPR (FUS-CRISPR(a/i)) to upregulate, repress, and knockout exogenous and/or endogenous genes, respectively, in different cell types. We further targeted FUS-CRISPR to telomeres in tumor cells to induce telomere disruption, inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing tumor susceptibility to killing by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. FUS-CRISPR-mediated telomere disruption for tumor priming combined with CAR-T therapy demonstrated synergistic therapeutic effects in xenograft mouse models. The FUS-CRISPR(a/i) toolbox allows the remote, noninvasive, and spatiotemporal control of genomic and epigenomic reprogramming in vivo, with extended applications in cancer treatment.\nHierarchical design of pseudosymmetric protein nanoparticles\nAuthors: Dowling, Q.; Park, Y.-J.; Gerstenmaier, N.; Yang, E.; Wargacki, A.; Hsia, Y.; Fries, C.; Ravichandran, R.; Walkey, C.; Burrell, A.; Veesler, D.; Baker, D.; King, N.\nScore: 46.5, Published: 2023-06-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545393\nDiscrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions 1-3. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry 4,5. Inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540, and 960 subunits. At 49, 71, and 96 nm diameter, these nanoparticles are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work represents an important step towards the accurate design of arbitrary self-assembling nanoscale protein objects.\nMagnetogenetic cell activation using endogenous ferritin\nAuthors: Stanley, S. A.; Pomeranz, L. E.; Li, R.; Yu, X. A.; Kelly, L.; Hassanzadeh, G.; Molina, H.; Gross, D.; Brier, M. I.; Vaisey, G.; Jimenez-Gonzalez, M.; Garcia-Ocana, A.; Dordick, J.; Friedman, J. M.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545120\nThe ability to precisely control the activity of defined cell populations enables studies of their physiological roles and may provide therapeutic applications. While prior studies have shown that magnetic activation of ferritin-tagged ion channels allows cell-specific modulation of cellular activity, the large size of the constructs made the use of adeno-associated virus, AAV, the vector of choice for gene therapy, impractical. In addition, simple means for generating magnetic fields of sufficient strength have been lacking. Toward these ends, we first generated a novel anti-ferritin nanobody that when fused to transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1, TRPV1, enables direct binding of the channel to endogenous ferritin in mouse and human cells. This smaller construct can be delivered in a single AAV and we validated that it robustly enables magnetically induced cell activation in vitro. In parallel, we developed a simple benchtop electromagnet capable of gating the nanobody-tagged channel in vivo. Finally, we showed that delivering these new constructs by AAV to pancreatic beta cells in combination with the benchtop magnetic field delivery stimulates glucose-stimulated insulin release to improve glucose tolerance in mice in vivo. Together, the novel anti-ferritin nanobody, nanobody-TRPV1 construct and new hardware advance the utility of magnetogenetics in animals and potentially humans.\nHigh-Resolution Additive Manufacturing of a Biodegradable Elastomer with a Low-Cost LCD 3D Printer\nAuthors: Karamzadeh, V.; Shen, M.; Ravanbakhsh, H.; Kashani, A. S.; Savoji, H.; Radisic, M.; Juncker, D.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545079\nArtificial organs and organs-on-a-chip are of great clinical and scientific interest and have recently been made by additive manufacturing, but depend on, and benefit from, biocompatible, biodegradable, and soft materials. Poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) citrate (POMaC) meets these criteria and has gained popularity, and as in principle, it can be photocured and is amenable to vat-photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing, but only low-resolution structures have been produced so fa. Here, we introduce a VP-POMaC ink and demonstrate 3D printing of high resolution (80 {micro}m) and complex 3D structures using low-cost ([~]US$300) liquid-crystal display (LCD) printers. The ink includes POMaC, a diluent and porogen additive to reduce viscosity within the range of VP, and a crosslinker to speed up reaction kinetics. The mechanical properties of the cured ink were tuned to match the elastic moduli of different tissues simply by varying the porogen concentration. The biocompatibility was assessed by cell culture which yielded 80% viability and the potential for tissue engineering illustrated with a 3D printed gyroid seeded with cells. VP-POMaC and low-cost LCD printers make the additive manufacturing of high resolution, elastomeric, and biodegradable constructs widely accessible, paving the way for a myriad of applications in tissue engineering, implants, organ-on-a-chip, wearables, and soft robotics.\nDevelopment and Optimisation of in vitro Sonodynamic Therapy for Glioblastoma\nAuthors: Keenylside, A.; Marples, T.; Gao, Z.; Hu, H.; Nicely, L. G.; Nogales, J.; Li, H.; Landgraf, L.; Solth, A.; Melzer, A.; Hossain-Ibrahim, K.; Huang, Z.; Banerjee, S.; Joseph, J.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545530\nBackgroundSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is currently on critical path for glioblastoma therapeutics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic functions of SDT remain enigmatic due to the lack of intricately optimised instrumentation capable of modulating SDT delivery in vitro. We established and validated an automated in vitro SDT system and assessed its SDT efficacy. MethodsAn automated in vitro SDT system was established and validated to allow the application and mapping of focused ultrasound fields under varied acoustic exposure conditions and setup configurations. Ultrasound field simulations were performed to assess the acoustic energy exposure. Systematic in vitro investigations were performed to optimise ultrasound frequency, intensity, plate base material, thermal effect, and the integration of live cells. ResultsIn the presence of 5-ALA, focused ultrasound induces apoptotic cell death in primary patient-derived glioma cells with concurrent upregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Intriguingly, primary glioma stem neurospheres also exhibit remarkably reduced 3D growth upon SDT exposure. Further, ultrasound field simulations performed established acoustic field distribution and the impact of acoustic standing waves within the well-plates. ConclusionsThe optimised in vitro SDT system and associated ultrasound field simulations establish the basis for further understanding of SDT and its therapeutic potentials in cancer.\nRobust estimation of brain stimulation evoked responses using magnetoencephalography\nAuthors: Oswal, A.; Abdi-Sargezeh, B.; Ozkurt, T. E.; Taulu, S.; Sarangmat, N.; Green, A. L.; Litvak, V.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546459\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are often contaminated by interference that can exceed the amplitude of physiological brain activity by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, activity of interference sources may leak into the activity of brain signals of interest, resulting in source estimation inaccuracies. This problem is particularly apparent when using MEG to interrogate the effects of brain stimulation on large scale cortical networks. This technical report offers two contributions. Firstly, using phantom MEG recordings we describe an approach for validating the estimation accuracy of brain stimulation evoked responses. Secondly, we propose a novel denoising method for suppressing the leakage of stimulation related signal into recorded brain activity. This approach leverages spatial and temporal domain projectors for signal arising from prespecified anatomical regions of interest. We highlight its advantages compared to the benchmark - spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) - and show that it can more accurately reveal brain stimulation evoked responses.\nEngineered CD47 protects T cells for enhanced antitumor immunity\nAuthors: Yamada-Hunter, S. A.; Theruvath, J.; McIntosh, B. J.; Freitas, K. A.; Radosevich, M. T.; Leruste, A.; Dhingra, S.; Martinez-Velez, N.; Xu, P.; Delaidelli, A.; Desai, M. H.; Good, Z.; Labanieh, L.; Mount, C. W.; Chen, Y.; Heitzeneder, S.; Marjon, K. D.; Banuelos, A.; Khan, O.; Huang, J.; Wasserman, S. L.; Spiegel, J. Y.; Fernandez-Pol, S.; Sorensen, P. H.; Monje, M.; Majzner, R. G.; Weissman, I. L.; Sahaf, B.; Sotillo, E.; Cochran, J. R.; Mackall, C. L.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545790\nAdoptively transferred T cells and agents designed to block the CD47/SIRP axis are promising antitumor therapeutics, which activate distinct arms of the immune system. We administered anti-CD47 (CD47) with adoptively transferred T cells with the goal of enhancing antitumor efficacy but observed rapid macrophage-mediated clearance of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or engineered T cell receptors, which blunted therapeutic benefit. CD47 mediated CAR T clearance was potent and rapid enough to serve as an effective safety switch. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a CD47 variant (47E) that engaged SIRP and provided a \"dont-eat-me\" signal that was not blocked by CD47 antibodies. TCR or CAR T cells expressing 47E were resistant to clearance by macrophages following CD47, and mediated significant, sustained macrophage recruitment into the TME. Although many of the recruited macrophages manifested an M2-like profile, the combined therapy resulted in synergistic enhancement in antitumor efficacy. This work identifies macrophages as major regulators of T cell persistence and illustrates the fundamental challenge of combining T cell directed therapeutics with those designed to activate macrophages. It further delivers a therapeutic approach capable of simultaneously harnessing the antitumor effects of T cells and macrophages that manifests markedly enhanced potency against solid tumors.\nOpenSIM: open source microscope add-on for structured illumination microscopy\nAuthors: Hannebelle, M.

M.; Lasser, T.; Radenovic, A.; Mckinney, J. D.; Fantner, G. E.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545316\nSuper-resolution techniques expand the abilities of researchers who have the knowledge and resources to either build or purchase a system. This excludes the part of the research community without these capabilities. Here we introduce the openSIM add-on to upgrade existing optical microscopes to Structured Illumination super-resolution Microscopes (SIM). The openSIM is an open-hardware system, designed and documented to be easily duplicated by other laboratories, making super-resolution modality accessible to facilitate innovative research. The add-on approach gives a performance improvement for pre-existing lab equipment without the need to build a completely new system.\nIntracellular Proteomics and Extracellular Vesiculomics as a Metric of Disease Recapitulation in 3D Bioprinted Aortic Valve Arrays\nAuthors: Clift, C. L.; Blaser, M. C.; Gerrits, W.; Turner, M. E.; Sonawane, A. C.; Pham, T.; Andresen, J. L.; Fenton, O. S.; Grolman, J. M.; Buffolo, F.; Schoen, F. J.; Hjortnaes, J.; Muehlschlegel, J. D.; Mooney, D. D.; Aikawa, M.; Singh, S. A.; Langer, R.; Aikawa, E.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546103\nIn calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), mechanosensitive valvular cells respond to fibrosis- and calcification-induced tissue stiffening, further driving pathophysiology. No pharmacotherapeutics are available to treat CAVD, due to the lack of: 1) appropriate experimental models that recapitulate this complex environment; and 2) benchmarking novel engineered AV-model performance. We established a biomaterial-based CAVD model mimicking the biomechanics of the human AV disease-prone fibrosa layer, 3D-bioprinted into 96-well arrays. LC-MS/MS analyses probed the cellular proteome and vesiculome to compare the 3D-bioprinted model vs. traditional 2D monoculture, against human CAVD tissue. The 3D-bioprinted model highly recapitulated the CAVD cellular proteome (94% vs. 70% of 2D proteins). Integration of cellular/vesicular datasets identified known and novel proteins ubiquitous to AV calcification. This study explores how 2D vs. 3D-bioengineered systems recapitulate unique aspects of human disease, positions multi-omics as a novel technique for the evaluation of high throughput-based bioengineered model systems and potentiates future drug discovery.\n",

        <p class="abstract">3D-bioprinting is a promising technology to produce human tissues as drug screening tool or for organ repair. However, direct printing of living cells has proven difficult. Here, we present a method to directly 3D-bioprint human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes embedded in a collagen-hyaluronic acid ink generating centimeter-sized functional ring- and ventricle-shaped cardiac tissues in an accurate and reproducible manner. The printed tissues contained hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with well-organized sarcomeres and exhibited spontaneous and regular contractions, which persisted for several months and were able to contract against passive resistance. Importantly, beating frequencies of the printed cardiac tissues could be modulated by pharmacological stimulation. This approach opens up new possibilities for generating complex functional cardiac tissues as models for advanced drug screening or as tissue grafts for organ repair or replacement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a revolutionary technology for genome editing. Its derived technologies such as CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) further allow transcriptional and epigenetic modulations. Focused ultrasound (FUS) can penetrate deep in biological tissues and induce mild hyperthermia in a confined region to activate heat-sensitive genes. Here we engineer a set of CRISPR(a/i) tools containing heat-sensitive genetic modules controllable by FUS for the regulation of genome and epigenome in live cells and animals. We demonstrated the capabilities of FUS-inducible CRISPRa, CRISPRi, and CRISPR (FUS-CRISPR(a/i)) to upregulate, repress, and knockout exogenous and/or endogenous genes, respectively, in different cell types. We further targeted FUS-CRISPR to telomeres in tumor cells to induce telomere disruption, inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing tumor susceptibility to killing by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. FUS-CRISPR-mediated telomere disruption for tumor priming combined with CAR-T therapy demonstrated synergistic therapeutic effects in xenograft mouse models. The FUS-CRISPR(a/i) toolbox allows the remote, noninvasive, and spatiotemporal control of genomic and epigenomic reprogramming in vivo, with extended applications in cancer treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions 1-3. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry 4,5. Inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540, and 960 subunits. At 49, 71, and 96 nm diameter, these nanoparticles are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work represents an important step towards the accurate design of arbitrary self-assembling nanoscale protein objects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to precisely control the activity of defined cell populations enables studies of their physiological roles and may provide therapeutic applications. While prior studies have shown that magnetic activation of ferritin-tagged ion channels allows cell-specific modulation of cellular activity, the large size of the constructs made the use of adeno-associated virus, AAV, the vector of choice for gene therapy, impractical. In addition, simple means for generating magnetic fields of sufficient strength have been lacking. Toward these ends, we first generated a novel anti-ferritin nanobody that when fused to transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1, TRPV1, enables direct binding of the channel to endogenous ferritin in mouse and human cells. This smaller construct can be delivered in a single AAV and we validated that it robustly enables magnetically induced cell activation in vitro. In parallel, we developed a simple benchtop electromagnet capable of gating the nanobody-tagged channel in vivo. Finally, we showed that delivering these new constructs by AAV to pancreatic beta cells in combination with the benchtop magnetic field delivery stimulates glucose-stimulated insulin release to improve glucose tolerance in mice in vivo. Together, the novel anti-ferritin nanobody, nanobody-TRPV1 construct and new hardware advance the utility of magnetogenetics in animals and potentially humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Artificial organs and organs-on-a-chip are of great clinical and scientific interest and have recently been made by additive manufacturing, but depend on, and benefit from, biocompatible, biodegradable, and soft materials. Poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) citrate (POMaC) meets these criteria and has gained popularity, and as in principle, it can be photocured and is amenable to vat-photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing, but only low-resolution structures have been produced so fa. Here, we introduce a VP-POMaC ink and demonstrate 3D printing of high resolution (80 {micro}m) and complex 3D structures using low-cost ([~]US$300) liquid-crystal display (LCD) printers. The ink includes POMaC, a diluent and porogen additive to reduce viscosity within the range of VP, and a crosslinker to speed up reaction kinetics. The mechanical properties of the cured ink were tuned to match the elastic moduli of different tissues simply by varying the porogen concentration. The biocompatibility was assessed by cell culture which yielded 80% viability and the potential for tissue engineering illustrated with a 3D printed gyroid seeded with cells. VP-POMaC and low-cost LCD printers make the additive manufacturing of high resolution, elastomeric, and biodegradable constructs widely accessible, paving the way for a myriad of applications in tissue engineering, implants, organ-on-a-chip, wearables, and soft robotics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is currently on critical path for glioblastoma therapeutics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic functions of SDT remain enigmatic due to the lack of intricately optimised instrumentation capable of modulating SDT delivery in vitro. We established and validated an automated in vitro SDT system and assessed its SDT efficacy.

MethodsAn automated in vitro SDT system was established and validated to allow the application and mapping of focused ultrasound fields under varied acoustic exposure conditions and setup configurations. Ultrasound field simulations were performed to assess the acoustic energy exposure. Systematic in vitro investigations were performed to optimise ultrasound frequency, intensity, plate base material, thermal effect, and the integration of live cells.

ResultsIn the presence of 5-ALA, focused ultrasound induces apoptotic cell death in primary patient-derived glioma cells with concurrent upregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Intriguingly, primary glioma stem neurospheres also exhibit remarkably reduced 3D growth upon SDT exposure. Further, ultrasound field simulations performed established acoustic field distribution and the impact of acoustic standing waves within the well-plates.

ConclusionsThe optimised in vitro SDT system and associated ultrasound field simulations establish the basis for further understanding of SDT and its therapeutic potentials in cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are often contaminated by interference that can exceed the amplitude of physiological brain activity by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, activity of interference sources may leak into the activity of brain signals of interest, resulting in source estimation inaccuracies. This problem is particularly apparent when using MEG to interrogate the effects of brain stimulation on large scale cortical networks. This technical report offers two contributions. Firstly, using phantom MEG recordings we describe an approach for validating the estimation accuracy of brain stimulation evoked responses. Secondly, we propose a novel denoising method for suppressing the leakage of stimulation related signal into recorded brain activity. This approach leverages spatial and temporal domain projectors for signal arising from prespecified anatomical regions of interest. We highlight its advantages compared to the benchmark - spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) - and show that it can more accurately reveal brain stimulation evoked responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adoptively transferred T cells and agents designed to block the CD47/SIRP axis are promising antitumor therapeutics, which activate distinct arms of the immune system. We administered anti-CD47 (CD47) with adoptively transferred T cells with the goal of enhancing antitumor efficacy but observed rapid macrophage-mediated clearance of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or engineered T cell receptors, which blunted therapeutic benefit. CD47 mediated CAR T clearance was potent and rapid enough to serve as an effective safety switch. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a CD47 variant (47E) that engaged SIRP and provided a &#34;dont-eat-me&#34; signal that was not blocked by CD47 antibodies. TCR or CAR T cells expressing 47E were resistant to clearance by macrophages following CD47, and mediated significant, sustained macrophage recruitment into the TME. Although many of the recruited macrophages manifested an M2-like profile, the combined therapy resulted in synergistic enhancement in antitumor efficacy. This work identifies macrophages as major regulators of T cell persistence and illustrates the fundamental challenge of combining T cell directed therapeutics with those designed to activate macrophages. It further delivers a therapeutic approach capable of simultaneously harnessing the antitumor effects of T cells and macrophages that manifests markedly enhanced potency against solid tumors.</p>

This excludes the part of the research community without these capabilities. Here we introduce the openSIM add-on to upgrade existing optical microscopes to Structured Illumination super-resolution Microscopes (SIM). The openSIM is an open-hardware system, designed and documented to be easily duplicated by other laboratories, making super-resolution modality accessible to facilitate innovative research. The add-on approach gives a performance improvement for pre-existing lab equipment without the need to build a completely new system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), mechanosensitive valvular cells respond to fibrosis- and calcification-induced tissue stiffening, further driving pathophysiology. No pharmacotherapeutics are available to treat CAVD, due to the lack of: 1) appropriate experimental models that recapitulate this complex environment; and 2) benchmarking novel engineered AV-model performance. We established a biomaterial-based CAVD model mimicking the biomechanics of the human AV disease-prone fibrosa layer, 3D-bioprinted into 96-well arrays. LC-MS/MS analyses probed the cellular proteome and vesiculome to compare the 3D-bioprinted model vs. traditional 2D monoculture, against human CAVD tissue. The 3D-bioprinted model highly recapitulated the CAVD cellular proteome (94% vs. 70% of 2D proteins). Integration of cellular/vesicular datasets identified known and novel proteins ubiquitous to AV calcification. This study explores how 2D vs. 3D-bioengineered systems recapitulate unique aspects of human disease, positions multi-omics as a novel technique for the evaluation of high throughput-based bioengineered model systems and potentiates future drug discovery.</p>
