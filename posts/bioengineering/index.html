R.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565830\nHuman intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells co-differentiate both epithelial and mesenchymal lineages in vitro but lack important cell types such as neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle. Here, we report an in vitro method to derive HIOs with epithelium, mesenchyme, enteric neuroglial populations, endothelial cells, and organized smooth muscle in a single differentiation, without the need for co-culture. When transplanted into a murine host, these populations expand and organize to support organoid maturation and function. Functional experiments demonstrate enteric nervous system function, with HIOs undergoing peristaltic-like contractions, suggesting the development of a functional neuromuscular unit. HIOs also form functional vasculature, demonstrated in vitro using microfluidic devices to introduce vascular-like flow, and in vivo following transplantation, where HIO endothelial cells anastomose with host vasculature. Collectively, we report an in vitro model of the human gut that simultaneously co-differentiates epithelial, stromal, endothelial, neural, and organized muscle populations.\nDNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Cargo Transfer\nAuthors: Buber, E.; Yaadav, R.; Schroeder, T.; Franquelim, H. G.; Tinnefeld, P.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565475\nInteracting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.\nAccelerated design of Escherichia coli genomes with reduced size using a whole-cell model and machine learning surrogate\nAuthors: Gherman, I. M.; Rees-Garbutt, J. P.; Pang, W.; Abdallah, Z. S.; Gorochowski, T. E.; Grierson, C. S.; Marucci, L.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564402\nWhole-cell models (WCMs) are multi-scale computational models that aim to accurately simulate the function of all genes and biological processes within a cell. While WCMs offer deeper insights into why cells behave and respond in specific ways, they also require significant computational resources to run, making their development and use challenging. To address this limitation it is possible to use simpler machine learning (ML) surrogates that can learn to approximate specific behaviours of larger and more complex models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. Here, we show how ML surrogates can be trained on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). We used these surrogates and a genome-design algorithm to generate a reduced E. coli cell in silico, where 39% of the genes included in the WCM were removed, a task made possible by our ML surrogate that performs simulations up to 16 times faster than the original WCM. These results demonstrate the value of adopting WCMs and ML surrogates for enabling genome-wide engineering of living cells, offering promising new routes for biologists to understand better how cellular phenotypes emerge from genotypes.\nRho/ROCK activity tunes cell compartment segregation and differentiation in nephron-forming niches\nAuthors: Viola, J. M.; Liu, J.; Huang, A.; Grindel, S. H.; Prahl, L. S.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566308\nControlling the time and place of nephron formation in vitro would improve nephron density and connectivity in next-generation kidney replacement tissues. Recent developments in kidney organoid technology have paved the way to achieving self-sustaining nephrogenic niches in vitro. The physical and geometric structure of the niche are key control parameters in tissue engineering approaches. However, their relationship to nephron differentiation is unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between niche geometry, cell compartment mixing, and nephron differentiation by targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway, a master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. We find that the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases mixing between nephron progenitor and stromal compartments in native mouse embryonic kidney niches, and also increases nephrogenesis. Similar increases are also seen in reductionist mouse primary cell and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids perturbed by Y-27632, dependent on the presence of stromal cells. Our data indicate that niche organization is a determinant of nephron formation rate, bringing renewed focus to the spatial context of cell-cell interactions in kidney tissue engineering efforts.\nHow to prevent endothelial cells from losing their edge: a simple patterning of development-like matrix guides a microvessel morphogenetic process by self-organization\nAuthors: Monroy-Romero, A. X.; Nieto-Rivera, B.; Xiao, W.; Hautefeuille, M.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564881\nVascular engineering seeks to generate reliable models for studying cellular interactions in the context of preserving homeostasis and disease development. However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.\nPerpetual bioplastic production by a cyanobacteria-dominated microbiome\nAuthors: Altamira, B.; Arnau Roca, M.; Lage, A.; Gonzalez-Flo, E.; Garcia, J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565755\nDeparting from the conventional axenic and heterotrophic cultures, our research ventures into unexplored territory by investigating the potential of photosynthetic microbiomes for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. A cyanobacteria-rich microbiome was harnessed for PHB production in a 3 L photobioreactor under non-sterile conditions. The robust culture achieved up to 28 %dcw PHB over 108 days of alternating growth and accumulation phases. Nile Blue staining and Transmission Electron Microscope visualization successfully confirmed the presence of PHB granules within cyanobacteria cells. Analysis through proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance further validated the extracted polymer as PHB. In addition, the overexpression of the enzyme PHA synthase throughout the accumulation phase correlated directly with the increased PHB production. Also, gene expression changes suggested that initially, glycogen served as the primary storage compound. However, with prolonged macronutrient stress, there was a shift of the carbon flux towards favoring PHB synthesis. Overall, it was demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using a phototrophic microbiome to continuous production of PHB in a non-sterile system, contributing to advancing in the field of biopolymer production and offering valuable insights into the metabolic pathways involved.\nPlanar Amorphous Silicon Carbide Microelectrode Arrays for Chronic Recording in Rat Motor Cortex\nAuthors: Abbott, J. R.; Jeakle, E. N.; Haghihi, P.; Usoro, J. O.; Sturgill, B. S.; Wu, Y.; Geramifard, N.; Radhakrishna, R.; Patnaik, S.; Nakajima, S.; Hess, J.; Mehmood, Y.; Devata, V.; Vijayakumar, G.; Sood, A.; Thai, T. T. D.; Dogra, K.; Hernandez-Reynoso, A. G.; Pancrazio, J. J.; Cogan, S. F.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565338\nChronic implantation of intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) capable of recording from individual neurons can be used for the development of brain-machine interfaces. However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brains foreign body response. This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the foreign body response to enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the foreign body response is the use of ultrathin MEAs. Here, we fabricated ultrathin (cross-sectional area: 160 {micro}m2) amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs with sixteen electrode channels and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication techniques. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized in vitro pre-implantation and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50 mV/s and 50,000 mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30 kHz impedance values and 50,000 mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50 mV/s CV and 1 Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6 M{Omega} to 13.5 M{Omega} at 1 Hz, 1.2 M{Omega} to 2.9 M{Omega} at 1 kHz, and 0.11 M{Omega} to 0.13 M{Omega} at 30 kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50 mV/s were 58.1 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 55.9 mC/cm2 on week 16, and at 50,000 mV/s were 4.27 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 5.93 mC/cm2 on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of only -0.19 per week. We also classified the units as fast and slow spiking based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow spiking units declined at a similar rate. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed minimal foreign body response to the a-SiC devices, as highlighted by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cells between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neural cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results support the use of ultrathin a-SiC MEAs for long-term implantation and use in brain-machine interfaces.\nBiomechanical Modeling of Cesarean Section Scars and Scar Defects\nAuthors: Scott, A. K.; Louwagie, E. M.; Myers, K. M.; Oyen, M. L.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565565\nUterine rupture is an intrinsically biomechanical process associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. A previous Cesarean section (C-section) is the main risk factor for uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy due to tissue failure at the scar region. Finite element modeling of the uterus and scar tissue presents a promising method to further understand and predict uterine ruptures. Using patient dimensions of an at-term uterus, a C-section scar was modeled with an applied intrauterine pressure to study how scars affect uterine stress. The scar positioning and uterine thickness were varied, and a thickness defect was incorporated into the scar region. The modeled stress distributions confirmed clinical observations as the increased regions of stress due to scar positioning, thinning of the uterine walls, and the presence of a defect are consistent with clinical observations of features that increase the risk of uterine rupture.\nBiodesign of Frugal CRISPR Kits for Equitable and Accessible Education\nAuthors: Collins, M. C.; Lau, M. B.; Ma, W.; Shen, A.; La Russa, M.; Qi, L. S.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562372\nEquitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes has remained restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer hands-on experience in genome engineering, and will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.\nThe Bundles of Intercrossing Fibers of the Extensor Mechanism of the Fingers Greatly Influence the Transmission of Muscle Forces\nAuthors: Dogadov, A. A.; Valero-Cuevas, F. J.; Serviere, C.; Quaine, F.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565148\nThe extensor mechanism is a tendinous structure that plays an important role in finger function. It transmits forces from several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles to multiple bony attachments along the finger via sheets of collagen fibers. The most important attachments are located at the base of the second and third phalanges (proximal and distal attachments, respectively). How the forces from the muscles contribute to the forces at the attachment points, however, is not fully known. In addition to the well-accepted medial and lateral bands, there exist two layers of intercrossing fiber bundles (superficial interosseous medial fiber layer and deeper extensor lateral fiber layer), connecting them. In contrast to its common idealization as a minimal network of distinct strings, we built a numerical model consisting of fiber bundles to evaluate the role of multiple intercrossing fibers in the production of static finger forces. We compared this more detailed model of the extensor mechanism to the idealized minimal network that only includes the medial and lateral bands. We find that including bundles of intercrossing fibers significantly affects force transmission, which itself depends on finger posture. In a mid-flexion posture (metacarpal joint MCP = 45{degrees}; proximal interphalangeal joint PIP = 45{degrees}; distal interphalangeal joint DIP = 10{degrees}) the force transmitted by the lateral fibers is 40% lower than in a more pronounced flexed posture (MCP = 90{degrees}; PIP = 90{degrees}; DIP = 80{degrees}). We conclude that the intercrossing fiber bundles -- traditionally left out in prior models since Zancollis simplification -- play an important role in force transmission and variation of the latter with posture.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells co-differentiate both epithelial and mesenchymal lineages in vitro but lack important cell types such as neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle. Here, we report an in vitro method to derive HIOs with epithelium, mesenchyme, enteric neuroglial populations, endothelial cells, and organized smooth muscle in a single differentiation, without the need for co-culture. When transplanted into a murine host, these populations expand and organize to support organoid maturation and function. Functional experiments demonstrate enteric nervous system function, with HIOs undergoing peristaltic-like contractions, suggesting the development of a functional neuromuscular unit. HIOs also form functional vasculature, demonstrated in vitro using microfluidic devices to introduce vascular-like flow, and in vivo following transplantation, where HIO endothelial cells anastomose with host vasculature. Collectively, we report an in vitro model of the human gut that simultaneously co-differentiates epithelial, stromal, endothelial, neural, and organized muscle populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whole-cell models (WCMs) are multi-scale computational models that aim to accurately simulate the function of all genes and biological processes within a cell. While WCMs offer deeper insights into why cells behave and respond in specific ways, they also require significant computational resources to run, making their development and use challenging. To address this limitation it is possible to use simpler machine learning (ML) surrogates that can learn to approximate specific behaviours of larger and more complex models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. Here, we show how ML surrogates can be trained on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). We used these surrogates and a genome-design algorithm to generate a reduced E. coli cell in silico, where 39% of the genes included in the WCM were removed, a task made possible by our ML surrogate that performs simulations up to 16 times faster than the original WCM. These results demonstrate the value of adopting WCMs and ML surrogates for enabling genome-wide engineering of living cells, offering promising new routes for biologists to understand better how cellular phenotypes emerge from genotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Controlling the time and place of nephron formation in vitro would improve nephron density and connectivity in next-generation kidney replacement tissues. Recent developments in kidney organoid technology have paved the way to achieving self-sustaining nephrogenic niches in vitro. The physical and geometric structure of the niche are key control parameters in tissue engineering approaches. However, their relationship to nephron differentiation is unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between niche geometry, cell compartment mixing, and nephron differentiation by targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway, a master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. We find that the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases mixing between nephron progenitor and stromal compartments in native mouse embryonic kidney niches, and also increases nephrogenesis. Similar increases are also seen in reductionist mouse primary cell and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids perturbed by Y-27632, dependent on the presence of stromal cells. Our data indicate that niche organization is a determinant of nephron formation rate, bringing renewed focus to the spatial context of cell-cell interactions in kidney tissue engineering efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vascular engineering seeks to generate reliable models for studying cellular interactions in the context of preserving homeostasis and disease development. However, current systems mainly focus on recapitulating large blood vessels embedded in thick extracellular matrix gels or do not address discontinuous capillaries, crucial microvascular structures. By adapting a Marangoni flow-driven protein densification process on GelTrex domes, we promoted the self-organization of endothelial cells into mature lumenized vessels by anisotropic directional organization following an edge micropattern. Our findings revealed a sequential morphogenetic process leading to microvessels with both murine and human immortalized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Differential behaviors were found on the whole sample and cell migration, proliferation and polarization were guided by this pattern to form a long multicellular cord. Cells forming this structure deformed large regions of the dome, generating a wave-like fold all around it, hinged in a laminin depletion zone. This wrapped the cell cords with proteins from the gel which marked the beginning of a lumenogenesis process, regulated by a change in the apico-basal polarization of the cord cells, followed by maturation of tight junctions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a lumen; all steps reported in in vivo vessel development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometry of the vessels can be controlled by initial topography of the gel. We believe our simple fabrication method, guiding an autonomous self-organization of vessels without the need for supporting cells or complex prefabricated scaffolds, is suitable for future integration into microphysiological systems of discontinuous, fenestrated capillaries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Departing from the conventional axenic and heterotrophic cultures, our research ventures into unexplored territory by investigating the potential of photosynthetic microbiomes for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. A cyanobacteria-rich microbiome was harnessed for PHB production in a 3 L photobioreactor under non-sterile conditions. The robust culture achieved up to 28 %dcw PHB over 108 days of alternating growth and accumulation phases. Nile Blue staining and Transmission Electron Microscope visualization successfully confirmed the presence of PHB granules within cyanobacteria cells. Analysis through proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance further validated the extracted polymer as PHB. In addition, the overexpression of the enzyme PHA synthase throughout the accumulation phase correlated directly with the increased PHB production. Also, gene expression changes suggested that initially, glycogen served as the primary storage compound. However, with prolonged macronutrient stress, there was a shift of the carbon flux towards favoring PHB synthesis. Overall, it was demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using a phototrophic microbiome to continuous production of PHB in a non-sterile system, contributing to advancing in the field of biopolymer production and offering valuable insights into the metabolic pathways involved.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic implantation of intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) capable of recording from individual neurons can be used for the development of brain-machine interfaces. However, these devices show reduced recording capabilities under chronic conditions due, at least in part, to the brains foreign body response. This creates a need for MEAs that can minimize the foreign body response to enable long-term recording. A potential approach to reduce the foreign body response is the use of ultrathin MEAs. Here, we fabricated ultrathin (cross-sectional area: 160 {micro}m2) amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) MEAs with sixteen electrode channels and implanted them into the motor cortex of seven female Sprague-Dawley rats. A-SiC was chosen as the fabrication base for its high chemical stability, good electrical insulation properties, and amenability to thin film fabrication techniques. Electrochemical analysis and neural recordings were performed weekly for 4 months. MEAs were characterized in vitro pre-implantation and in vivo using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at 50 mV/s and 50,000 mV/s. Neural recordings were analyzed for single unit activity. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry analysis. We observed statistically significant, but small, increases in 1 and 30 kHz impedance values and 50,000 mV/s charge storage capacity over the 16-week implantation period. Slow sweep 50 mV/s CV and 1 Hz impedance did not significantly change over time. Impedance values increased from 11.6 M{Omega} to 13.5 M{Omega} at 1 Hz, 1.2 M{Omega} to 2.9 M{Omega} at 1 kHz, and 0.11 M{Omega} to 0.13 M{Omega} at 30 kHz over 16 weeks. The median charge storage capacity of the implanted electrodes at 50 mV/s were 58.1 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 55.9 mC/cm2 on week 16, and at 50,000 mV/s were 4.27 mC/cm2 on week 1 and 5.93 mC/cm2 on week 16. Devices were able to record neural activity from 92% of all active channels at the beginning of the study, At the study endpoint, a-SiC devices were still recording single-unit activity on 51% of electrochemically active electrode channels. In addition, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio experienced a small decline of only -0.19 per week. We also classified the units as fast and slow spiking based on the trough-to-peak time. Although the overall presence of single units declined, fast and slow spiking units declined at a similar rate. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed minimal foreign body response to the a-SiC devices, as highlighted by statistically insignificant differences in activated glial cells between implanted brains slices and contralateral sham slices, as evidenced by GFAP staining. NeuN staining revealed the presence of neural cell bodies close to the implantation site, again statistically not different from a contralateral sham slice. These results support the use of ultrathin a-SiC MEAs for long-term implantation and use in brain-machine interfaces.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Uterine rupture is an intrinsically biomechanical process associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. A previous Cesarean section (C-section) is the main risk factor for uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy due to tissue failure at the scar region. Finite element modeling of the uterus and scar tissue presents a promising method to further understand and predict uterine ruptures. Using patient dimensions of an at-term uterus, a C-section scar was modeled with an applied intrauterine pressure to study how scars affect uterine stress. The scar positioning and uterine thickness were varied, and a thickness defect was incorporated into the scar region. The modeled stress distributions confirmed clinical observations as the increased regions of stress due to scar positioning, thinning of the uterine walls, and the presence of a defect are consistent with clinical observations of features that increase the risk of uterine rupture.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Equitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes has remained restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer hands-on experience in genome engineering, and will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The extensor mechanism is a tendinous structure that plays an important role in finger function. It transmits forces from several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles to multiple bony attachments along the finger via sheets of collagen fibers. The most important attachments are located at the base of the second and third phalanges (proximal and distal attachments, respectively). How the forces from the muscles contribute to the forces at the attachment points, however, is not fully known. In addition to the well-accepted medial and lateral bands, there exist two layers of intercrossing fiber bundles (superficial interosseous medial fiber layer and deeper extensor lateral fiber layer), connecting them. In contrast to its common idealization as a minimal network of distinct strings, we built a numerical model consisting of fiber bundles to evaluate the role of multiple intercrossing fibers in the production of static finger forces. We compared this more detailed model of the extensor mechanism to the idealized minimal network that only includes the medial and lateral bands. We find that including bundles of intercrossing fibers significantly affects force transmission, which itself depends on finger posture. In a mid-flexion posture (metacarpal joint MCP = 45{degrees}; proximal interphalangeal joint PIP = 45{degrees}; distal interphalangeal joint DIP = 10{degrees}) the force transmitted by the lateral fibers is 40% lower than in a more pronounced flexed posture (MCP = 90{degrees}; PIP = 90{degrees}; DIP = 80{degrees}). We conclude that the intercrossing fiber bundles -- traditionally left out in prior models since Zancollis simplification -- play an important role in force transmission and variation of the latter with posture.</p>
