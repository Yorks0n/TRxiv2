M.; Triesscheijn, C. S.; Monica, B.; Paspali, I.; Tielemans, M.; Francois, J. J.; Seinen, C. W.; de Jong, O. G.; Kooijmans, S. A.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563755\nIntercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been identified as a vital component of a steadily expanding number of physiological and pathological processes. To accommodate these roles, EVs are equipped with specific proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules by EV-secreting cells. Consequently, EVs have highly heterogeneous molecular compositions. Given that surface molecules on EVs determine their interactions with their environment, it is conceivable that EV functionality differs between subpopulations with varying surface compositions. However, it has been technically challenging to examine such functional heterogeneity due to a lack of non-destructive methods to separate EV subpopulations based on their surface markers. Here, we used Design-of-Experiments methodology to rapidly optimize a protocol, which we name 'EV-Elute', to elute intact EVs from commercially available Protein G-coated magnetic beads. We captured EVs from various cell types on these beads using antibodies against CD9, CD63, CD81 and a custom-made protein binding phosphatidylserine (PS). When applying EV-Elute, over 70% of bound EVs could be recovered from the beads in a pH- and incubation time-dependent fashion. EV subpopulations were found to be devoid of co-isolated protein contaminants observed in whole EV isolates and showed intact morphology by electron microscopy. Proteinase K protection assays showed a mild and reversible decrease of EV membrane integrity during elution. Depending on the type of capturing antibody used, some antibodies remained EV-associated after elution. EV subpopulations showed uptake patterns similar to whole EV isolates in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. However, in Cas9/sgRNA delivery assays, CD63+ EVs showed a lower capacity to functionally deliver cargo as compared to CD9+, CD81+ and PS+ EVs. Taken together, we developed a novel, easy-to-use platform to isolate and functionally compare surface marker-defined EV subpopulations. Importantly, this platform does not require specialized equipment or reagents and is universally applicable to any capturing antibody and EV source. Hence, EV-Elute can open new opportunities to study EV functionality at the subpopulation level.\nDesigner Fat Cells: Adipogenic Differentiation of CRISPR-Cas9 Genome-Engineered Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells\nAuthors: Ely, E. V.; Kapinski, A. T.; Paradi, S. G.; Tang, R.; Guilak, F.; Collins, K. H.-M.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564206\nAdipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that can signal bidirectionally to many tissues and organ systems in the body. With obesity, adipose tissue is a source of low-level inflammation that contributes to various co-morbidities and damage to downstream effector tissues. The ability to synthesize genetically engineered adipose tissue could have critical applications in studying adipokine signaling and the use of adipose tissue for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to develop a method for non-viral adipogenic differentiation of genome-edited murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to test the ability of such cells to engraft in mice in vivo. Designer adipocytes were created from iPSCs, which can be readily genetically engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out or insert individual genes of interest. As a model system for adipocyte-based drug delivery, an existing iPSC cell line that transcribes interleukin 1 receptor antagonist under the endogenous macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 promoter was tested for adipogenic capabilities under these same differentiation conditions. To understand the role of various adipocyte subtypes and their impact on health and disease, an efficient method was devised for inducing browning and whitening of IPSC-derived adipocytes in culture. Finally, to study the downstream effects of designer adipocytes in vivo, we transplanted the designer adipocytes into fat-free lipodystrophic mice as a model system for studying adipose signaling in different models of disease or repair. This novel translational tissue engineering and regenerative medicine platform provides an innovative approach to studying the role of adipose interorgan communication in various conditions.\nHighly-parallel production of designer organoids by mosaic patterning of progenitors\nAuthors: Porter, C.

J.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.564017\nHuman organoids are a promising approach for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, organoid variability and limited control over morphological outcomes remain significant challenges. Here we extend a DNA velcro cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells. We demonstrate long-term control over organoid size and morphology, decoupled from geometric constraints.\nDeveloping small Cas9 hybrids using molecular modeling\nAuthors: Mangin, A.; Dion, V.; Menzies, G.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563270\nThe RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best characterized enzyme for gene editing. Its large size, however, precludes it from being packaged together with its single guide (sg)RNA into a single adeno-associated virus, limiting in vivo applications. Here, we developed smaller Cas9 hybrids, made of the PAM interacting domain (PID) of S pyogenes and the catalytic domains of the smaller Cas9 orthologues, as well as sgRNA cognate hybrids. Molecular modeling revealed that the presence of a sgRNA stabilizes Cas9. Making the D10A mutation to turn Cas9 into a nickase dramatically alters its binding energy to the sgRNA, showing that the approach can identify functionally relevant changes. However, we found that the four Cas9/sgRNA hybrid pairs tested in human cells failed to edit target sequences. We conclude that in silico approaches can identify functional changes caused by point mutations but they may not be well suited for designing Cas9/sgRNA hybrids.\nMultifunction Fluorescence Open-Source In Vivo/In Vitro Imaging System (openIVIS)\nAuthors: Branning, J. M.; Faughnan, K. A.; Tomson, A. A.; Bell, G. J.; Isbell, S. M.; DeGroot, A.; Jameson, L.; Kilroy, K.; Smith, M.; Smith, R.; Mottel, L.; Branning, E. G.; Warrall, Z.; Anderson, F.; Panditaradyula, A.; Yang, W.; Abdelmalek, J.; Brake, J.; Cash, K. J.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561111\nThe widespread availability and diversity of open-source microcontrollers paired with off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed technology has led to the creation of a wide range of low-cost scientific instruments, including microscopes, spectrometers, sensors, data loggers, and other tools that can be used for research, education, and experimentation. These devices can be used to explore a wide range of scientific topics, from biology and chemistry to physics and engineering. In this study we designed and built a multifunction fluorescent open-source in-vivo/in-vitro imaging system (openIVIS) fluorescent imaging system that integrates a Raspberry Pi with commercial cameras and LEDs with 3D printed structures combined with an acrylic housing. Our openIVIS provides three excitation wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm, and 630 nm integrated with Python control software to enable fluorescent measurements across the full visible light spectrum. To demonstrate the various potential applications of our system, we tested its performance against a diverse set of experiments including laboratory type assays (measuring fluorescent dyes, using optical nanosensors, and DNA gel electrophoresis) to potentially fieldable applications (plant and mineral imaging). We also tested the potential use for a high school biology environment by imaging small animals and tracking their development over the course of a couple of weeks. Our system demonstrated its ability to measure a wide dynamic range fluorescent response from millimolar to picomolar concentrations in the same sample while measuring responses across visible wavelengths. These results demonstrate the power and flexibility of open-source hardware and software and how it can be integrated with customizable manufacturing to create low-cost scientific instruments with a wide range of applications. Our study provides a promising model for the development of low-cost instruments that can be used in both research and education.\nAI-powered smart glasses for sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments\nAuthors: Rossos, D.; Mihailidis, A.; Laschowski, B.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563804\nEnvironment sensing and recognition can allow humans and robots to dynamically adapt to different walking terrains. However, fast and accurate visual perception is challenging, especially on embedded devices with limited computational resources. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel pair of AI-powered smart glasses for onboard sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments with high accuracy and low latency. We used a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and an ArduCam HM0360 low-power camera, both of which interface with the eyeglass frames using 3D-printed mounts that we custom-designed. We trained and optimized a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network using a MobileNetV1 backbone to classify the walking terrain as either indoor surfaces, outdoor surfaces (grass and dirt), or outdoor surfaces (paved) using over 62,500 egocentric images that we adapted and manually labelled from the Meta Ego4D dataset. We then compiled and deployed our deep learning model using TensorFlow Lite Micro and post-training quantization to create a minimized byte array model of size 0.31MB. Our system was able to accurately predict complex walking environments with 93.6% classification accuracy and had an embedded inference speed of 1.5 seconds during online experiments using the integrated camera and microcontroller. Our AI-powered smart glasses open new opportunities for visual perception of human-robot walking environments where embedded inference and a low form factor is required. Future research will focus on improving the onboard inference speed and miniaturization of the mechatronic components.\nZNF865 Regulates Senescence and Cell Cycle for Applications to Cell Engineering and Gene Therapy\nAuthors: Levis, H.; Lewis, C.; Stockham, E.; Weston, J. D.; Lawal, A.; Lawrence, B.; Gullbrand, S. E.; Bowles, R. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563801\nZinc finger (ZNF) proteins represent the largest group of regulatory proteins within eukaryotic genomes. However, despite their broad regulatory function, the majority of ZNF protein function remains unknown. Recently, we discovered ZNF865, which has no in-depth publications and has not been functionally characterized. Utilizing CRISPR-guided gene modulation, we show that ZNF865 regulates key cellular and molecular processes associated with healthy cell function by primarily regulating cellular senescence, cell cycle progression, and protein processing. As a result, regulating this gene acts as a primary titratable regulator of cell activity, and we demonstrate the potential of targeted ZNF865 regulation as a tool to control senescence and protein production in multiple clinically relevant cell types for cell engineering/tissue engineering/gene therapy applications. We demonstrate its ability to rescue human senescent cell populations, boost T-cell activity, and dramatically deposit more cartilaginous tissue in a whole organ tissue-engineered intervertebral disc. Overall, we present novel biology and regulatory mechanisms of senescence and cell cycle that were previously unknown and display the power of CRISPR-cell engineering to enhance cell engineering strategies treating disease.\nMicrobubble dynamics in brain microvessels\nAuthors: Bezer, J. H.; Prentice, P.; Lim Kee Chang, W.; Morse, S. V.; Christensen-Jeffries, K.; Rowlands, C. J.; Kozlov, A.; Choi, J. J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563941\nBackground Focused ultrasound stimulation of microbubbles is being tested in clinical trials for its ability to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This technique has the potential to treat neurological diseases by preferentially delivering drugs to targeted regions. Yet despite its potential, the physical mechanisms by which microbubbles alter the BBB permeability remain unclear, as direct observations of microbubbles oscillating in cerebral capillaries have never been previously recorded. The purpose of this study was to reveal how microbubbles respond to ultrasound when within the microvessels of living brain tissue. Methods Microbubbles in acute brain slices acquired from juvenile rats perfused with a concentrated solution of SonoVue (Registered Trademark) and dye were exposed to ultrasound pulses typically used in BBB disruption (center frequency: 1 MHz, peak-negative pressure: 0.2-1 MPa, pulse length: up to 10 ms) and observed using high-speed microscopy at up to 10 million frames per second. Results We observed that microbubbles can exert mechanical stresses on a wide region of tissue beyond their initial location and immediate surroundings. A single microbubble can apply mechanical stress to parenchymal tissues several micrometers away from the vessel. Microbubbles can travel at high velocities within the microvessels, extending their influence across tens of micrometers during a single pulse. With longer pulses and higher pressures, microbubbles could penetrate the vessel wall and move through the parenchyma, refuting a previous assumption that microbubbles are confined to vessels. The probability of extravasation scales approximately with mechanical index, being rare at low pressures, but much more common at a mechanical index [\u0026ge;] 0.6. Conclusions These observations provide important insight into microbubble dynamics in microvessels, and are critical leads into ultimately identifying the microbubble activities that lead to both safe drug delivery and into activities we seek to avoid, such as petechiae and other bioeffects.\nTargeted genome editing restores auditory function in adult mice with progressive hearing loss caused by a human microRNA mutation\nAuthors: Zhu, W.; Du, W.; Rameshbabu, A. P.; Armstrong, A. M.; Silver, S.; Kim, Y.; Wei, W.; Shu, Y.; Liu, X.; Lewis, M. A.; Steel, K. P.; Chen, Z.-Y.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564008\nMutations in microRNA-96 (MIR96) cause dominant delayed onset hearing loss DFNA50 without treatment. Genome editing has shown efficacy in hearing recovery by intervention in neonatal mice, yet editing in the adult inner ear is necessary for clinical applications. Here, we developed an editing therapy for a C\u003eA point mutation in the seed region of the Mir96 gene, Mir9614C\u003eA associated with hearing loss by screening gRNAs for genome editors and optimizing Cas9 and sgRNA scaffold for efficient and specific mutation editing in vitro. By AAV delivery in pre-symptomatic (3-week-old) and symptomatic (6-week-old) adult Mir9614C\u003eA mutant mice, hair cell on-target editing significantly improved hearing long-term, with an efficacy inversely correlated with injection age. We achieved transient Cas9 expression without the evidence of AAV genomic integration to significantly reduce the safety concerns associated with editing. We developed an AAV-sgmiR96-master system capable of targeting all known human MIR96 mutations. As mouse and human MIR96 sequences share 100% homology, our approach and sgRNA selection for efficient and specific hair cell editing for long-term hearing recovery lays the foundation for future treatment of DFNA50 caused by MIR96 mutations.\nSynthetic Biodegradable Void-forming Hydrogels for In Vitro 3D Culture of Functional Human Bone Cell Networks\nAuthors: Zauchner, D.; Muller, M. Z.; Horrer, M.; Bissig, L.; Zhao, F.; Lee, S. S.; Muller, R.; Qin, X.-H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563580\nGenerating 3D bone cell networks in vitro that accurately mimic the dynamic process of osteoblast embedding during early bone formation poses a significant challenge. Herein, we report a synthetic biodegradable macroporous hydrogel for efficient formation of 3D networks from human primary cells, analysis of cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) and microfluidic integration. Using polymerization-induced phase separation, matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive polyethylene glycol hydrogels are formed with interconnected porosity in the presence of living cells. The pore size (5-20 m) and permeability can be fine-tuned by adjusting the concentration and molecular weight of dextran. After encapsulation in these hydrogels, human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts form a 3D cell network within 24 hours. The synthetic nature of this hydrogel enables histological analysis of cell-secreted collagen, a task previously challenging using collagen-derived hydrogels. Moreover, this hydrogel is integrated with a commercial chip, showcasing the potential for microfluidic perfusion cultures. Time-lapsed imaging of fluid flow and fast formation of 3D cell networks is demonstrated on chip. Altogether, this work introduces a versatile synthetic macroporous hydrogel, which can be integrated with microfluidic chip to enable 3D culture of human bone cell networks and analysis of cell-secreted ECM. This hydrogel may facilitate future mechanistic studies on bone development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been identified as a vital component of a steadily expanding number of physiological and pathological processes. To accommodate these roles, EVs are equipped with specific proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules by EV-secreting cells. Consequently, EVs have highly heterogeneous molecular compositions. Given that surface molecules on EVs determine their interactions with their environment, it is conceivable that EV functionality differs between subpopulations with varying surface compositions. However, it has been technically challenging to examine such functional heterogeneity due to a lack of non-destructive methods to separate EV subpopulations based on their surface markers. Here, we used Design-of-Experiments methodology to rapidly optimize a protocol, which we name &#39;EV-Elute&#39;, to elute intact EVs from commercially available Protein G-coated magnetic beads. We captured EVs from various cell types on these beads using antibodies against CD9, CD63, CD81 and a custom-made protein binding phosphatidylserine (PS). When applying EV-Elute, over 70% of bound EVs could be recovered from the beads in a pH- and incubation time-dependent fashion. EV subpopulations were found to be devoid of co-isolated protein contaminants observed in whole EV isolates and showed intact morphology by electron microscopy. Proteinase K protection assays showed a mild and reversible decrease of EV membrane integrity during elution. Depending on the type of capturing antibody used, some antibodies remained EV-associated after elution. EV subpopulations showed uptake patterns similar to whole EV isolates in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. However, in Cas9/sgRNA delivery assays, CD63&#43; EVs showed a lower capacity to functionally deliver cargo as compared to CD9&#43;, CD81&#43; and PS&#43; EVs. Taken together, we developed a novel, easy-to-use platform to isolate and functionally compare surface marker-defined EV subpopulations. Importantly, this platform does not require specialized equipment or reagents and is universally applicable to any capturing antibody and EV source. Hence, EV-Elute can open new opportunities to study EV functionality at the subpopulation level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that can signal bidirectionally to many tissues and organ systems in the body. With obesity, adipose tissue is a source of low-level inflammation that contributes to various co-morbidities and damage to downstream effector tissues. The ability to synthesize genetically engineered adipose tissue could have critical applications in studying adipokine signaling and the use of adipose tissue for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to develop a method for non-viral adipogenic differentiation of genome-edited murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to test the ability of such cells to engraft in mice in vivo. Designer adipocytes were created from iPSCs, which can be readily genetically engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out or insert individual genes of interest. As a model system for adipocyte-based drug delivery, an existing iPSC cell line that transcribes interleukin 1 receptor antagonist under the endogenous macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 promoter was tested for adipogenic capabilities under these same differentiation conditions. To understand the role of various adipocyte subtypes and their impact on health and disease, an efficient method was devised for inducing browning and whitening of IPSC-derived adipocytes in culture. Finally, to study the downstream effects of designer adipocytes in vivo, we transplanted the designer adipocytes into fat-free lipodystrophic mice as a model system for studying adipose signaling in different models of disease or repair. This novel translational tissue engineering and regenerative medicine platform provides an innovative approach to studying the role of adipose interorgan communication in various conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human organoids are a promising approach for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, organoid variability and limited control over morphological outcomes remain significant challenges. Here we extend a DNA  velcro cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells. We demonstrate long-term control over organoid size and morphology, decoupled from geometric constraints.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best characterized enzyme for gene editing. Its large size, however, precludes it from being packaged together with its single guide (sg)RNA into a single adeno-associated virus, limiting in vivo applications. Here, we developed smaller Cas9 hybrids, made of the PAM interacting domain (PID) of S pyogenes and the catalytic domains of the smaller Cas9 orthologues, as well as sgRNA cognate hybrids. Molecular modeling revealed that the presence of a sgRNA stabilizes Cas9. Making the D10A mutation to turn Cas9 into a nickase dramatically alters its binding energy to the sgRNA, showing that the approach can identify functionally relevant changes. However, we found that the four Cas9/sgRNA hybrid pairs tested in human cells failed to edit target sequences. We conclude that in silico approaches can identify functional changes caused by point mutations but they may not be well suited for designing Cas9/sgRNA hybrids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The widespread availability and diversity of open-source microcontrollers paired with off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed technology has led to the creation of a wide range of low-cost scientific instruments, including microscopes, spectrometers, sensors, data loggers, and other tools that can be used for research, education, and experimentation. These devices can be used to explore a wide range of scientific topics, from biology and chemistry to physics and engineering. In this study we designed and built a multifunction fluorescent open-source in-vivo/in-vitro imaging system (openIVIS) fluorescent imaging system that integrates a Raspberry Pi with commercial cameras and LEDs with 3D printed structures combined with an acrylic housing. Our openIVIS provides three excitation wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm, and 630 nm integrated with Python control software to enable fluorescent measurements across the full visible light spectrum. To demonstrate the various potential applications of our system, we tested its performance against a diverse set of experiments including laboratory type assays (measuring fluorescent dyes, using optical nanosensors, and DNA gel electrophoresis) to potentially fieldable applications (plant and mineral imaging). We also tested the potential use for a high school biology environment by imaging small animals and tracking their development over the course of a couple of weeks. Our system demonstrated its ability to measure a wide dynamic range fluorescent response from millimolar to picomolar concentrations in the same sample while measuring responses across visible wavelengths. These results demonstrate the power and flexibility of open-source hardware and software and how it can be integrated with customizable manufacturing to create low-cost scientific instruments with a wide range of applications. Our study provides a promising model for the development of low-cost instruments that can be used in both research and education.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environment sensing and recognition can allow humans and robots to dynamically adapt to different walking terrains. However, fast and accurate visual perception is challenging, especially on embedded devices with limited computational resources. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel pair of AI-powered smart glasses for onboard sensing and recognition of human-robot walking environments with high accuracy and low latency. We used a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and an ArduCam HM0360 low-power camera, both of which interface with the eyeglass frames using 3D-printed mounts that we custom-designed. We trained and optimized a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network using a MobileNetV1 backbone to classify the walking terrain as either indoor surfaces, outdoor surfaces (grass and dirt), or outdoor surfaces (paved) using over 62,500 egocentric images that we adapted and manually labelled from the Meta Ego4D dataset. We then compiled and deployed our deep learning model using TensorFlow Lite Micro and post-training quantization to create a minimized byte array model of size 0.31MB. Our system was able to accurately predict complex walking environments with 93.6% classification accuracy and had an embedded inference speed of 1.5 seconds during online experiments using the integrated camera and microcontroller. Our AI-powered smart glasses open new opportunities for visual perception of human-robot walking environments where embedded inference and a low form factor is required. Future research will focus on improving the onboard inference speed and miniaturization of the mechatronic components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zinc finger (ZNF) proteins represent the largest group of regulatory proteins within eukaryotic genomes. However, despite their broad regulatory function, the majority of ZNF protein function remains unknown. Recently, we discovered ZNF865, which has no in-depth publications and has not been functionally characterized. Utilizing CRISPR-guided gene modulation, we show that ZNF865 regulates key cellular and molecular processes associated with healthy cell function by primarily regulating cellular senescence, cell cycle progression, and protein processing. As a result, regulating this gene acts as a primary titratable regulator of cell activity, and we demonstrate the potential of targeted ZNF865 regulation as a tool to control senescence and protein production in multiple clinically relevant cell types for cell engineering/tissue engineering/gene therapy applications. We demonstrate its ability to rescue human senescent cell populations, boost T-cell activity, and dramatically deposit more cartilaginous tissue in a whole organ tissue-engineered intervertebral disc. Overall, we present novel biology and regulatory mechanisms of senescence and cell cycle that were previously unknown and display the power of CRISPR-cell engineering to enhance cell engineering strategies treating disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Focused ultrasound stimulation of microbubbles is being tested in clinical trials for its ability to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This technique has the potential to treat neurological diseases by preferentially delivering drugs to targeted regions. Yet despite its potential, the physical mechanisms by which microbubbles alter the BBB permeability remain unclear, as direct observations of microbubbles oscillating in cerebral capillaries have never been previously recorded. The purpose of this study was to reveal how microbubbles respond to ultrasound when within the microvessels of living brain tissue. Methods Microbubbles in acute brain slices acquired from juvenile rats perfused with a concentrated solution of SonoVue (Registered Trademark) and dye were exposed to ultrasound pulses typically used in BBB disruption (center frequency: 1 MHz, peak-negative pressure: 0.2-1 MPa, pulse length: up to 10 ms) and observed using high-speed microscopy at up to 10 million frames per second. Results We observed that microbubbles can exert mechanical stresses on a wide region of tissue beyond their initial location and immediate surroundings. A single microbubble can apply mechanical stress to parenchymal tissues several micrometers away from the vessel. Microbubbles can travel at high velocities within the microvessels, extending their influence across tens of micrometers during a single pulse. With longer pulses and higher pressures, microbubbles could penetrate the vessel wall and move through the parenchyma, refuting a previous assumption that microbubbles are confined to vessels. The probability of extravasation scales approximately with mechanical index, being rare at low pressures, but much more common at a mechanical index [&amp;ge;] 0.6. Conclusions These observations provide important insight into microbubble dynamics in microvessels, and are critical leads into ultimately identifying the microbubble activities that lead to both safe drug delivery and into activities we seek to avoid, such as petechiae and other bioeffects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in microRNA-96 (MIR96) cause dominant delayed onset hearing loss DFNA50 without treatment. Genome editing has shown efficacy in hearing recovery by intervention in neonatal mice, yet editing in the adult inner ear is necessary for clinical applications. Here, we developed an editing therapy for a C&gt;A point mutation in the seed region of the Mir96 gene, Mir9614C&gt;A associated with hearing loss by screening gRNAs for genome editors and optimizing Cas9 and sgRNA scaffold for efficient and specific mutation editing in vitro. By AAV delivery in pre-symptomatic (3-week-old) and symptomatic (6-week-old) adult Mir9614C&gt;A mutant mice, hair cell on-target editing significantly improved hearing long-term, with an efficacy inversely correlated with injection age. We achieved transient Cas9 expression without the evidence of AAV genomic integration to significantly reduce the safety concerns associated with editing. We developed an AAV-sgmiR96-master system capable of targeting all known human MIR96 mutations. As mouse and human MIR96 sequences share 100% homology, our approach and sgRNA selection for efficient and specific hair cell editing for long-term hearing recovery lays the foundation for future treatment of DFNA50 caused by MIR96 mutations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Generating 3D bone cell networks in vitro that accurately mimic the dynamic process of osteoblast embedding during early bone formation poses a significant challenge. Herein, we report a synthetic biodegradable macroporous hydrogel for efficient formation of 3D networks from human primary cells, analysis of cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) and microfluidic integration. Using polymerization-induced phase separation, matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive polyethylene glycol hydrogels are formed with interconnected porosity in the presence of living cells. The pore size (5-20 m) and permeability can be fine-tuned by adjusting the concentration and molecular weight of dextran. After encapsulation in these hydrogels, human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts form a 3D cell network within 24 hours. The synthetic nature of this hydrogel enables histological analysis of cell-secreted collagen, a task previously challenging using collagen-derived hydrogels. Moreover, this hydrogel is integrated with a commercial chip, showcasing the potential for microfluidic perfusion cultures. Time-lapsed imaging of fluid flow and fast formation of 3D cell networks is demonstrated on chip. Altogether, this work introduces a versatile synthetic macroporous hydrogel, which can be integrated with microfluidic chip to enable 3D culture of human bone cell networks and analysis of cell-secreted ECM. This hydrogel may facilitate future mechanistic studies on bone development.</p>
