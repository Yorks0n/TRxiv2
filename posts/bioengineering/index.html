H.-M.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564206\nAdipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that can signal bidirectionally to many tissues and organ systems in the body. With obesity, adipose tissue is a source of low-level inflammation that contributes to various co-morbidities and damage to downstream effector tissues. The ability to synthesize genetically engineered adipose tissue could have critical applications in studying adipokine signaling and the use of adipose tissue for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to develop a method for non-viral adipogenic differentiation of genome-edited murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to test the ability of such cells to engraft in mice in vivo. Designer adipocytes were created from iPSCs, which can be readily genetically engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out or insert individual genes of interest. As a model system for adipocyte-based drug delivery, an existing iPSC cell line that transcribes interleukin 1 receptor antagonist under the endogenous macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 promoter was tested for adipogenic capabilities under these same differentiation conditions. To understand the role of various adipocyte subtypes and their impact on health and disease, an efficient method was devised for inducing browning and whitening of IPSC-derived adipocytes in culture. Finally, to study the downstream effects of designer adipocytes in vivo, we transplanted the designer adipocytes into fat-free lipodystrophic mice as a model system for studying adipose signaling in different models of disease or repair. This novel translational tissue engineering and regenerative medicine platform provides an innovative approach to studying the role of adipose interorgan communication in various conditions.\nMolecular de-extinction of antibiotics enabled by deep learning\nAuthors: Wan, F.; Torres, M. D. T.; Peng, J.; de la Fuente, C.\nScore: 96.8, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560353\nMolecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the \"extinctome\") searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.\nHighly-parallel production of designer organoids by mosaic patterning of progenitors\nAuthors: Porter, C. M.; Qian, G. C.; Grindel, S. H.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.564017\nHuman organoids are a promising approach for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, organoid variability and limited control over morphological outcomes remain significant challenges. Here we extend a DNA 'velcro' cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells. We demonstrate long-term control over organoid size and morphology, decoupled from geometric constraints.\nLow-cost camera-based estrous tracking enables transgenesis in Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease\nAuthors: Buchthal, J.; Chory, E.

M.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563285\nCRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the production of animal models by reducing experimental timelines, slashing costs and streamlining gene editing, leading to a rapid expansion in the number of unique models for the study of human disease and gene function. However, most non-model animals, many of which are important in cancer and aging research, remain recalcitrant to genome engineering due to our limited understanding of their reproductive biology. Many wild rodents that transmit human diseases remain particularly challenging to engineer due to low pregnancy rates, the lack of external copulatory plugs, and susceptibility to premature termination of pregnancy. Here, we present low-cost activity-based estrous tracking for the efficient generation of timed pregnant and pseudopregnant white-footed mice and extend this tracking method to both lab mice and hamsters. Leveraging this technology, we demonstrate the generation of engineered Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease-causing bacteria and a putative model organism for studies of aging. These tools have broad implications for biomedical research and ecological engineering.

A.; Rauh, J. L.; Ellison, M. A.; Cruz-Diaz, N.; Yamaleyeva, L. M.; Welch, C. D.; Zeller, K. A.; Weis, V. G.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563296\nBackgroundNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often-lethal disease of the premature infants intestinal tract that is exacerbated by significant difficulties in early and accurate diagnosis. In NEC disease, the intestine often exhibits hypoperfusion and dysmotility, which contributes to advanced disease pathogenesis. However, these physiological features cannot be accurately and quantitively assessed within the current constraints of imaging modalities frequently used in the clinic (plain film X-ray and ultrasound). We have previously demonstrated the ability of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to non-invasively and quantitively assess intestinal tissue oxygenation and motility in a healthy neonatal rat model. As a first-in-disease application, we evaluated NEC pathogenesis using PAI to assess intestinal health biomarkers in a preclinical neonatal rat experimental model of NEC. MethodsNEC was induced in neonatal rat pups from birth to 4 days old via hypertonic formula feeding, full-body hypoxic stress, and lipopolysaccharide administration to mimic bacterial colonization. Healthy breastfed (BF) controls and NEC rat pups were imaged at 2- and 4-days old. Intestinal tissue oxygen saturation was measured with PAI imaging for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin levels. To measure intestinal motility, ultrasound and co-registered PAI cine recordings were used to capture intestinal peristalsis motion and contrast agent (indocyanine green) transit within the intestinal lumen. Additionally, both midplane two-dimensional and volumetric three-dimensional imaging acquisitions were assessed for oxygenation and motility. ResultsNEC pups showed a significant decrease of intestinal tissue oxygenation as compared to healthy BF controls at both ages (2-days old: 55.90% +/-3.77% vs 44.12% +/-7.18%; 4-days old: 56.13% +/-3.52% vs 38.86% +/-8.33%). Intestinal motility, assessed using a computational intestinal deformation analysis, demonstrated a significant reduction in the intestinal motility index in both early (2-day) and established (4-day) NEC. Extensive NEC damage was confirmed with histology and dysmotility was confirmed by small intestinal transit assay. ConclusionsThis study presents PAI as a successful emerging diagnostic imaging modality for both intestinal tissue oxygenation and intestinal motility disease hallmarks in a rat NEC model. PAI presents enormous significance and potential for fundamentally changing current clinical paradigms for detecting and monitoring intestinal pathologies in the premature infant.\nDeveloping small Cas9 hybrids using molecular modeling\nAuthors: Mangin, A.; Dion, V.; Menzies, G.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563270\nThe RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best characterized enzyme for gene editing. Its large size, however, precludes it from being packaged together with its single guide (sg)RNA into a single adeno-associated virus, limiting in vivo applications. Here, we developed smaller Cas9 hybrids, made of the PAM interacting domain (PID) of S pyogenes and the catalytic domains of the smaller Cas9 orthologues, as well as sgRNA cognate hybrids. Molecular modeling revealed that the presence of a sgRNA stabilizes Cas9. Making the D10A mutation to turn Cas9 into a nickase dramatically alters its binding energy to the sgRNA, showing that the approach can identify functionally relevant changes. However, we found that the four Cas9/sgRNA hybrid pairs tested in human cells failed to edit target sequences. We conclude that in silico approaches can identify functional changes caused by point mutations but they may not be well suited for designing Cas9/sgRNA hybrids.\nMatrix architecture and mechanics regulate myofibril organization, costamere assembly, and contractility of engineered myocardial microtissues\nAuthors: DePalma, S. J.; Jillberto, J.; Stis, A. E.; Huang, D. D.; Lo, J.; Davidson, C. D.; Chowdhury, A.; Jewett, M. E.; Kobeissi, H.; Chen, C. S.; Lejeune, E.; Helms, A. S.; Nordsletten, D. A.; Baker, B.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563346\nThe mechanical function of the myocardium is defined by cardiomyocyte contractility and the biomechanics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding this relationship remains an important unmet challenge due to limitations in existing approaches for engineering myocardial tissue. Here, we established arrays of cardiac microtissues with tunable mechanics and architecture by integrating ECM-mimetic synthetic, fiber matrices and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), enabling real-time contractility readouts, in-depth structural assessment, and tissue-specific computational modeling. We find that the stiffness and alignment of matrix fibers distinctly affect the structural development and contractile function of pure iPSC-CM tissues. Further examination into the impact of fibrous matrix stiffness enabled by computational models and quantitative immunofluorescence implicates cell-ECM interactions in myofibril assembly and notably costamere assembly, which correlates with improved contractile function of tissues. These results highlight how iPSC-CM tissue models with controllable architecture and mechanics can inform the design of translatable regenerative cardiac therapies.\nTargeted genome editing restores auditory function in adult mice with progressive hearing loss caused by a human microRNA mutation\nAuthors: Zhu, W.; Du, W.; Rameshbabu, A. P.; Armstrong, A. M.; Silver, S.; Kim, Y.; Wei, W.; Shu, Y.; Liu, X.; Lewis, M. A.; Steel, K. P.; Chen, Z.-Y.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564008\nMutations in microRNA-96 (MIR96) cause dominant delayed onset hearing loss DFNA50 without treatment. Genome editing has shown efficacy in hearing recovery by intervention in neonatal mice, yet editing in the adult inner ear is necessary for clinical applications. Here, we developed an editing therapy for a C\u003eA point mutation in the seed region of the Mir96 gene, Mir9614C\u003eA associated with hearing loss by screening gRNAs for genome editors and optimizing Cas9 and sgRNA scaffold for efficient and specific mutation editing in vitro. By AAV delivery in pre-symptomatic (3-week-old) and symptomatic (6-week-old) adult Mir9614C\u003eA mutant mice, hair cell on-target editing significantly improved hearing long-term, with an efficacy inversely correlated with injection age. We achieved transient Cas9 expression without the evidence of AAV genomic integration to significantly reduce the safety concerns associated with editing. We developed an AAV-sgmiR96-master system capable of targeting all known human MIR96 mutations. As mouse and human MIR96 sequences share 100% homology, our approach and sgRNA selection for efficient and specific hair cell editing for long-term hearing recovery lays the foundation for future treatment of DFNA50 caused by MIR96 mutations.\nDetection of Blood Volume Reduction and Vasoconstriction Following Focused Ultrasound Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Using Ultrasound Flow Imaging\nAuthors: Bae, S.; Lee, S. A.; Konofagou, E. E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563176\nMicrobubble-mediated focused ultrasound (FUS) offers a non-invasive treatment for transient and localized blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening for drug delivery or immunostimulation. It is known that FUS-induced BBB opening is accompanied by blood flow changes, vasoconstriction, and vasodilation, as validated by optical microscopy through a cranial window. In this study, we introduce a novel method for quantifying vascular changes after FUS-induced BBB opening by employing ultrasound flow imaging in mice. We acquired pre-FUS and post-FUS ultrasound flow images with the same microbubble concentration in the brain. Contrast-enhanced power Doppler (CEPD) images and ultrasound localization microscopy images were obtained to evaluate changes in cerebral blood volume and vessel diameter at the sonicated region of the brain. Our findings demonstrate that FUS leads to a reduction in blood volume at the treated region, with vasoconstriction being more dominant than vasodilation. Furthermore, we show that transcranial CEPD can detect local blood reduction following FUS, which spatially coincides with the edema region identified in T2-weighted MRI. Our findings suggest that ultrasound flow imaging has the potential to serve as a cost-effective and immediate monitoring tool for evaluating the safety and efficacy of FUS-induced BBB opening.\nThiolation-Based Protein-Protein Hydrogels for Improved Wound Healing\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Wang, J.; Guo, Z.; Shen, W.; Jia, Z.; Shuang, J.; Li, L.; Wang, J.; Wang, L.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Sun, Y.; Zhang, M.; Bai, J.; Wang, L.; Li, X.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563054\nThe limitations of protein-based hydrogels, including their insufficient mechanical properties and restricted biological functions, arise from the highly specific functions of proteins as natural building blocks. A potential solution to overcome these shortcomings is the development of protein-protein hydrogels, which integrate structural and functional proteins. In this study, we introduce a protein-protein hydrogel formed by crosslinking bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a genetically engineered intrinsically disordered collagen-like protein (CLP) through Ag-S bonding. Our approach involves thiolating lysine residues of BSA and crosslinking CLP with Ag+ ions, utilizing thiolation of BSA and the free-cysteines of CLP. The resulting protein-protein hydrogels exhibit exceptional properties, including notable plasticity, inherent self-healing capabilities, and gel-sol transition in response to redox conditions. Furthermore, in comparison to standalone BSA hydrogels, these protein-protein hydrogels demonstrate remarkable antibacterial properties, enhanced cellular viability, and improved cellular migration. In vivo experiments provide conclusive evidence of accelerated wound healing, observed not only in murine models with streptozotocin (Step)-induced diabetes but also in zebrafish models subjected to UV-burn injuries. Detailed mechanistic insights, combined with assessments of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of epidermal differentiation-related proteins, robustly validate the protein-protein hydrogels effectiveness in promoting wound repair. This pioneering approach advances the development of protein-protein hydrogels and serves as a reference for the creation of multifunctional protein-based hydrogels.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that can signal bidirectionally to many tissues and organ systems in the body. With obesity, adipose tissue is a source of low-level inflammation that contributes to various co-morbidities and damage to downstream effector tissues. The ability to synthesize genetically engineered adipose tissue could have critical applications in studying adipokine signaling and the use of adipose tissue for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to develop a method for non-viral adipogenic differentiation of genome-edited murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to test the ability of such cells to engraft in mice in vivo. Designer adipocytes were created from iPSCs, which can be readily genetically engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out or insert individual genes of interest. As a model system for adipocyte-based drug delivery, an existing iPSC cell line that transcribes interleukin 1 receptor antagonist under the endogenous macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 promoter was tested for adipogenic capabilities under these same differentiation conditions. To understand the role of various adipocyte subtypes and their impact on health and disease, an efficient method was devised for inducing browning and whitening of IPSC-derived adipocytes in culture. Finally, to study the downstream effects of designer adipocytes in vivo, we transplanted the designer adipocytes into fat-free lipodystrophic mice as a model system for studying adipose signaling in different models of disease or repair. This novel translational tissue engineering and regenerative medicine platform provides an innovative approach to studying the role of adipose interorgan communication in various conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the &#34;extinctome&#34;) searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.</p>

However, organoid variability and limited control over morphological outcomes remain significant challenges. Here we extend a DNA &#39;velcro&#39; cell patterning approach, precisely controlling the number and ratio of human stem cell-derived progenitors contributing to nephron and mosaic nephron/ureteric bud organoids within arrays of microwells.

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the production of animal models by reducing experimental timelines, slashing costs and streamlining gene editing, leading to a rapid expansion in the number of unique models for the study of human disease and gene function. However, most non-model animals, many of which are important in cancer and aging research, remain recalcitrant to genome engineering due to our limited understanding of their reproductive biology. Many wild rodents that transmit human diseases remain particularly challenging to engineer due to low pregnancy rates, the lack of external copulatory plugs, and susceptibility to premature termination of pregnancy. Here, we present low-cost activity-based estrous tracking for the efficient generation of timed pregnant and pseudopregnant white-footed mice and extend this tracking method to both lab mice and hamsters. Leveraging this technology, we demonstrate the generation of engineered Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease-causing bacteria and a putative model organism for studies of aging. These tools have broad implications for biomedical research and ecological engineering.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often-lethal disease of the premature infants intestinal tract that is exacerbated by significant difficulties in early and accurate diagnosis. In NEC disease, the intestine often exhibits hypoperfusion and dysmotility, which contributes to advanced disease pathogenesis. However, these physiological features cannot be accurately and quantitively assessed within the current constraints of imaging modalities frequently used in the clinic (plain film X-ray and ultrasound). We have previously demonstrated the ability of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to non-invasively and quantitively assess intestinal tissue oxygenation and motility in a healthy neonatal rat model. As a first-in-disease application, we evaluated NEC pathogenesis using PAI to assess intestinal health biomarkers in a preclinical neonatal rat experimental model of NEC.

MethodsNEC was induced in neonatal rat pups from birth to 4 days old via hypertonic formula feeding, full-body hypoxic stress, and lipopolysaccharide administration to mimic bacterial colonization. Healthy breastfed (BF) controls and NEC rat pups were imaged at 2- and 4-days old. Intestinal tissue oxygen saturation was measured with PAI imaging for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin levels. To measure intestinal motility, ultrasound and co-registered PAI cine recordings were used to capture intestinal peristalsis motion and contrast agent (indocyanine green) transit within the intestinal lumen. Additionally, both midplane two-dimensional and volumetric three-dimensional imaging acquisitions were assessed for oxygenation and motility.

ResultsNEC pups showed a significant decrease of intestinal tissue oxygenation as compared to healthy BF controls at both ages (2-days old: 55.90% &#43;/-3.77% vs 44.12% &#43;/-7.18%; 4-days old: 56.13% &#43;/-3.52% vs 38.86% &#43;/-8.33%). Intestinal motility, assessed using a computational intestinal deformation analysis, demonstrated a significant reduction in the intestinal motility index in both early (2-day) and established (4-day) NEC. Extensive NEC damage was confirmed with histology and dysmotility was confirmed by small intestinal transit assay.

ConclusionsThis study presents PAI as a successful emerging diagnostic imaging modality for both intestinal tissue oxygenation and intestinal motility disease hallmarks in a rat NEC model. PAI presents enormous significance and potential for fundamentally changing current clinical paradigms for detecting and monitoring intestinal pathologies in the premature infant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best characterized enzyme for gene editing. Its large size, however, precludes it from being packaged together with its single guide (sg)RNA into a single adeno-associated virus, limiting in vivo applications. Here, we developed smaller Cas9 hybrids, made of the PAM interacting domain (PID) of S pyogenes and the catalytic domains of the smaller Cas9 orthologues, as well as sgRNA cognate hybrids. Molecular modeling revealed that the presence of a sgRNA stabilizes Cas9. Making the D10A mutation to turn Cas9 into a nickase dramatically alters its binding energy to the sgRNA, showing that the approach can identify functionally relevant changes. However, we found that the four Cas9/sgRNA hybrid pairs tested in human cells failed to edit target sequences. We conclude that in silico approaches can identify functional changes caused by point mutations but they may not be well suited for designing Cas9/sgRNA hybrids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanical function of the myocardium is defined by cardiomyocyte contractility and the biomechanics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding this relationship remains an important unmet challenge due to limitations in existing approaches for engineering myocardial tissue. Here, we established arrays of cardiac microtissues with tunable mechanics and architecture by integrating ECM-mimetic synthetic, fiber matrices and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), enabling real-time contractility readouts, in-depth structural assessment, and tissue-specific computational modeling. We find that the stiffness and alignment of matrix fibers distinctly affect the structural development and contractile function of pure iPSC-CM tissues. Further examination into the impact of fibrous matrix stiffness enabled by computational models and quantitative immunofluorescence implicates cell-ECM interactions in myofibril assembly and notably costamere assembly, which correlates with improved contractile function of tissues. These results highlight how iPSC-CM tissue models with controllable architecture and mechanics can inform the design of translatable regenerative cardiac therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in microRNA-96 (MIR96) cause dominant delayed onset hearing loss DFNA50 without treatment. Genome editing has shown efficacy in hearing recovery by intervention in neonatal mice, yet editing in the adult inner ear is necessary for clinical applications. Here, we developed an editing therapy for a C&gt;A point mutation in the seed region of the Mir96 gene, Mir9614C&gt;A associated with hearing loss by screening gRNAs for genome editors and optimizing Cas9 and sgRNA scaffold for efficient and specific mutation editing in vitro. By AAV delivery in pre-symptomatic (3-week-old) and symptomatic (6-week-old) adult Mir9614C&gt;A mutant mice, hair cell on-target editing significantly improved hearing long-term, with an efficacy inversely correlated with injection age. We achieved transient Cas9 expression without the evidence of AAV genomic integration to significantly reduce the safety concerns associated with editing. We developed an AAV-sgmiR96-master system capable of targeting all known human MIR96 mutations. As mouse and human MIR96 sequences share 100% homology, our approach and sgRNA selection for efficient and specific hair cell editing for long-term hearing recovery lays the foundation for future treatment of DFNA50 caused by MIR96 mutations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbubble-mediated focused ultrasound (FUS) offers a non-invasive treatment for transient and localized blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening for drug delivery or immunostimulation. It is known that FUS-induced BBB opening is accompanied by blood flow changes, vasoconstriction, and vasodilation, as validated by optical microscopy through a cranial window. In this study, we introduce a novel method for quantifying vascular changes after FUS-induced BBB opening by employing ultrasound flow imaging in mice. We acquired pre-FUS and post-FUS ultrasound flow images with the same microbubble concentration in the brain. Contrast-enhanced power Doppler (CEPD) images and ultrasound localization microscopy images were obtained to evaluate changes in cerebral blood volume and vessel diameter at the sonicated region of the brain. Our findings demonstrate that FUS leads to a reduction in blood volume at the treated region, with vasoconstriction being more dominant than vasodilation. Furthermore, we show that transcranial CEPD can detect local blood reduction following FUS, which spatially coincides with the edema region identified in T2-weighted MRI. Our findings suggest that ultrasound flow imaging has the potential to serve as a cost-effective and immediate monitoring tool for evaluating the safety and efficacy of FUS-induced BBB opening.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The limitations of protein-based hydrogels, including their insufficient mechanical properties and restricted biological functions, arise from the highly specific functions of proteins as natural building blocks. A potential solution to overcome these shortcomings is the development of protein-protein hydrogels, which integrate structural and functional proteins. In this study, we introduce a protein-protein hydrogel formed by crosslinking bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a genetically engineered intrinsically disordered collagen-like protein (CLP) through Ag-S bonding. Our approach involves thiolating lysine residues of BSA and crosslinking CLP with Ag&#43; ions, utilizing thiolation of BSA and the free-cysteines of CLP. The resulting protein-protein hydrogels exhibit exceptional properties, including notable plasticity, inherent self-healing capabilities, and gel-sol transition in response to redox conditions. Furthermore, in comparison to standalone BSA hydrogels, these protein-protein hydrogels demonstrate remarkable antibacterial properties, enhanced cellular viability, and improved cellular migration. In vivo experiments provide conclusive evidence of accelerated wound healing, observed not only in murine models with streptozotocin (Step)-induced diabetes but also in zebrafish models subjected to UV-burn injuries. Detailed mechanistic insights, combined with assessments of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of epidermal differentiation-related proteins, robustly validate the protein-protein hydrogels effectiveness in promoting wound repair. This pioneering approach advances the development of protein-protein hydrogels and serves as a reference for the creation of multifunctional protein-based hydrogels.</p>
