E.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575860\nBiomolecular condensates are broadly implicated in both normal cellular regulation and disease. Consequently, several chemical biology and optogenetic approaches have been developed to induce phase separation of a protein of interest. However, few tools are available to perform the converse function--dissolving a condensate of interest on demand. Such a tool would aid in testing whether the condensate plays specific functional roles, a major question in cell biology and drug development. Here we report an optogenetic approach to selectively dissolve a condensate of interest in a reversible and spatially controlled manner. We show that light-gated recruitment of maltose-binding protein (MBP), a commonly used solubilizing domain in protein purification, results in rapid and controlled dissolution of condensates formed from proteins of interest. Our optogenetic MBP-based dissolution strategy (OptoMBP) is rapid, reversible, and can be spatially controlled with subcellular precision. We also provide a proof-of-principle application of OptoMBP, showing that disrupting condensation of the oncogenic fusion protein FUS-CHOP results in reversion of FUS-CHOP driven transcriptional changes. We envision that the OptoMBP system could be broadly useful for disrupting constitutive protein condensates to probe their biological functions.\nSaponin Nanoparticle Adjuvants Incorporating Toll-Like Receptor Agonists Improve Vaccine Immunomodulation\nAuthors: Ou, B. S.; Baillet, J.; Filsinger Interrante, M. V.; Adamska, J. Z.; Zhou, X.; Saouaf, O.; Yan, J.; Klich, J.; Jons, C. K.; Meany, E.; Valdez, A. S.; Carter, L.; Pulendran, B.; King, N. P.; Appel, E.\nScore: 149.2, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549249\nOver the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.\nLogic-based modeling of biological networks with Netflux\nAuthors: Clark, A. P.; Chowkwale, M.; Paap, A.; Dang, S.; Saucerman, J. J.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575227\nMolecular signaling networks drive a diverse range of cellular decisions, including whether to proliferate, how and when to die, and many processes in between. Such networks often connect hundreds of proteins, genes, and processes. Understanding these complex networks is greatly aided by computational modeling, but these tools require extensive programming knowledge. In this article, we describe a user-friendly, programming-free network simulation tool called Netflux (https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux). Over the last decade, Netflux has been used to construct numerous predictive network models that have deepened our understanding of how complex biological networks make cell decisions. Here, we provide a Netflux tutorial that covers how to construct a network model and then simulate network responses to perturbations. Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be able to construct your own model in Netflux and simulate how perturbations to proteins and genes propagate through signaling and gene-regulatory networks.\nSimple visualization of submicroscopic protein clusters with a phase-separation-based fluorescent reporter.\nAuthors: Mumford, T. R.; Rae, D.; Brackhahn, E.; Idris, A.; Gonzalez-Martinez, D.; Pal, A. A.; Chung, M. C.; Guan, J.; Rhoades, E.; Bugaj, L. J.\nScore: 50.8, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.13.499962\nProtein clustering plays numerous roles in cell physiology and disease. However, protein oligomers can be difficult to detect because they are often too small to appear as puncta in conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a fluorescent reporter strategy that detects protein clusters with high sensitivity, called CluMPS (Clusters Magnified by Phase Separation). A CluMPS reporter detects and visually amplifies even small clusters of a binding partner, generating large, quantifiable fluorescence condensates. We use computational modeling and optogenetic clustering to demonstrate that CluMPS can detect small oligomers and behaves rationally according to key system parameters. CluMPS detected small aggregates of pathological proteins where the corresponding GFP fusions appeared diffuse. CluMPS also detected and tracked clusters of unmodified and tagged endogenous proteins, and orthogonal CluMPS probes could be multiplexed in cells. CluMPS provides a powerful yet straightforward approach to observe higher-order protein assembly in its native cellular context.\nSwitching to external flows: perturbations of developing vasculature within chicken chorioallantoic membrane\nAuthors: Padmanaban, P.; van Galen, D.; Salehi-Nik, N.; Zakharova, M.; Segerink, L.; Rouwkema, J.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575208\nThe impact of fluid flow shear stresses, generated by the movement of blood through vasculature, on the organization and maturation of vessels is widely recognized. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether external fluid flows outside of the vasculature in the surrounding tissue can similarly play a role in governing these processes. In this research, we introduce an innovative technique called superfusion-induced vascular steering (SIVS). SIVS involves the controlled imposition of external fluid flow patterns onto the vascularized chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), allowing us to observe how this impacts the organization of vascular networks. To investigate the concept of SIVS, we conducted superfusion experiments on the intact chick CAM cultured within engineered eggshell system, using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To capture and analyze the effects of superfusion, we employed a custom-built microscopy setup, enabling us to image both superfused and non-superfused regions within the developing CAM. This study provides valuable insights into the practical application of fluid superfusion within an in vivo context, shedding light on its significance for understanding tissue development and manipulation in an engineering setting.\nEffect of molecular weight of tyramine-modified hyaluronan on polarization state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages\nAuthors: Wychowaniec, J. K.; Bektas, E. I.; Vernengo, A. J.; Mürner, M.; Airoldi, M.; Eglin, D.; D'Este, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575241\nThe immunomodulatory properties of hyaluronan and its derivatives are key to their use in medicine and tissue engineering. In this work we evaluated the capability of soluble tyramine-modified hyaluronan (THA) of two molecular weights (low Mw=280 kDa and high Mw=1640 kDa) for polarization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages. We demonstrate the polarization effects of the supplemented THA by the semi-automated image analysis from confocal microscopy, immunofluorescent staining utilising CD68 and CD206 surface markers, RT-qPCR gene expression analysis, as well as using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of certain cytokines including TNF- (pro-inflammatory), IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and surface marker CD206 are more viable options for rapid screening of polarization states of macrophages with CD206 marker being associated with the lowest donor variability. Our findings indicate that low Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-inflammatory state, M1-like state, whereas high Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-regenerative, M2-like state, and that the extent of these responses are donor-dependent. The variation in the obtained phenotypic responses may stem from possible uncontrolled genetic factors in received blood donor samples. Finally, we confirm the typical association of low versus high molecular weight for THA holds true and stipulate that these responses will provide more accurate in vivo representation and translational immunomodulatory guidance for the use of THA-based biomaterials to a wider biomaterials and tissue engineering communities.

However, across tissue types and species, organoids still often fail to reach full maturity and function, because biochemical cues cannot be provided from within the organoid to guide their development. The establishment of such tools has been identified as a major goal of the field. Here, we introduce DNA microbeads as a novel tool for implementing spatio-temporally controlled morphogen gradients inside of organoids at any point in their life cycle. The DNA microbeads are formed in a simple one-pot process, they can be stored for a year and their viscoelastic behavior and surface modification is tunable to mimic the corresponding tissue. Employing medaka retinal organoids and early embryos, we show that DNA microbeads can be integrated into embryos and organoids by microinjection and erased in a non-invasive manner with light. Coupling a recombinant surrogate Wnt to the DNA microbeads we demonstrate the spatio-temporally controlled release of the morphogen from the microinjection site, which leads to the formation of retinal pigmented epithelium while maintaining neuroretinal ganglion cells. We were thus able to bioengineer retinal organoids to more closely mirror the cell type diversity of in vivo retinas. The DNA microbead technology can easily be adapted to other organoid applications for improved tissue mimicry.\nSafety and efficacy study of CRISPR/Cas9 treatment of sickle cell disease in clinically relevant conditions highlights disease-specific response\nAuthors: Frati, G.; Brusson, M.; Sartre, G.; MLAYAH, B.; FELIX, T.; Chalumeau, A.; Antoniou, P.; Hardouin, G.; Concordet, J.-P.; Romano, O.; Turchiano, G.; Miccio, A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575586\nReactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated disruption of regulatory elements involved in {gamma}-globin gene repression is a promising gene therapy strategy for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, preclinical studies aimed at optimizing the genome editing process and evaluating the safety of the editing strategy are necessary to translate this approach to the clinics. This is particularly relevant in the context of SCD, a disease characterized by inflammation, which can affect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the target cell population in gene therapy approaches for hematopoietic disorders. Here, we describe a genome editing strategy leading to therapeutically relevant reactivation of HbF expression by targeting the binding sites (BSs) for the leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF) transcriptional repressor in the HBG1 and HBG2 {gamma}-globin promoters. Electroporation of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the HBG promoters in healthy donor (HD) and patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a high frequency of LRF BS disruption and potent HbF synthesis in their erythroid progeny differentiated in vitro and ex vivo after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. LRF BS disruption did not impair SCD and HD HSPC engraftment and differentiation, but was more efficient in SCD than in HD cells. However, SCD HSPCs showed a reduced engraftment and a myeloid bias compared to HD cells. Importantly, in primary HSPCs, we detected off-target activity and the intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements between on- and off-target sites, which were more pronounced in SCD samples (likely because of the higher overall editing efficiency), but did not impact the target gene expression. Off-target activity was observed in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that it does not impair engraftment and differentiation of both SCD and HD HSPCs. Finally, transcriptomic analyses showed that the genome editing procedure results in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and inflammatory responses in both HD and SCD samples, although gene dysregulation was more evident in SCD HSPCs. Overall, this study provides evidences of feasibility, efficacy and safety for a genome editing strategy based on HbF reactivation and highlights the need of performing safety studies, when possible, in clinically relevant conditions, i.e., in patient-derived HSPCs.\nA General-Purpose Non-invasive Neurotechnology Research Platform\nAuthors: Schalk, G.; Shao, S.; Xiao, K.; Li, J.; Xie, J.; Guan, Y.; Wu, Z.; Chen, L.; Zhong, X.; Xu, C.; Li, G.; Yu, H.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573494\nThis article describes our initial work toward a general-purpose platform for non-invasive neurotechnology research. This platform consists of a multi-modal wireless recording device, an associated software API, and full integration into BCI2000 software. The device is placed on the forehead and features two electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors, an inertial movement sensor (IMU), a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, a microphone, and vibration-based feedback. Herein, we demonstrate different technical characteristics of our platform and its use in the context of sleep monitoring/modulation, simultaneous and synchronized recordings from different hardware, and evoked potentials. With further development and widespread dissemination, our platform could become an important tool for research into new non-invasive neurotechnology protocols in humans.\nMitigating reactive oxygen species production and increasing gel porosity improves lymphocyte motility and fibroblast spreading in photocrosslinked gelatin-thiol hydrogels\nAuthors: Ozulumba, T.; Zatorski, J. M.; Arneja, A.; Hammel, J. H.; Braciale, T. J.; Luckey, C. J.; Munson, J. M.; Pompano, R. R.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.574282\nOn-chip 3D culture systems that incorporate immune cells such as lymphocytes and stromal cells are needed to model immune organs in engineered systems such as organs-on-chip. Photocrosslinking is a useful tool for creating such immune-competent hydrogel cultures with spatial cell organization. However, loss of viability and motility in photocrosslinked gels can limit its utility, especially when working with fragile primary cells. We hypothesized that optimizing photoexposure-induced ROS production, hydrogel porosity or a combination of both factors was necessary to sustain cell viability and motility during culture in photocrosslinked gelatin-thiol (GelSH) hydrogels. Jurkat T cells, primary human CD4+ T cells and human lymphatic fibroblasts were selected as representative lymphoid immune cells to test this hypothesis. Direct exposure of these cells to 385 nm light and LAP photoinitiator dramatically increased ROS levels. Pretreatment with an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (AA), protected the cells from light + LAP-induced ROS and was non-toxic at optimized doses. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy showed that native GelSH hydrogels had limited porosity, and that adding collagen to GelSH precursor before crosslinking markedly increased gel porosity. Next, we tested the impact of AA pretreatment and increasing gel porosity, alone or in combination, on cell viability and function in 3D GelSH hydrogel cultures. Increasing gel porosity, rather than AA pretreatment, was more critical for rescuing viability of Jurkat T cells and spreading of human lymphatic fibroblasts in GelSH-based gels, but both factors improved the motility of primary human CD4+ T cells. Increased porosity enabled formation of spatially organized co-cultures of primary human CD4+ T cells and human lymphatic fibroblasts in photo-crosslinked gels in a multi-lane microfluidic chip, towards modeling the lymphoid organ microenvironment. Some optimization is still needed to improve homogeneity between regions on the chip. These findings will enable researchers utilizing photocrosslinking methods to develop immunocompetent 3D culture models that support viability and function of sensitive lymphoid cells.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Biomolecular condensates are broadly implicated in both normal cellular regulation and disease. Consequently, several chemical biology and optogenetic approaches have been developed to induce phase separation of a protein of interest. However, few tools are available to perform the converse function--dissolving a condensate of interest on demand. Such a tool would aid in testing whether the condensate plays specific functional roles, a major question in cell biology and drug development. Here we report an optogenetic approach to selectively dissolve a condensate of interest in a reversible and spatially controlled manner. We show that light-gated recruitment of maltose-binding protein (MBP), a commonly used solubilizing domain in protein purification, results in rapid and controlled dissolution of condensates formed from proteins of interest. Our optogenetic MBP-based dissolution strategy (OptoMBP) is rapid, reversible, and can be spatially controlled with subcellular precision. We also provide a proof-of-principle application of OptoMBP, showing that disrupting condensation of the oncogenic fusion protein FUS-CHOP results in reversion of FUS-CHOP driven transcriptional changes. We envision that the OptoMBP system could be broadly useful for disrupting constitutive protein condensates to probe their biological functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular signaling networks drive a diverse range of cellular decisions, including whether to proliferate, how and when to die, and many processes in between. Such networks often connect hundreds of proteins, genes, and processes. Understanding these complex networks is greatly aided by computational modeling, but these tools require extensive programming knowledge. In this article, we describe a user-friendly, programming-free network simulation tool called Netflux (https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux). Over the last decade, Netflux has been used to construct numerous predictive network models that have deepened our understanding of how complex biological networks make cell decisions. Here, we provide a Netflux tutorial that covers how to construct a network model and then simulate network responses to perturbations. Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be able to construct your own model in Netflux and simulate how perturbations to proteins and genes propagate through signaling and gene-regulatory networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein clustering plays numerous roles in cell physiology and disease. However, protein oligomers can be difficult to detect because they are often too small to appear as puncta in conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a fluorescent reporter strategy that detects protein clusters with high sensitivity, called CluMPS (Clusters Magnified by Phase Separation). A CluMPS reporter detects and visually amplifies even small clusters of a binding partner, generating large, quantifiable fluorescence condensates. We use computational modeling and optogenetic clustering to demonstrate that CluMPS can detect small oligomers and behaves rationally according to key system parameters. CluMPS detected small aggregates of pathological proteins where the corresponding GFP fusions appeared diffuse. CluMPS also detected and tracked clusters of unmodified and tagged endogenous proteins, and orthogonal CluMPS probes could be multiplexed in cells. CluMPS provides a powerful yet straightforward approach to observe higher-order protein assembly in its native cellular context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of fluid flow shear stresses, generated by the movement of blood through vasculature, on the organization and maturation of vessels is widely recognized. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether external fluid flows outside of the vasculature in the surrounding tissue can similarly play a role in governing these processes. In this research, we introduce an innovative technique called superfusion-induced vascular steering (SIVS). SIVS involves the controlled imposition of external fluid flow patterns onto the vascularized chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), allowing us to observe how this impacts the organization of vascular networks. To investigate the concept of SIVS, we conducted superfusion experiments on the intact chick CAM cultured within engineered eggshell system, using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To capture and analyze the effects of superfusion, we employed a custom-built microscopy setup, enabling us to image both superfused and non-superfused regions within the developing CAM. This study provides valuable insights into the practical application of fluid superfusion within an in vivo context, shedding light on its significance for understanding tissue development and manipulation in an engineering setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immunomodulatory properties of hyaluronan and its derivatives are key to their use in medicine and tissue engineering. In this work we evaluated the capability of soluble tyramine-modified hyaluronan (THA) of two molecular weights (low Mw=280 kDa and high Mw=1640 kDa) for polarization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages. We demonstrate the polarization effects of the supplemented THA by the semi-automated image analysis from confocal microscopy, immunofluorescent staining utilising CD68 and CD206 surface markers, RT-qPCR gene expression analysis, as well as using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of certain cytokines including TNF- (pro-inflammatory), IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and surface marker CD206 are more viable options for rapid screening of polarization states of macrophages with CD206 marker being associated with the lowest donor variability. Our findings indicate that low Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-inflammatory state, M1-like state, whereas high Mw THA can be associated with mild pro-regenerative, M2-like state, and that the extent of these responses are donor-dependent. The variation in the obtained phenotypic responses may stem from possible uncontrolled genetic factors in received blood donor samples. Finally, we confirm the typical association of low versus high molecular weight for THA holds true and stipulate that these responses will provide more accurate in vivo representation and translational immunomodulatory guidance for the use of THA-based biomaterials to a wider biomaterials and tissue engineering communities.

        <p class="abstract">Organoids have proven to be powerful in vitro model systems that mimic features of the corresponding tissue in vivo. However, across tissue types and species, organoids still often fail to reach full maturity and function, because biochemical cues cannot be provided from within the organoid to guide their development. The establishment of such tools has been identified as a major goal of the field. Here, we introduce DNA microbeads as a novel tool for implementing spatio-temporally controlled morphogen gradients inside of organoids at any point in their life cycle. The DNA microbeads are formed in a simple one-pot process, they can be stored for a year and their viscoelastic behavior and surface modification is tunable to mimic the corresponding tissue. Employing medaka retinal organoids and early embryos, we show that DNA microbeads can be integrated into embryos and organoids by microinjection and erased in a non-invasive manner with light. Coupling a recombinant surrogate Wnt to the DNA microbeads we demonstrate the spatio-temporally controlled release of the morphogen from the microinjection site, which leads to the formation of retinal pigmented epithelium while maintaining neuroretinal ganglion cells. We were thus able to bioengineer retinal organoids to more closely mirror the cell type diversity of in vivo retinas. The DNA microbead technology can easily be adapted to other organoid applications for improved tissue mimicry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated disruption of regulatory elements involved in {gamma}-globin gene repression is a promising gene therapy strategy for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, preclinical studies aimed at optimizing the genome editing process and evaluating the safety of the editing strategy are necessary to translate this approach to the clinics. This is particularly relevant in the context of SCD, a disease characterized by inflammation, which can affect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the target cell population in gene therapy approaches for hematopoietic disorders.

Here, we describe a genome editing strategy leading to therapeutically relevant reactivation of HbF expression by targeting the binding sites (BSs) for the leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF) transcriptional repressor in the HBG1 and HBG2 {gamma}-globin promoters. Electroporation of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the HBG promoters in healthy donor (HD) and patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a high frequency of LRF BS disruption and potent HbF synthesis in their erythroid progeny differentiated in vitro and ex vivo after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. LRF BS disruption did not impair SCD and HD HSPC engraftment and differentiation, but was more efficient in SCD than in HD cells. However, SCD HSPCs showed a reduced engraftment and a myeloid bias compared to HD cells.

Importantly, in primary HSPCs, we detected off-target activity and the intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements between on- and off-target sites, which were more pronounced in SCD samples (likely because of the higher overall editing efficiency), but did not impact the target gene expression. Off-target activity was observed in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that it does not impair engraftment and differentiation of both SCD and HD HSPCs. Finally, transcriptomic analyses showed that the genome editing procedure results in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and inflammatory responses in both HD and SCD samples, although gene dysregulation was more evident in SCD HSPCs.

Overall, this study provides evidences of feasibility, efficacy and safety for a genome editing strategy based on HbF reactivation and highlights the need of performing safety studies, when possible, in clinically relevant conditions, i.e., in patient-derived HSPCs.</p>

This platform consists of a multi-modal wireless recording device, an associated software API, and full integration into BCI2000 software. The device is placed on the forehead and features two electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors, an inertial movement sensor (IMU), a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, a microphone, and vibration-based feedback. Herein, we demonstrate different technical characteristics of our platform and its use in the context of sleep monitoring/modulation, simultaneous and synchronized recordings from different hardware, and evoked potentials.

        <p class="abstract">On-chip 3D culture systems that incorporate immune cells such as lymphocytes and stromal cells are needed to model immune organs in engineered systems such as organs-on-chip. Photocrosslinking is a useful tool for creating such immune-competent hydrogel cultures with spatial cell organization. However, loss of viability and motility in photocrosslinked gels can limit its utility, especially when working with fragile primary cells. We hypothesized that optimizing photoexposure-induced ROS production, hydrogel porosity or a combination of both factors was necessary to sustain cell viability and motility during culture in photocrosslinked gelatin-thiol (GelSH) hydrogels. Jurkat T cells, primary human CD4&#43; T cells and human lymphatic fibroblasts were selected as representative lymphoid immune cells to test this hypothesis. Direct exposure of these cells to 385 nm light and LAP photoinitiator dramatically increased ROS levels. Pretreatment with an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (AA), protected the cells from light &#43; LAP-induced ROS and was non-toxic at optimized doses. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy showed that native GelSH hydrogels had limited porosity, and that adding collagen to GelSH precursor before crosslinking markedly increased gel porosity. Next, we tested the impact of AA pretreatment and increasing gel porosity, alone or in combination, on cell viability and function in 3D GelSH hydrogel cultures. Increasing gel porosity, rather than AA pretreatment, was more critical for rescuing viability of Jurkat T cells and spreading of human lymphatic fibroblasts in GelSH-based gels, but both factors improved the motility of primary human CD4&#43; T cells. Increased porosity enabled formation of spatially organized co-cultures of primary human CD4&#43; T cells and human lymphatic fibroblasts in photo-crosslinked gels in a multi-lane microfluidic chip, towards modeling the lymphoid organ microenvironment. Some optimization is still needed to improve homogeneity between regions on the chip. These findings will enable researchers utilizing photocrosslinking methods to develop immunocompetent 3D culture models that support viability and function of sensitive lymphoid cells.</p>
