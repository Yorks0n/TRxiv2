The utilization of such genetically engineered organisms would offer the potential to curtail the necessity for culling animals of undesirable sex, mitigate resource wastage, and alleviate superfluous labor burdens. In this study, we introduce a transgenic male mouse lineage, which consistently yields predominantly female progeny (comprising up to 91% of the total offspring). This accomplishment was made possible by integrating a controllable genetic cassette onto the Y chromosome. The cassette encodes dCas9 and RNA guides that selectively silence a spermatid maturation gene. After the separation of X and Y gametes during meiosis, gametes containing an X chromosome develop normally, while those harboring the engineered Y chromosome, subjected to dCas9 silencing of the spermatid maturation gene, do not mature properly. Indeed, some spermatozoa from the transgenic mice exhibit a unique morphology, associated with the absence of the maturation gene. Notably, the resultant female offspring do not inherit the genetically engineered Y chromosome and are thus not genetically modified. Importantly, the litter size of the transgenic mice remains unchanged compared to the wild type. These findings represent a groundbreaking demonstration of genetic engineerings potential to yield sex-biased litters of full size without compromising genetic integrity, marking a pioneering advancement in this field of study.

To increase its throughput, we developed nPOP, a method for parallel preparation of thousands of single cells in nanoliter volume droplets deposited on glass slides. Here, we describe its protocol with emphasis on its flexibility to prepare samples for different multiplexed MS methods. An implementation with plexDIA demonstrates accurate quantification of about 3,000 - 3,700 proteins per human cell. The protocol is implemented on the CellenONE instrument and uses readily available consumables, which should facilitate broad adoption. nPOP can be applied to all samples that can be processed to a single-cell suspension. It takes 1 or 2 days to prepare over 3,000 single cells. We provide metrics and software for quality control that can support the robust scaling of nPOP to higher plex reagents for achieving reliable high-throughput single-cell protein analysis.\nEngineering self-deliverable ribonucleoproteins for genome editing in the brain\nAuthors: Chen, K.; Stahl, E. C.; Kang, M. H.; Xu, B.; Allen, R.; Trinidad, M.; Doudna, J. A.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567251\nThe delivery of CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for genome editing in vitro and in vivo has important advantages over other delivery methods, including reduced off-target and immunogenic effects1. However, effective delivery of RNPs remains challenging in certain cell types due to low efficiency and cell toxicity. To address these issues, we engineered self-deliverable RNPs that can promote efficient cellular uptake and carry out robust genome editing without the need for helper materials or biomolecules. Screening of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) fused to CRISPR-Cas9 protein identified potent constructs capable of efficient genome editing of neural progenitor cells. Further engineering of these fusion proteins identified a C-terminal Cas9 fusion with three copies of A22p, a peptide derived from human semaphorin-3a, that exhibited substantially improved editing efficacy compared to other constructs. We found that self-deliverable Cas9 RNPs generated robust genome edits in clinically relevant genes when injected directly into the mouse striatum. Overall, self-deliverable Cas9 proteins provide a facile and effective platform for genome editing in vitro and in vivo.\nAt matched loads, aging does not alter ankle, muscle, or tendon stiffness\nAuthors: Jakubowski, K.; Ludvig, D.; Lee, S. S.; Perreault, E. J.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568676\nOlder adults have difficulty maintaining balance when faced with postural disturbances, a task that is influenced by the stiffness of the triceps surae and Achilles tendon. Age-related changes in Achilles tendon stiffness have been reported at matched levels of effort, but measures typically have not been made at matched loads, which is important due to age-dependent changes in strength. Moreover, age-dependent changes in muscle stiffness have yet to be tested. Here, we investigate how age alters muscle and tendon stiffness and their influence on ankle stiffness. We hypothesized that age-related changes in muscle and tendon contribute to reduced ankle stiffness in older adults and evaluated this hypothesis when either load or effort were matched. We used B-mode ultrasound with joint-level perturbations to quantify ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness across a range of loads and efforts in seventeen healthy younger and older adults. At matched loads, there was no significant difference in ankle, muscle, or tendon stiffness between groups (all p\u003e0.13). However, at matched effort, older adults exhibited a significant decrease in ankle (27%; p=0.008), muscle (37%; p=0.02), and tendon stiffness (22%; p=0.03) at 30% of maximum effort. This is consistent with our finding that older adults were 36% weaker than younger adults in plantarflexion (p=0.004). Together these results indicate that, at the loads tested in this study, there are no age-dependent changes in the mechanical properties of muscle or tendon, only differences in strength that result in altered ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness at matched levels of effort. NO_SCPLOWEWC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOW NO_SCPLOWOTEWORTHYC_SCPLOWWe provide the first simultaneous estimates of ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness in younger and older adults. In contrast to earlier conclusions, we found that muscle and tendon mechanical properties are unaffected by age when compared at matched loads. However, due to age-related decreases in strength, mechanical properties do differ at matched efforts. As such, it is important to assess the relevance of the comparisons being made relative to the functional tasks under consideration.\nTuning of granulopoietic signaling by de novo designed agonists\nAuthors: Ullrich, T.; Pollmann, C.; Ritter, M.; Haaf, J.; Aghaallaei, N.; Tesakov, I.; El-Riz, M.; Maksymenko, K.; Hatskovska, V.; Kandabarau, S.; Klimiankou, M.; Lengerke, C.; Welte, K.; Hernandez Alvarez, B.; Müller, P.; Lupas, A.

De novo protein design can serve an excellent tool for tailoring novel cytokine receptor agonists with altered binding affinities and geometries. Here, we report the design and characterization of agonists that tune the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) activity, which is central for the proliferation and granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Selected design agonists were deployed to study the impact of varying the binding affinity and dimerization geometry on receptor association, downstream signaling, and cellular response. Hence, we achieved design agonists with altered signaling specificities that are hyper-thermostable, engage the receptor with tight affinity, and bias granulopoietic differentiation over triggering proliferation. Furthermore, the design agonists modulate the kinetics and amplitudes of signal transduction pathways, yielding differential gene expression patterns. Thus, unlike G-CSF, the design agonists could achieve selective activation of hematopoietic stem cell functions with minimal undesired immunomodulatory effects. These findings demonstrate the potential of dissecting the complexity of G-CSFR signaling, outcompeting the native ligand, and therefore open ways for more specific therapeutic applications.

R.; Krupenevich, R.; Gray, A.; Batsis, J. A.; Sawicki, G. S.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568808\nThe mechanisms responsible for increased walking metabolic cost among older adults are poorly understood. We recently proposed a theoretical premise by which age-related reductions in Achilles tendon stiffness (kAT) can disrupt the neuromechanics of calf muscle behavior and contribute to faster rates of oxygen consumption during walking. The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate this premise. We quantified kAT at a range of matched activations prescribed using electromyographic biofeedback and walking metabolic cost in a group of 15 younger (age: 23{+/-}4 yrs) and 15 older adults (age: 72{+/-}5 yrs). Older adults averaged 44% less kAT than younger adults at matched triceps surae activations (p=0.046). This effect appeared to arise not only from altered tendon length-tension relations with age, but also from differences in the operating region of those length-tension relations between younger and older adults. Older adults also walked with a 17% higher net metabolic power than younger adults (p=0.017). In addition, we discovered empirical evidence that lesser kAT exacts a metabolic penalty and was positively correlated with higher net metabolic power during walking (r=-0.365, p=0.048). These results pave the way for interventions focused on restoring ankle muscle-tendon unit structural stiffness to improve walking energetics in aging.\nPolymer-mediated oligonucleotide delivery enables construction of barcoded 3D cultures for spatial single-cell analysis\nAuthors: King, J. J.; Mowla, A.; Kretzmann, J. A.; Norret, M.; Kadolsky, U. D.; Iqbal, M.; Saxena, A.; Mamsa, S. S. A.; Amos, S. E.; Choi, Y. S.; Kennedy, B. F.; Iyer, K. S.; Smith, N. M.; Evans, C. W.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567985\nSpatial transcriptomics has been widely used to capture gene expression profiles, realised as a two-dimensional (2D) projection of RNA captured from tissue sections. Wree-dimensional (3D) cultures such as spheroids and organoids are highly promising alternatives to oversimplified and homogeneous 2D cell culture models, but existing spatial transcriptomic platforms do not currently have sufficient resolution for robust analysis of 3D cultures. We present a transfection-based method for fluorescent DNA barcoding of cell populations, and the subsequent construction of spheroidal cellular architectures using barcoded cells in a layer-by-layer approach. For the first time, changes in gene expression throughout this 3D culture architecture are interrogated using multiplex single-cell RNA sequencing in which DNA barcodes are used to encode the spatial positioning of cells. We show that transfection with fluorophore-conjugated barcode oligonucleotides enables both imaging and sequencing at single-cell resolution, providing spatial maps of gene expression and drug response. Additionally, we show that fluorophore-conjugated DNA barcodes support correlative imaging studies such as mechano-microscopy to capture information about spatially-varying mechanical heterogeneity in 3D cultures. We ability to create customised, encoded cellular assemblies is a general approach that can resolve spatial differences in gene expression in 3D cell culture models.\nIsogenic iPSC-derived proximal and distal lung-on-chip models: Tissue- and virus-specific immune responses in human lungs\nAuthors: Yadav, S.; Fujimoto, K.; Takenaga, T.; Takahashi, S.; Muramoto, Y.; Mikawa, R.; Noda, T.; Gotoh, S.; Yokokawa, R.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568532\nMicro-physiological systems (MPS) are set to play a vital role in preclinical studies, particularly in the context of future viral pandemics. Nonetheless, the development of MPS is often impeded by the scarcity of reliable cell sources, especially when seeking various organs or tissues from a single patient for comparative analysis of the host immune response. Herein, we developed human airway-on-chip and alveolus-on-chip models using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived isogenic lung progenitor cells. Both models demonstrated the replication of two different respiratory viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza, as well as related cellular damage and innate immune responses-on-chip. Our findings reveal distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the proximal and distal lung-on-chip models. The airway chips exhibited a robust interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, whereas the alveolus chips exhibited dysregulated IFN activation but a significantly upregulated chemokine pathway. In contrast, Influenza virus infection induced a more pronounced immune response and cellular damage in both chip models compared to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, iPSC-derived lung-on-chip models may aid in quickly gaining insights into viral pathology and screening potential drugs for future pandemics.\nOverground walking slip perturbations induce frontal plane motion of the trunk indicating that slips are not just a backwards but also a sideways loss of balance\nAuthors: Lee-Confer, J. S.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568692\nSlip and fall incidents are a serious health care concern globally. Previous research describes a backwards loss of balance during a slip incident, however hip fractures only occur if individuals fall on their side. Therefore, this study is investigating and quantifying the trunk motion in the sagittal and frontal plane. 13 healthy young participants trunk kinematics were analyzed during a slip incident. Peak trunk angle of the trunk in the sagittal and frontal plane were calculated. There was no significant difference between sagittal and frontal plane peak trunk angles suggesting that there is frontal plane motion during an overground slip incident. Our findings suggest research should investigate frontal plane mechanics during a slip incident as there is trunk frontal plane motion which if uncontrolled can result in falling on the femoral neck. Understanding and preventing falls based upon frontal plane mechanics may be more useful for preventing hip fractures from a slip incident. Lastly, the findings of this study are confirmatory results as the frontal plane trunk motion was quantified and reported in 2008.\nForce-mediated recruitment and reprogramming of healthy endothelial cells drive vascular lesion growth\nAuthors: Shapeti, A.; Barrasa Fano, J.; Abdel Fattah, A. R.; de Jong, J.; Sanz-Herrera, J. A.; Pezet, M.; ASSOU, S.; de Vet, E.; Elahi, S. A.; Ranga, A.; Faurobert, E.; Van Oosterwyck, H.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568780\nForce-driven cellular interactions are known to play a critical role in cancer cell invasion, but have remained largely unexplored in the context of vascular abnormalities, partly due to a lack of suitable genetic and cellular models. One such vascular abnormality, cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is characterized by leaky, tumor-like vessels in the brain, where CCM mutant cells recruit wild-type cells from the surrounding endothelium to form mosaic lesions and promote lesion growth; however the mechanisms underlying this recruitment remain poorly understood. Here, we use 3D traction force microscopy in a in-vitro model of early angiogenic invasion to reveal that hyper-angiogenic CCM2-silenced endothelial cells enhance angiogenic invasion of neighboring wild-type cells through force and extracellular matrix-guided mechanisms. We show that mechanically hyperactive CCM2-silenced tips guide wild-type cells by exerting and transmitting pulling forces and by leaving degraded paths in the matrix as cues promoting invasion in a ROCKs-dependent manner. This transmission of forces is associated with a reinforcement of {beta}1 integrin-dependent adhesive sites and actin cytoskeleton in the wild-type followers. We also show that during this process wild-type cells are reprogrammed into stalk cells through activation of matrisome and DNA replication programs, eventually leading to cell proliferation. These observations unveil a novel vascular lesion growth mechanism where CCM2 mutants hijack the function of wild-type cells to fuel CCM lesion growth. By integrating biophysical computational methodologies to quantify cellular forces with advanced molecular techniques, we provide new insights in the etiology of vascular malformations, and open up avenues to study the role of cell mechanics in tissue heterogeneity and disease progression.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Generating mammalian gametes with a skewed sex ratio has thus far eluded empirical confirmation. The utilization of such genetically engineered organisms would offer the potential to curtail the necessity for culling animals of undesirable sex, mitigate resource wastage, and alleviate superfluous labor burdens. In this study, we introduce a transgenic male mouse lineage, which consistently yields predominantly female progeny (comprising up to 91% of the total offspring). This accomplishment was made possible by integrating a controllable genetic cassette onto the Y chromosome. The cassette encodes dCas9 and RNA guides that selectively silence a spermatid maturation gene. After the separation of X and Y gametes during meiosis, gametes containing an X chromosome develop normally, while those harboring the engineered Y chromosome, subjected to dCas9 silencing of the spermatid maturation gene, do not mature properly. Indeed, some spermatozoa from the transgenic mice exhibit a unique morphology, associated with the absence of the maturation gene. Notably, the resultant female offspring do not inherit the genetically engineered Y chromosome and are thus not genetically modified. Importantly, the litter size of the transgenic mice remains unchanged compared to the wild type. These findings represent a groundbreaking demonstration of genetic engineerings potential to yield sex-biased litters of full size without compromising genetic integrity, marking a pioneering advancement in this field of study.

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) allows quantifying proteins with high specificity and sensitivity. To increase its throughput, we developed nPOP, a method for parallel preparation of thousands of single cells in nanoliter volume droplets deposited on glass slides. Here, we describe its protocol with emphasis on its flexibility to prepare samples for different multiplexed MS methods. An implementation with plexDIA demonstrates accurate quantification of about 3,000 - 3,700 proteins per human cell. The protocol is implemented on the CellenONE instrument and uses readily available consumables, which should facilitate broad adoption. nPOP can be applied to all samples that can be processed to a single-cell suspension. It takes 1 or 2 days to prepare over 3,000 single cells. We provide metrics and software for quality control that can support the robust scaling of nPOP to higher plex reagents for achieving reliable high-throughput single-cell protein analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The delivery of CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for genome editing in vitro and in vivo has important advantages over other delivery methods, including reduced off-target and immunogenic effects1. However, effective delivery of RNPs remains challenging in certain cell types due to low efficiency and cell toxicity. To address these issues, we engineered self-deliverable RNPs that can promote efficient cellular uptake and carry out robust genome editing without the need for helper materials or biomolecules. Screening of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) fused to CRISPR-Cas9 protein identified potent constructs capable of efficient genome editing of neural progenitor cells. Further engineering of these fusion proteins identified a C-terminal Cas9 fusion with three copies of A22p, a peptide derived from human semaphorin-3a, that exhibited substantially improved editing efficacy compared to other constructs. We found that self-deliverable Cas9 RNPs generated robust genome edits in clinically relevant genes when injected directly into the mouse striatum. Overall, self-deliverable Cas9 proteins provide a facile and effective platform for genome editing in vitro and in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Older adults have difficulty maintaining balance when faced with postural disturbances, a task that is influenced by the stiffness of the triceps surae and Achilles tendon. Age-related changes in Achilles tendon stiffness have been reported at matched levels of effort, but measures typically have not been made at matched loads, which is important due to age-dependent changes in strength. Moreover, age-dependent changes in muscle stiffness have yet to be tested. Here, we investigate how age alters muscle and tendon stiffness and their influence on ankle stiffness. We hypothesized that age-related changes in muscle and tendon contribute to reduced ankle stiffness in older adults and evaluated this hypothesis when either load or effort were matched. We used B-mode ultrasound with joint-level perturbations to quantify ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness across a range of loads and efforts in seventeen healthy younger and older adults. At matched loads, there was no significant difference in ankle, muscle, or tendon stiffness between groups (all p&gt;0.13). However, at matched effort, older adults exhibited a significant decrease in ankle (27%; p=0.008), muscle (37%; p=0.02), and tendon stiffness (22%; p=0.03) at 30% of maximum effort. This is consistent with our finding that older adults were 36% weaker than younger adults in plantarflexion (p=0.004). Together these results indicate that, at the loads tested in this study, there are no age-dependent changes in the mechanical properties of muscle or tendon, only differences in strength that result in altered ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness at matched levels of effort.

NO_SCPLOWEWC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOW NO_SCPLOWOTEWORTHYC_SCPLOWWe provide the first simultaneous estimates of ankle, muscle, and tendon stiffness in younger and older adults. In contrast to earlier conclusions, we found that muscle and tendon mechanical properties are unaffected by age when compared at matched loads. However, due to age-related decreases in strength, mechanical properties do differ at matched efforts. As such, it is important to assess the relevance of the comparisons being made relative to the functional tasks under consideration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enhancing the efficacy of cytokine-based therapies by systematically tuning how an agonist associates its receptor is emerging as a powerful new concept in drug discovery. De novo protein design can serve an excellent tool for tailoring novel cytokine receptor agonists with altered binding affinities and geometries. Here, we report the design and characterization of agonists that tune the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) activity, which is central for the proliferation and granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Selected design agonists were deployed to study the impact of varying the binding affinity and dimerization geometry on receptor association, downstream signaling, and cellular response. Hence, we achieved design agonists with altered signaling specificities that are hyper-thermostable, engage the receptor with tight affinity, and bias granulopoietic differentiation over triggering proliferation. Furthermore, the design agonists modulate the kinetics and amplitudes of signal transduction pathways, yielding differential gene expression patterns. Thus, unlike G-CSF, the design agonists could achieve selective activation of hematopoietic stem cell functions with minimal undesired immunomodulatory effects. These findings demonstrate the potential of dissecting the complexity of G-CSFR signaling, outcompeting the native ligand, and therefore open ways for more specific therapeutic applications.

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms responsible for increased walking metabolic cost among older adults are poorly understood. We recently proposed a theoretical premise by which age-related reductions in Achilles tendon stiffness (kAT) can disrupt the neuromechanics of calf muscle behavior and contribute to faster rates of oxygen consumption during walking. The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate this premise. We quantified kAT at a range of matched activations prescribed using electromyographic biofeedback and walking metabolic cost in a group of 15 younger (age: 23{&#43;/-}4 yrs) and 15 older adults (age: 72{&#43;/-}5 yrs). Older adults averaged 44% less kAT than younger adults at matched triceps surae activations (p=0.046). This effect appeared to arise not only from altered tendon length-tension relations with age, but also from differences in the operating region of those length-tension relations between younger and older adults. Older adults also walked with a 17% higher net metabolic power than younger adults (p=0.017). In addition, we discovered empirical evidence that lesser kAT exacts a metabolic penalty and was positively correlated with higher net metabolic power during walking (r=-0.365, p=0.048). These results pave the way for interventions focused on restoring ankle muscle-tendon unit structural stiffness to improve walking energetics in aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatial transcriptomics has been widely used to capture gene expression profiles, realised as a two-dimensional (2D) projection of RNA captured from tissue sections. Wree-dimensional (3D) cultures such as spheroids and organoids are highly promising alternatives to oversimplified and homogeneous 2D cell culture models, but existing spatial transcriptomic platforms do not currently have sufficient resolution for robust analysis of 3D cultures. We present a transfection-based method for fluorescent DNA barcoding of cell populations, and the subsequent construction of spheroidal cellular architectures using barcoded cells in a layer-by-layer approach. For the first time, changes in gene expression throughout this 3D culture architecture are interrogated using multiplex single-cell RNA sequencing in which DNA barcodes are used to encode the spatial positioning of cells. We show that transfection with fluorophore-conjugated barcode oligonucleotides enables both imaging and sequencing at single-cell resolution, providing spatial maps of gene expression and drug response. Additionally, we show that fluorophore-conjugated DNA barcodes support correlative imaging studies such as mechano-microscopy to capture information about spatially-varying mechanical heterogeneity in 3D cultures. We ability to create customised, encoded cellular assemblies is a general approach that can resolve spatial differences in gene expression in 3D cell culture models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Micro-physiological systems (MPS) are set to play a vital role in preclinical studies, particularly in the context of future viral pandemics. Nonetheless, the development of MPS is often impeded by the scarcity of reliable cell sources, especially when seeking various organs or tissues from a single patient for comparative analysis of the host immune response. Herein, we developed human airway-on-chip and alveolus-on-chip models using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived isogenic lung progenitor cells. Both models demonstrated the replication of two different respiratory viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza, as well as related cellular damage and innate immune responses-on-chip. Our findings reveal distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the proximal and distal lung-on-chip models. The airway chips exhibited a robust interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, whereas the alveolus chips exhibited dysregulated IFN activation but a significantly upregulated chemokine pathway. In contrast, Influenza virus infection induced a more pronounced immune response and cellular damage in both chip models compared to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, iPSC-derived lung-on-chip models may aid in quickly gaining insights into viral pathology and screening potential drugs for future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Slip and fall incidents are a serious health care concern globally. Previous research describes a backwards loss of balance during a slip incident, however hip fractures only occur if individuals fall on their side. Therefore, this study is investigating and quantifying the trunk motion in the sagittal and frontal plane. 13 healthy young participants trunk kinematics were analyzed during a slip incident. Peak trunk angle of the trunk in the sagittal and frontal plane were calculated. There was no significant difference between sagittal and frontal plane peak trunk angles suggesting that there is frontal plane motion during an overground slip incident. Our findings suggest research should investigate frontal plane mechanics during a slip incident as there is trunk frontal plane motion which if uncontrolled can result in falling on the femoral neck. Understanding and preventing falls based upon frontal plane mechanics may be more useful for preventing hip fractures from a slip incident. Lastly, the findings of this study are confirmatory results as the frontal plane trunk motion was quantified and reported in 2008.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Force-driven cellular interactions are known to play a critical role in cancer cell invasion, but have remained largely unexplored in the context of vascular abnormalities, partly due to a lack of suitable genetic and cellular models. One such vascular abnormality, cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is characterized by leaky, tumor-like vessels in the brain, where CCM mutant cells recruit wild-type cells from the surrounding endothelium to form mosaic lesions and promote lesion growth; however the mechanisms underlying this recruitment remain poorly understood. Here, we use 3D traction force microscopy in a in-vitro model of early angiogenic invasion to reveal that hyper-angiogenic CCM2-silenced endothelial cells enhance angiogenic invasion of neighboring wild-type cells through force and extracellular matrix-guided mechanisms. We show that mechanically hyperactive CCM2-silenced tips guide wild-type cells by exerting and transmitting pulling forces and by leaving degraded paths in the matrix as cues promoting invasion in a ROCKs-dependent manner. This transmission of forces is associated with a reinforcement of {beta}1 integrin-dependent adhesive sites and actin cytoskeleton in the wild-type followers. We also show that during this process wild-type cells are reprogrammed into stalk cells through activation of matrisome and DNA replication programs, eventually leading to cell proliferation. These observations unveil a novel vascular lesion growth mechanism where CCM2 mutants hijack the function of wild-type cells to fuel CCM lesion growth. By integrating biophysical computational methodologies to quantify cellular forces with advanced molecular techniques, we provide new insights in the etiology of vascular malformations, and open up avenues to study the role of cell mechanics in tissue heterogeneity and disease progression.</p>
