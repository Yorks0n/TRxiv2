We show here that the loading of type-1 membrane proteins into the exosome membrane is induced by exosome membrane anchor domains, EMADs, that maximize protein delivery to the plasma membrane, minimize protein sorting to other compartments, and direct proteins into exosome membranes. Using SARS-CoV-2 spike as an example and EMAD13 as our most effective exosome membrane anchor, we show that cells expressing a spike-EMAD13 fusion protein produced exosomes that carry dense arrays of spike trimers on 50% of all exosomes. Moreover, we find that immunization with spike-EMAD13 exosomes induced strong neutralizing antibody responses and protected hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 disease at doses of just 0.5-5 ng of spike protein, without adjuvant, demonstrating that antigen-display exosomes are particularly immunogenic, with important implications for both structural and expression-dependent vaccines.\nSpatial genomics of AAVs reveals mechanism of transcriptional crosstalk that enables targeted delivery of large genetic cargo\nAuthors: Coughlin, G. M.; Borsos, M.; Appling, N.; Barcelona, B. H.; Mayfield, A. M. H.; Mackey, E. D.; Eser, R. A.; Chen, X.; Kumar, S. R.; Gradinaru, V.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573214\nIntegrating cell type-specific regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers) with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) can provide broad and efficient genetic access to specific cell types. However, the packaging capacity of AAVs restricts the size of both the enhancers and the cargo that can be delivered. Transcriptional crosstalk offers a novel paradigm for cell type-specific expression of large cargo, by separating distally-acting regulatory elements into a second AAV genome. Here, we identify and profile transcriptional crosstalk in AAV genomes carrying 11 different enhancers active in mouse brain. To understand transcriptional crosstalk, we develop spatial genomics methods to identify and localize AAV genomes and their concatemeric forms in cultured cells and in tissue. Using these methods, we construct detailed views of the dynamics of AAV transduction and demonstrate that transcriptional crosstalk is dependent upon concatemer formation. Finally, we leverage transcriptional crosstalk to drive expression of a large Cas9 cargo in a cell type-specific manner with systemically-administered engineered AAVs and demonstrate AAV-delivered, minimally-invasive, cell type-specific gene editing in wildtype animals that recapitulates known disease phenotypes. HighlightsO_LITranscriptional crosstalk between enhancers and promoters delivered in trans by AAVs is a generalized phenomenon. C_LIO_LISpatial genomics techniques, AAV-Zombie and SpECTr, reveal that AAV genome concatemerization facilitates transcriptional crosstalk. C_LIO_LITranscriptional crosstalk can be leveraged for minimally-invasive, targeted AAV delivery of large cargo, including machinery for CRISPR-based gene editing and manipulation. C_LIO_LITranscriptional crosstalk enables cell-type specific gene disruption in wildtype animals, recapitulating behavioural phenotypes of genetic knockouts.

M.; Pfeifer, W.; Shokri, S.; Wei, Y.; Didier, P.; DeLuca, M.; Arya, G.; Tora, L.; Lakadamyali, M.; Poirier, M. G.; Castro, C.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573746\nDNA origami (DO) are promising tools for in vitro or in vivo applications including drug delivery; biosensing, detecting biomolecules; and probing chromatin sub-structures. Targeting these nanodevices to mammalian cell nuclei could provide impactful approaches for probing visualizing and controlling important biological processes in live cells. Here we present an approach to deliver DO strucures into live cell nuclei. We show that labelled DOs do not undergo detectable structural degradation in cell culture media or human cell extracts for 24 hr. To deliver DO platforms into the nuclei of human U2OS cells, we conjugated 30 nm long DO nanorods with an antibody raised against the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), a key enzyme involved in gene transcription. We find that DOs remain structurally intact in cells for 24hr, including within the nucleus. Using fluorescence microscopy we demonstrate that the electroporated anti-Pol II antibody conjugated DOs are efficiently piggybacked into nuclei and exihibit sub-diffusive motion inside the nucleus. Our results reveal that functionalizing DOs with an antibody raised against a nuclear factor is a highly effective method for the delivery of nanodevices into live cell nuclei.\nDevelopment of a robotic cluster for automated and scalable cell therapy manufacturing\nAuthors: Melocchi, A.; Schmittlein, B.; Jones, A.

H.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572854\nThe production of commercial autologous cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells requires complex manual manufacturing processes. Skilled labor costs and challenges in manufacturing scale-out have contributed to high prices for these products. Here, we present a robotic system that uses industry-standard cell therapy manufacturing equipment to automate the steps involved in cell therapy manufacturing. The robotic cluster consists of a robotic arm and customized modules, allowing the robot to manipulate a variety of standard cell therapy instruments and materials such as incubators, bioreactors, and reagent bags. This system enables existing manual manufacturing processes to be rapidly adapted to robotic manufacturing, without having to adopt a completely new technology platform. Proof-of-concept for the robotic clusters expansion module was demonstrated by activating and expanding human CD8+ T cells. The robotic cultures showed comparable cell yields, viability, and identity to those manually performed. Such modular robotic solutions may support scale-up and scale-out of cell therapies that are developed using classical manual methods in academic laboratories and biotechnology companies.\nContrast-enhanced photon-counting micro-CT of tumor xenograft models\nAuthors: Li, M.; Guo, X.; Verma, A.; Rudkouskaya, A.; McKenna, A.; Intes, X. R. M.; Wang, G.; Barroso, M.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574097\nPhoton-counting micro computed tomography (micro-CT) offers new potential in preclinical imaging, particularly in distinguishing materials. It becomes especially helpful when combined with contrast agents, enabling the differentiation of tumors from surrounding tissues. There are mainly two types of contrast agents in the market for micro-CT: small molecule-based and nanoparticle-based. However, despite their widespread use in liver tumor studies, there is a notable gap in research on the application of these commercially available agents for photon-counting micro-CT in breast and ovarian tumors. Herein, we explored the effectiveness of these agents in differentiating tumor xenografts from various origins (AU565, MDA-MB-231, and SKOV-3) in nude mice, using photon-counting micro-CT. Specifically, ISOVUE-370 (a small molecule-based agent) and Exitrone Nano 12000 (a nanoparticle-based agent) were investigated in this context. To improve tumor visualization, we proposed a novel color visualization method for photon-counting micro-CT, which changes color tones to highlight contrast media distribution, offering a robust alternative to traditional material decomposition methods with less computational demand. Our in vivo experiments confirm its effectiveness, showing distinct enhancement characteristics for each contrast agent. Qualitative and quantitative analyses suggested that Exitrone Nano 12000 provides superior vasculature enhancement and better quantitative consistency across scans, while ISOVUE-370 gives more comprehensive tumor enhancement but with a significant variance between scans due to its short blood half-time. This variability leads to high sensitivity to timing and individual differences among mice. Further, a paired t-test on mean and standard deviation values within tumor volumes showed significant differences between the AU565 and SKOV-3 tumor models with the nanoparticle-based (p-values \u003c 0.02), attributable to their distinct vascularity, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These findings underscore the utility of photon-counting micro-CT in non-invasively assessing the morphology and anatomy of different tumor xenografts, which is crucial for tumor characterization and longitudinal monitoring of tumor development and response to treatments.\nDemonstration of chemotherapeutic mediated lymphatic changes in meningeal lymphatics in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo\nAuthors: Roberts, L. M.; Hammel, J. H.; Azar, F.; Feng, T.-Y.; Cunningham, J. J.; Rutkowski, M. R.; Munson, J.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.574460\nSystemic chemotherapeutics target cancer cells but are also known to impact other cells away from the tumor. Questions remain whether systemic chemotherapy crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes inflammation in the periphery that impacts the central nervous system (CNS) downstream. The meningeal lymphatics are a critical component that drain cerebrospinal fluid from the CNS to the cervical lymph nodes for immunosurveillence. To develop new tools for understanding chemotherapy-mediated effects on the meningeal lymphatics, we present two novel models that examine cellular and tissue level changes. Our in vitro tissue engineered model of a meningeal lymphatic vessel lumen, using a simple tissue culture insert system with both lymphatic endothelial and meningeal cells, examines cell disruption. Our ex vivo model culturing mouse meningeal layers probes structural changes and remodeling, correlating to an explant tissue level. To gain a holistic understanding, we compare our in vitro and ex vivo models to in vivo studies for validation and a three-tier methodology for examining the chemotherapeutic response of the meningeal lymphatics. We have demonstrated that the meningeal lymphatics can be disrupted by systemic chemotherapy but show differential responses to platinum and taxane chemotherapies, emphasizing the need for further study of off-target impacts in the CNS.\nHigh-resolution low-cost LCD 3D printing of microfluidics\nAuthors: Shafique, H.; Karamzadeh, V.; Kim, G.; Morocz, Y.; Sohrabi-Kashani, A.; Shen, M. L.; Juncker, D.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573772\nThe fabrication of microfluidic devices has progressed from cleanroom manufacturing to replica molding in polymers, and more recently to direct manufacturing by subtractive (e.g., laser machining) and additive (e.g., 3D printing) techniques, notably digital light processing (DLP) photopolymerization. However, many methods require technical expertise and while DLP 3D printers remain expensive at a cost [~]15-30K USD with [~]8M pixels that are 25-40 {micro}m in size. Here, we introduce (i) the use of low-cost ([~]150-600 USD) liquid crystal display (LCD) photopolymerization 3D printing with [~]8M-58M pixels that are 18-35 {micro}m in size for direct microfluidic device fabrication and (ii) a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-based ink developed for LCD 3D printing (PLInk). We optimized PLInk for high resolution, fast 3D printing and biocompatibility while considering the illumination inhomogeneity and low power density of LCD 3D printers. We made lateral features as small as 75 {micro}m, 22-{micro}m-thick embedded membranes, and circular channels with a 110 {micro}m radius. We 3D printed microfluidic devices previously manufactured by other methods, including an embedded 3D micromixer, a membrane microvalve, and an autonomous capillaric circuit (CC) deployed for interferon-{gamma} detection with excellent performance (limit of detection: 12 pg mL-1, CV: 6.8%), and we demonstrated compatibility with cell culture. Finally, large area manufacturing was illustrated by printing 42 CCs with embedded microchannels in \u003c45 min. LCD 3D printing together with tailored inks pave the way for democratizing access to high-resolution manufacturing of ready-to-use microfluidic devices by anyone, anywhere.\nReinforcement Learning for Control of Human Locomotion in Simulation\nAuthors: Dashkovets, A.; Laschowski, B.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572447\nControl of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons is an open challenge. Computer modeling and simulation can be used to study the dynamics and control of human walking and extract principles that can be programmed into robotic legs to behave similar to biological legs. In this study, we present the development of an efficient two-layer Q-learning algorithm, with k-d trees, that operates over continuous action spaces and a reward model that estimates the degree of muscle activation similarity between the agent and human state-to-action pairs and state-to-action sequences. We used a human musculoskeletal model acting in a high-dimensional, physics-based simulation environment to train and evaluate our algorithm to simulate biomimetic walking. We used imitation learning and artificial bio-mechanics data to accelerate training via expert demonstrations and used experimental human data to compare and validate our predictive simulations, achieving 79% accuracy. Also, when compared to the previous state-of-the-art that used deep deterministic policy gradient, our algorithm was significantly more efficient with lower computational and memory storage requirements (i.e., requiring 7 times less RAM and 87 times less CPU compute), which can benefit real-time embedded computing. Overall, our new two-layer Q-learning algorithm using sequential data for continuous imitation of human locomotion serves as a first step towards the development of bioinspired controllers for robotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons. Future work will focus on improving the prediction accuracy compared to experimental data and expanding our simulations to other locomotor activities.\nUltrasound-Driven Programmable Artificial Muscles\nAuthors: Shi, Z.; Zhang, Z.; Ahmed, D.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574699\nDespite their promise for technological and medical innovations, the advancement of artificial muscles faces challenges in dynamic programmability, wireless control, scalability, and responsiveness. Ultrasound offers a promising yet underutilized solution, providing effective and robust actuation. We introduce an innovative design paradigm for soft artificial muscles, utilizing tens of thousands of resonant microbubbles for targeted activation, enabling a wide range of programmable motions. We developed a comprehensive theoretical model and conducted various applications: from actuating soft grippers and powering centimeter-scale biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion to demonstrating the multimodal shape transformation of a functional surface and equipping static objects with transformative robotic skins for mobility. Our approach is marked by its compactness, high force intensity, rapid responsiveness, and lightweightness. The customizable, scalable design of our artificial muscles offers both immediate and long-term impact on robotics, wearable technology, haptics, prosthetic development, and the development of avant-garde biomedical devices like soft surgical tools.\nHuman cell surface-AAV interactomes identify LRP6 as blood-brain-barrier transcytosis receptor and immune cytokine IL3 as AAV9 binder\nAuthors: Shay, T.

R.; Chou, T.-F.; Gradinaru, V.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574399\nAdeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are foundational gene delivery tools for basic science and clinical therapeutics. However, lack of mechanistic insight, especially for engineered vectors created by directed evolution, can hamper their application. Here, we adapted an unbiased human cell microarray platform to determine the extracellular and cell surface interactomes of natural and engineered AAVs. We identified a naturally-evolved and serotype-specific interaction between the AAV9 capsid and human interleukin 3 (IL3), with possible roles in host immune modulation, as well as lab-evolved low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein 6 (LRP6) interactions specific to engineered capsids that cross the blood-brain barrier in non-human primates after intravenous administration. The unbiased cell microarray screening approach also allowed us to identify off-target tissue binding interactions of engineered brain-enriched AAV capsids that may inform vectors peripheral organ tropism and side effects. These results allow confident application of engineered AAVs in diverse organisms and unlock future target-informed engineering of improved viral and non-viral vectors for non-invasive therapeutic delivery to the brain.\n",

        <p class="abstract">As the only bionormal nanovesicle, exosomes have high potential as a nanovesicle for delivering vaccines and therapeutics. We show here that the loading of type-1 membrane proteins into the exosome membrane is induced by exosome membrane anchor domains, EMADs, that maximize protein delivery to the plasma membrane, minimize protein sorting to other compartments, and direct proteins into exosome membranes. Using SARS-CoV-2 spike as an example and EMAD13 as our most effective exosome membrane anchor, we show that cells expressing a spike-EMAD13 fusion protein produced exosomes that carry dense arrays of spike trimers on 50% of all exosomes. Moreover, we find that immunization with spike-EMAD13 exosomes induced strong neutralizing antibody responses and protected hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 disease at doses of just 0.5-5 ng of spike protein, without adjuvant, demonstrating that antigen-display exosomes are particularly immunogenic, with important implications for both structural and expression-dependent vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Integrating cell type-specific regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers) with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) can provide broad and efficient genetic access to specific cell types. However, the packaging capacity of AAVs restricts the size of both the enhancers and the cargo that can be delivered. Transcriptional crosstalk offers a novel paradigm for cell type-specific expression of large cargo, by separating distally-acting regulatory elements into a second AAV genome. Here, we identify and profile transcriptional crosstalk in AAV genomes carrying 11 different enhancers active in mouse brain. To understand transcriptional crosstalk, we develop spatial genomics methods to identify and localize AAV genomes and their concatemeric forms in cultured cells and in tissue. Using these methods, we construct detailed views of the dynamics of AAV transduction and demonstrate that transcriptional crosstalk is dependent upon concatemer formation. Finally, we leverage transcriptional crosstalk to drive expression of a large Cas9 cargo in a cell type-specific manner with systemically-administered engineered AAVs and demonstrate AAV-delivered, minimally-invasive, cell type-specific gene editing in wildtype animals that recapitulates known disease phenotypes.

HighlightsO_LITranscriptional crosstalk between enhancers and promoters delivered in trans by AAVs is a generalized phenomenon.
C_LIO_LISpatial genomics techniques, AAV-Zombie and SpECTr, reveal that AAV genome concatemerization facilitates transcriptional crosstalk.
C_LIO_LITranscriptional crosstalk can be leveraged for minimally-invasive, targeted AAV delivery of large cargo, including machinery for CRISPR-based gene editing and manipulation.
C_LIO_LITranscriptional crosstalk enables cell-type specific gene disruption in wildtype animals, recapitulating behavioural phenotypes of genetic knockouts.

        <p class="abstract">DNA origami (DO) are promising tools for in vitro or in vivo applications including drug delivery; biosensing, detecting biomolecules; and probing chromatin sub-structures. Targeting these nanodevices to mammalian cell nuclei could provide impactful approaches for probing visualizing and controlling important biological processes in live cells. Here we present an approach to deliver DO strucures into live cell nuclei. We show that labelled DOs do not undergo detectable structural degradation in cell culture media or human cell extracts for 24 hr. To deliver DO platforms into the nuclei of human U2OS cells, we conjugated 30 nm long DO nanorods with an antibody raised against the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), a key enzyme involved in gene transcription. We find that DOs remain structurally intact in cells for 24hr, including within the nucleus. Using fluorescence microscopy we demonstrate that the electroporated anti-Pol II antibody conjugated DOs are efficiently piggybacked into nuclei and exihibit sub-diffusive motion inside the nucleus. Our results reveal that functionalizing DOs with an antibody raised against a nuclear factor is a highly effective method for the delivery of nanodevices into live cell nuclei.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The production of commercial autologous cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells requires complex manual manufacturing processes. Skilled labor costs and challenges in manufacturing scale-out have contributed to high prices for these products. Here, we present a robotic system that uses industry-standard cell therapy manufacturing equipment to automate the steps involved in cell therapy manufacturing. The robotic cluster consists of a robotic arm and customized modules, allowing the robot to manipulate a variety of standard cell therapy instruments and materials such as incubators, bioreactors, and reagent bags. This system enables existing manual manufacturing processes to be rapidly adapted to robotic manufacturing, without having to adopt a completely new technology platform. Proof-of-concept for the robotic clusters expansion module was demonstrated by activating and expanding human CD8&#43; T cells. The robotic cultures showed comparable cell yields, viability, and identity to those manually performed. Such modular robotic solutions may support scale-up and scale-out of cell therapies that are developed using classical manual methods in academic laboratories and biotechnology companies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Photon-counting micro computed tomography (micro-CT) offers new potential in preclinical imaging, particularly in distinguishing materials. It becomes especially helpful when combined with contrast agents, enabling the differentiation of tumors from surrounding tissues. There are mainly two types of contrast agents in the market for micro-CT: small molecule-based and nanoparticle-based. However, despite their widespread use in liver tumor studies, there is a notable gap in research on the application of these commercially available agents for photon-counting micro-CT in breast and ovarian tumors. Herein, we explored the effectiveness of these agents in differentiating tumor xenografts from various origins (AU565, MDA-MB-231, and SKOV-3) in nude mice, using photon-counting micro-CT. Specifically, ISOVUE-370 (a small molecule-based agent) and Exitrone Nano 12000 (a nanoparticle-based agent) were investigated in this context. To improve tumor visualization, we proposed a novel color visualization method for photon-counting micro-CT, which changes color tones to highlight contrast media distribution, offering a robust alternative to traditional material decomposition methods with less computational demand. Our in vivo experiments confirm its effectiveness, showing distinct enhancement characteristics for each contrast agent. Qualitative and quantitative analyses suggested that Exitrone Nano 12000 provides superior vasculature enhancement and better quantitative consistency across scans, while ISOVUE-370 gives more comprehensive tumor enhancement but with a significant variance between scans due to its short blood half-time. This variability leads to high sensitivity to timing and individual differences among mice. Further, a paired t-test on mean and standard deviation values within tumor volumes showed significant differences between the AU565 and SKOV-3 tumor models with the nanoparticle-based (p-values &lt; 0.02), attributable to their distinct vascularity, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These findings underscore the utility of photon-counting micro-CT in non-invasively assessing the morphology and anatomy of different tumor xenografts, which is crucial for tumor characterization and longitudinal monitoring of tumor development and response to treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Systemic chemotherapeutics target cancer cells but are also known to impact other cells away from the tumor. Questions remain whether systemic chemotherapy crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes inflammation in the periphery that impacts the central nervous system (CNS) downstream. The meningeal lymphatics are a critical component that drain cerebrospinal fluid from the CNS to the cervical lymph nodes for immunosurveillence. To develop new tools for understanding chemotherapy-mediated effects on the meningeal lymphatics, we present two novel models that examine cellular and tissue level changes. Our in vitro tissue engineered model of a meningeal lymphatic vessel lumen, using a simple tissue culture insert system with both lymphatic endothelial and meningeal cells, examines cell disruption. Our ex vivo model culturing mouse meningeal layers probes structural changes and remodeling, correlating to an explant tissue level. To gain a holistic understanding, we compare our in vitro and ex vivo models to in vivo studies for validation and a three-tier methodology for examining the chemotherapeutic response of the meningeal lymphatics. We have demonstrated that the meningeal lymphatics can be disrupted by systemic chemotherapy but show differential responses to platinum and taxane chemotherapies, emphasizing the need for further study of off-target impacts in the CNS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fabrication of microfluidic devices has progressed from cleanroom manufacturing to replica molding in polymers, and more recently to direct manufacturing by subtractive (e.g., laser machining) and additive (e.g., 3D printing) techniques, notably digital light processing (DLP) photopolymerization. However, many methods require technical expertise and while DLP 3D printers remain expensive at a cost [~]15-30K USD with [~]8M pixels that are 25-40 {micro}m in size. Here, we introduce (i) the use of low-cost ([~]150-600 USD) liquid crystal display (LCD) photopolymerization 3D printing with [~]8M-58M pixels that are 18-35 {micro}m in size for direct microfluidic device fabrication and (ii) a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-based ink developed for LCD 3D printing (PLInk). We optimized PLInk for high resolution, fast 3D printing and biocompatibility while considering the illumination inhomogeneity and low power density of LCD 3D printers. We made lateral features as small as 75 {micro}m, 22-{micro}m-thick embedded membranes, and circular channels with a 110 {micro}m radius. We 3D printed microfluidic devices previously manufactured by other methods, including an embedded 3D micromixer, a membrane microvalve, and an autonomous capillaric circuit (CC) deployed for interferon-{gamma} detection with excellent performance (limit of detection: 12 pg mL-1, CV: 6.8%), and we demonstrated compatibility with cell culture. Finally, large area manufacturing was illustrated by printing 42 CCs with embedded microchannels in &lt;45 min. LCD 3D printing together with tailored inks pave the way for democratizing access to high-resolution manufacturing of ready-to-use microfluidic devices by anyone, anywhere.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Control of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons is an open challenge. Computer modeling and simulation can be used to study the dynamics and control of human walking and extract principles that can be programmed into robotic legs to behave similar to biological legs. In this study, we present the development of an efficient two-layer Q-learning algorithm, with k-d trees, that operates over continuous action spaces and a reward model that estimates the degree of muscle activation similarity between the agent and human state-to-action pairs and state-to-action sequences. We used a human musculoskeletal model acting in a high-dimensional, physics-based simulation environment to train and evaluate our algorithm to simulate biomimetic walking. We used imitation learning and artificial bio-mechanics data to accelerate training via expert demonstrations and used experimental human data to compare and validate our predictive simulations, achieving 79% accuracy. Also, when compared to the previous state-of-the-art that used deep deterministic policy gradient, our algorithm was significantly more efficient with lower computational and memory storage requirements (i.e., requiring 7 times less RAM and 87 times less CPU compute), which can benefit real-time embedded computing. Overall, our new two-layer Q-learning algorithm using sequential data for continuous imitation of human locomotion serves as a first step towards the development of bioinspired controllers for robotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons. Future work will focus on improving the prediction accuracy compared to experimental data and expanding our simulations to other locomotor activities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite their promise for technological and medical innovations, the advancement of artificial muscles faces challenges in dynamic programmability, wireless control, scalability, and responsiveness. Ultrasound offers a promising yet underutilized solution, providing effective and robust actuation. We introduce an innovative design paradigm for soft artificial muscles, utilizing tens of thousands of resonant microbubbles for targeted activation, enabling a wide range of programmable motions. We developed a comprehensive theoretical model and conducted various applications: from actuating soft grippers and powering centimeter-scale biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion to demonstrating the multimodal shape transformation of a functional surface and equipping static objects with transformative robotic skins for mobility. Our approach is marked by its compactness, high force intensity, rapid responsiveness, and lightweightness. The customizable, scalable design of our artificial muscles offers both immediate and long-term impact on robotics, wearable technology, haptics, prosthetic development, and the development of avant-garde biomedical devices like soft surgical tools.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are foundational gene delivery tools for basic science and clinical therapeutics. However, lack of mechanistic insight, especially for engineered vectors created by directed evolution, can hamper their application. Here, we adapted an unbiased human cell microarray platform to determine the extracellular and cell surface interactomes of natural and engineered AAVs. We identified a naturally-evolved and serotype-specific interaction between the AAV9 capsid and human interleukin 3 (IL3), with possible roles in host immune modulation, as well as lab-evolved low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein 6 (LRP6) interactions specific to engineered capsids that cross the blood-brain barrier in non-human primates after intravenous administration. The unbiased cell microarray screening approach also allowed us to identify off-target tissue binding interactions of engineered brain-enriched AAV capsids that may inform vectors peripheral organ tropism and side effects. These results allow confident application of engineered AAVs in diverse organisms and unlock future target-informed engineering of improved viral and non-viral vectors for non-invasive therapeutic delivery to the brain.</p>
