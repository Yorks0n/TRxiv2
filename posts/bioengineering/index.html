L.\nScore: 29.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577267\nRetrons are bacterial immune systems that use reverse transcribed DNA as a detector of phage infection. They are also increasingly deployed as a component of biotechnology. For genome editing, for instance, retrons are modified so that the reverse transcribed DNA (RT-DNA) encodes an editing donor. Retrons are commonly found in bacterial genomes; thousands of unique retrons have now been predicted bioinformatically. However, only a small number have been characterized experimentally. Here, we add substantially to the corpus of experimentally studied retrons. We synthesized \u003e100 previously untested retrons to identify the natural sequence of RT-DNA they produce, quantify their RT-DNA production, and test the relative efficacy of editing using retron-derived donors to edit bacterial genomes, phage genomes, and human genomes. We add 62 new empirically determined, natural RT-DNAs, which are not predictable from the retron sequence alone. We report a large diversity in RT-DNA production and editing rates across retrons, finding that top performing editors outperform those used in previous studies, and are drawn from a subset of the retron phylogeny.\nTreatment of a genetic liver disease in mice through transient prime editor expression\nAuthors: Rothgangl, T.; Ioannidi, E. I.; Weber, Y.; Talas, A.; Boeck, D.; Matsushita, M.; Villiger, E. A.; Schmidheini, L.; Moon, J.; Lin, P. J. C.; Fan, S. H. Y.; Marquart, K. F.; Schwerdel, C.; Rimann, N.; Faccin, E.; Cremonesi, A.; Villiger, L.; Muramatsu, H.; Vadovics, M.; Thoeny, B.; Kopf, M.; Haeberle, J.; Pardi, N.; Tam, Y. K.; Schwank, G.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.575834\nPrime editing is a versatile genome editing technology that does not rely on DNA double-strand break formation and homology-directed repair (HDR). This makes it a promising tool for correcting pathogenic mutations in tissues consisting predominantly of postmitotic cells, such as the liver. While recent studies have already demonstrated proof-of-concept for in vivo prime editing, the use of viral delivery vectors resulted in prolonged prime editor (PE) expression, posing challenges for clinical application. Here, we developed an in vivo prime editing approach where we delivered the pegRNA using self-complementary adeno-associated viral (scAAV) vectors and the prime editor using nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This methodology led to transient expression of the PE for 48h and 26% editing at the Dnmt1 locus using AAV doses of 2.5x1013 vector genomes (vg)/kg and a single dose of 3mg/kg mRNA-LNP. When targeting the pathogenic mutation in the Pahenu2 mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU), we achieved 4.3% gene correction using an AAV dose of 2.5x1013 vg/kg and three doses of 2 mg/kg mRNA-LNP. Editing was specific to the liver and the intended locus, and was sufficient to reduce blood L-phenylalanine (Phe) levels from over 1500 {micro}mol/l to below the therapeutic threshold of 600 {micro}mol/l. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo gene correction in the liver with transient PE expression, bringing prime editing closer to clinical application.\nQuantification of local matrix deposition during muscle stem cell activation using engineered hydrogels\nAuthors: Duran, P.; Yang, B. A.; Plaster, E.; Eiken, M.; Loebel, C.; Aguilar, C. A.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576326\nAdult stem cells occupy a niche that contributes to their function, but how stem cells remodel their microenvironment remains an open-ended question. Herein, biomaterials-based systems and metabolic labeling were utilized to evaluate how skeletal muscle stem cells deposit extracellular matrix. Muscle stem cells and committed myoblasts were observed to generate less nascent matrix than muscle resident fibro-adipogenic progenitors. When cultured on substrates that matched the stiffness of physiological uninjured and injured muscles, the increased nascent matrix deposition was associated with stem cell activation. Reducing the ability to deposit nascent matrix in muscle stem cells attenuated function and mimicked impairments observed from muscle stem cells isolated from old aged muscles, which could be rescued with therapeutic supplementation of insulin-like growth factors. These results highlight how nascent matrix production is critical for maintaining healthy stem cell function.\nAutomated Synthesis of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes\nAuthors: Islas, P.; Platnich, C.; Gidi, Y.; Karimi, R.; Ginot, L.; Cosa, G.; Sleiman, H.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576297\nDNA nanotechnology has revolutionized our ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA-based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, we report a fully automated method to produce sequence- and size-defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX-tile-based DNA nanotubes (and flexible wireframe DNA structures) are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single-molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self-assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self-assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (tthrough an ad-hoc developed K-means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single-molecule assembly-analysis-optimization sequence can be used to generate complex, non-covalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.\nRefining Spatial Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry: An Efficient Workflow Tailored for Archival Tissue\nAuthors: Daucke, R.; Rift, C. V.; Bager, N. S.; Saxena, K.; Koffeldt, P. R.; Woessmann, J.; Petrosius, V.; Rugiu, E. S.; Kristensen, B. W.; Klausen, P.; Schoof, E. M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577263\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, while excellent for preserving tissue for extended periods of time, poses a challenge when extracting molecular information. We therefore developed an easily adaptable and highly efficient workflow for extracting high levels of proteins from low-input material. We compared sensitivity between two stains, EpCAM and H\u0026E, across material inputs of ~2 and 1,600 cells. In the context of EpCAM-stained tissue, our investigations unveiled a range from ~1,200 unique protein groups at the lowest input to ~5,900 at the highest. For H\u0026E, the spectrum covers ~900 to ~5,200 protein groups. We found an optimal balance between maximizing detected proteins and minimizing input material to be within the range of ~100 to ~200 cells. With this knowledge, we tested the spatial capabilities by isolating specific cell populations, through Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), from three different tissue types, where we were able to identify tissue-specific signatures and prominent clustering of all cell populations.\nSurface Patterned Omniphobic Tiles (SPOTs): a versatile platform for scalable liquid handling\nAuthors: Shiri, S.; Qazi, M. J.; Tan, S.; Albo, J.; Chen, A.; Fukuda, R.; Jain, M. S.; Menesses, M.; Nchinda, N.; Ahmed, G.; Gallegos, A.; Gangishetty, M.; Congreve, D.; Cira, N. J.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575712\nManipulating liquids is a ubiquitous need for experiments across numerous scientific disciplines. To overcome limitations of current methods, we introduce Surface Patterned Omniphobic Tiles (SPOTs). This platform combines geometry and surface engineering, building on discontinuous wetting approaches to leverage capillarity for metering liquids. The SPOTs platform allows manipulation of hundreds to thousands of independent experiments without expensive equipment or large consumable costs. These devices can handle a wide range of liquid types and volumes (\u003c10 nanoliters to \u003e10 microliters) with better precision than pipetting. The platform is inexpensive and easy to fabricate, fast and intuitive to use, and cross-compatible with existing microwell plate layouts. We demonstrate how these capabilities facilitate diverse experiments including testing antibiotic combinations for synergy and antagonism, material screening of perovskites, and genotyping microbial isolates. We anticipate SPOTs will enable users from disparate domains to quickly and easily run a wide range of high-throughput experiments.\nHuman vascular organoids with a mosaic AKT1 mutation recapitulate Proteus syndrome\nAuthors: He, S.; Zhu, Y.; Chauhan, S.; Tavakol, D. N.; Lee, J. H.; Berris, R. B.-L.; Xu, C.; Lee, J.; Lee, C.; Cai, S.; McElroy, S.; Vunjak-Novakovic, G.; Tomer, R.; Azizi, E.; Xu, B.; Lao, Y.-H.; Leong, K. W.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577324\nVascular malformation, a key clinical phenotype of Proteus syndrome, lacks effective models for pathophysiological study and drug development due to limited patient sample access. To bridge this gap, we built a human vascular organoid model replicating Proteus syndromes vasculature. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gene overexpression, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embodying the Proteus syndrome-specific AKTE17K point mutation for organoid generation. Our findings revealed that AKT overactivation in these organoids resulted in smaller sizes yet increased vascular connectivity, although with less stable connections. This could be due to the significant vasculogenesis induced by AKT overactivation. This phenomenon likely stems from boosted vasculogenesis triggered by AKT overactivation, leading to increased vascular sprouting. Additionally, a notable increase in dysfunctional PDGFR{beta} + mural cells, impaired in matrix secretion, was observed in these AKT-overactivated organoids. The application of AKT inhibitors (ARQ092, AZD5363, or GDC0068) reversed the vascular malformations; the inhibitors effectiveness was directly linked to reduced connectivity in the organoids. In summary, our study introduces an innovative in vitro model combining organoid technology and gene editing to explore vascular pathophysiology in Proteus syndrome. This model not only simulates Proteus syndrome vasculature but also holds potential for mimicking vasculatures of other genetically driven diseases. It represents an advance in drug development for rare diseases, historically plagued by slow progress.\nSuspension Electrospinning of Decellularized Extracellular Matrix\nAuthors: Jones, S.; VandenHeuval, S.; Luengo Martinez, A.; Burgeson, E.; Raghavan, S.; Rogers, S.; Cosgriff-Hernandez, E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577473\nDecellularized extracellular matrices (dECM) have strong regenerative potential as tissue engineering scaffolds; however, current clinical options for dECM are limited to freeze-drying its native form into sheets. Electrospinning is a versatile scaffold fabrication technique that allows control of macro- and microarchitecture. It remains challenging to electrospin dECM; which has led researchers to either blend it with synthetic materials or use enzymatic digestion to fully solubilize the dECM. Both strategies reduce the innate bioactivity of dECM and limit its regenerative potential. Herein, we developed a new suspension electrospinning method to fabricate a pure dECM scaffold that retains its innate bioactivity. Systematic investigation of suspension parameters was used to identify critical rheological properties required to instill spinnability, including homogenization, concentration, and particle size. Homogenization enhanced particle interaction to impart the requisite elastic behavior to withstand electrostatic drawing without breaking. A direct correlation between concentration and viscosity was observed that altered fiber morphology; whereas, particle size had minimal impact on suspension properties and fiber morphology. The versatility of this new method was demonstrated by electrospinning dECM with three common decellularization techniques (Abraham, Badylak, Luo) and tissue origins (intestinal submucosa, heart, skin). Bioactivity retention after electrospinning was confirmed using cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and macrophage assays. Collectively, these findings provide a framework for researchers to electrospin dECM for diverse tissue engineering applications.\nComputation-aided Design of Rod-Shaped Janus Base Nanopieces for Improved Tissue Penetration and Therapeutics Delivery\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Zhang, W.; Nguyen, D.; Zhou, L.; Amengual, J.; Zhai, J.; Cote, T.; Landolina, M.; Ahmadi, E.; Mishra, N.; Yu, H.; Nieh, M.-P.; Wang, K.; Li, Y.; Chen, Y.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577046\nDespite the development of various drug delivery technologies, there remains a significant need for vehicles that can improve targeting and biodistribution in \"hard-to-penetrate\" tissues. Some solid tumors, for example, are particularly challenging to penetrate due to their dense extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we have formulated a new family of rod-shaped delivery vehicles named Janus base nanopieces (Rod JBNps), which are more slender than conventional spherical nanoparticles, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). These JBNp nanorods are formed by bundles of DNA-inspired Janus base nanotubes (JBNts) with intercalated delivery cargoes. To develop this novel family of delivery vehicles, we employed a computation-aided design (CAD) methodology that includes molecular dynamics and response surface methodology. This approach precisely and efficiently guides experimental designs. Using an ovarian cancer model, we demonstrated that JBNps markedly improve penetration into the dense ECM of solid tumors, leading to better treatment outcomes compared to FDA-approved spherical LNP delivery. This study not only successfully developed a rod-shaped delivery vehicle for improved tissue penetration but also established a CAD methodology to effectively guide material design.\nMicrofluidic platform enables shear-less aerosolization of lipid nanoparticles for messenger RNA inhalation\nAuthors: Kim, J.; Jozic', A.; Bloom, E.; Jones, B.; Marra, M.; Murthy, N. T. V.; Eygeris, Y.; Sahay, G.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576136\nLeveraging the extensive surface area of the lungs for gene therapy, inhalation route offers distinct advantages for delivery. Clinical nebulizers that employ vibrating mesh technology are the standard choice for converting liquid medicines into aerosols. However, they have limitations when it comes to delivering mRNA through inhalation, including severe damage to nanoparticles due to shearing forces. Here, we introduce a novel microfluidic aerosolization platform (MAP) that preserves the structural and physicochemical integrity of lipid nanoparticles, enabling safe and efficient mRNA delivery to the respiratory system. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the novel MAP over the conventional vibrating mesh nebulizer, as it avoided problems such as particle aggregation, loss of mRNA encapsulation, and deformation of nanoparticle morphology. Notably, aerosolized nanoparticles generated by the microfluidic device led to enhanced transfection efficiency across various cell lines. In vivo experiments with mice that inhaled these aerosolized nanoparticles revealed successful, lung-specific mRNA transfection without observable signs of toxicity. This pioneering MAP represents a significant advancement for the pulmonary gene therapy, enabling precise and effective delivery of aerosolized nanoparticles.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Retrons are bacterial immune systems that use reverse transcribed DNA as a detector of phage infection. They are also increasingly deployed as a component of biotechnology. For genome editing, for instance, retrons are modified so that the reverse transcribed DNA (RT-DNA) encodes an editing donor. Retrons are commonly found in bacterial genomes; thousands of unique retrons have now been predicted bioinformatically. However, only a small number have been characterized experimentally. Here, we add substantially to the corpus of experimentally studied retrons. We synthesized &gt;100 previously untested retrons to identify the natural sequence of RT-DNA they produce, quantify their RT-DNA production, and test the relative efficacy of editing using retron-derived donors to edit bacterial genomes, phage genomes, and human genomes. We add 62 new empirically determined, natural RT-DNAs, which are not predictable from the retron sequence alone. We report a large diversity in RT-DNA production and editing rates across retrons, finding that top performing editors outperform those used in previous studies, and are drawn from a subset of the retron phylogeny.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prime editing is a versatile genome editing technology that does not rely on DNA double-strand break formation and homology-directed repair (HDR). This makes it a promising tool for correcting pathogenic mutations in tissues consisting predominantly of postmitotic cells, such as the liver. While recent studies have already demonstrated proof-of-concept for in vivo prime editing, the use of viral delivery vectors resulted in prolonged prime editor (PE) expression, posing challenges for clinical application. Here, we developed an in vivo prime editing approach where we delivered the pegRNA using self-complementary adeno-associated viral (scAAV) vectors and the prime editor using nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This methodology led to transient expression of the PE for 48h and 26% editing at the Dnmt1 locus using AAV doses of 2.5x1013 vector genomes (vg)/kg and a single dose of 3mg/kg mRNA-LNP. When targeting the pathogenic mutation in the Pahenu2 mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU), we achieved 4.3% gene correction using an AAV dose of 2.5x1013 vg/kg and three doses of 2 mg/kg mRNA-LNP. Editing was specific to the liver and the intended locus, and was sufficient to reduce blood L-phenylalanine (Phe) levels from over 1500 {micro}mol/l to below the therapeutic threshold of 600 {micro}mol/l. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo gene correction in the liver with transient PE expression, bringing prime editing closer to clinical application.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult stem cells occupy a niche that contributes to their function, but how stem cells remodel their microenvironment remains an open-ended question. Herein, biomaterials-based systems and metabolic labeling were utilized to evaluate how skeletal muscle stem cells deposit extracellular matrix. Muscle stem cells and committed myoblasts were observed to generate less nascent matrix than muscle resident fibro-adipogenic progenitors. When cultured on substrates that matched the stiffness of physiological uninjured and injured muscles, the increased nascent matrix deposition was associated with stem cell activation. Reducing the ability to deposit nascent matrix in muscle stem cells attenuated function and mimicked impairments observed from muscle stem cells isolated from old aged muscles, which could be rescued with therapeutic supplementation of insulin-like growth factors. These results highlight how nascent matrix production is critical for maintaining healthy stem cell function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized our ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA-based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, we report a fully automated method to produce sequence- and size-defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX-tile-based DNA nanotubes (and flexible wireframe DNA structures) are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single-molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self-assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self-assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (tthrough an ad-hoc developed K-means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single-molecule  assembly-analysis-optimization sequence can be used to generate complex, non-covalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, while excellent for preserving tissue for extended periods of time, poses a challenge when extracting molecular information. We therefore developed an easily adaptable and highly efficient workflow for extracting high levels of proteins from low-input material. We compared sensitivity between two stains, EpCAM and H&amp;E, across material inputs of ~2 and 1,600 cells. In the context of EpCAM-stained tissue, our investigations unveiled a range from ~1,200 unique protein groups at the lowest input to ~5,900 at the highest. For H&amp;E, the spectrum covers ~900 to ~5,200 protein groups. We found an optimal balance between maximizing detected proteins and minimizing input material to be within the range of ~100 to ~200 cells. With this knowledge, we tested the spatial capabilities by isolating specific cell populations, through Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), from three different tissue types, where we were able to identify tissue-specific signatures and prominent clustering of all cell populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Manipulating liquids is a ubiquitous need for experiments across numerous scientific disciplines. To overcome limitations of current methods, we introduce Surface Patterned Omniphobic Tiles (SPOTs). This platform combines geometry and surface engineering, building on discontinuous wetting approaches to leverage capillarity for metering liquids. The SPOTs platform allows manipulation of hundreds to thousands of independent experiments without expensive equipment or large consumable costs. These devices can handle a wide range of liquid types and volumes (&lt;10 nanoliters to &gt;10 microliters) with better precision than pipetting. The platform is inexpensive and easy to fabricate, fast and intuitive to use, and cross-compatible with existing microwell plate layouts. We demonstrate how these capabilities facilitate diverse experiments including testing antibiotic combinations for synergy and antagonism, material screening of perovskites, and genotyping microbial isolates. We anticipate SPOTs will enable users from disparate domains to quickly and easily run a wide range of high-throughput experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vascular malformation, a key clinical phenotype of Proteus syndrome, lacks effective models for pathophysiological study and drug development due to limited patient sample access. To bridge this gap, we built a human vascular organoid model replicating Proteus syndromes vasculature. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gene overexpression, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embodying the Proteus syndrome-specific AKTE17K point mutation for organoid generation. Our findings revealed that AKT overactivation in these organoids resulted in smaller sizes yet increased vascular connectivity, although with less stable connections. This could be due to the significant vasculogenesis induced by AKT overactivation. This phenomenon likely stems from boosted vasculogenesis triggered by AKT overactivation, leading to increased vascular sprouting. Additionally, a notable increase in dysfunctional PDGFR{beta} &#43; mural cells, impaired in matrix secretion, was observed in these AKT-overactivated organoids. The application of AKT inhibitors (ARQ092, AZD5363, or GDC0068) reversed the vascular malformations; the inhibitors effectiveness was directly linked to reduced connectivity in the organoids. In summary, our study introduces an innovative in vitro model combining organoid technology and gene editing to explore vascular pathophysiology in Proteus syndrome. This model not only simulates Proteus syndrome vasculature but also holds potential for mimicking vasculatures of other genetically driven diseases. It represents an advance in drug development for rare diseases, historically plagued by slow progress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Decellularized extracellular matrices (dECM) have strong regenerative potential as tissue engineering scaffolds; however, current clinical options for dECM are limited to freeze-drying its native form into sheets. Electrospinning is a versatile scaffold fabrication technique that allows control of macro- and microarchitecture. It remains challenging to electrospin dECM; which has led researchers to either blend it with synthetic materials or use enzymatic digestion to fully solubilize the dECM. Both strategies reduce the innate bioactivity of dECM and limit its regenerative potential. Herein, we developed a new suspension electrospinning method to fabricate a pure dECM scaffold that retains its innate bioactivity. Systematic investigation of suspension parameters was used to identify critical rheological properties required to instill spinnability, including homogenization, concentration, and particle size. Homogenization enhanced particle interaction to impart the requisite elastic behavior to withstand electrostatic drawing without breaking. A direct correlation between concentration and viscosity was observed that altered fiber morphology; whereas, particle size had minimal impact on suspension properties and fiber morphology. The versatility of this new method was demonstrated by electrospinning dECM with three common decellularization techniques (Abraham, Badylak, Luo) and tissue origins (intestinal submucosa, heart, skin). Bioactivity retention after electrospinning was confirmed using cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and macrophage assays. Collectively, these findings provide a framework for researchers to electrospin dECM for diverse tissue engineering applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the development of various drug delivery technologies, there remains a significant need for vehicles that can improve targeting and biodistribution in &#34;hard-to-penetrate&#34; tissues. Some solid tumors, for example, are particularly challenging to penetrate due to their dense extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we have formulated a new family of rod-shaped delivery vehicles named Janus base nanopieces (Rod JBNps), which are more slender than conventional spherical nanoparticles, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). These JBNp nanorods are formed by bundles of DNA-inspired Janus base nanotubes (JBNts) with intercalated delivery cargoes. To develop this novel family of delivery vehicles, we employed a computation-aided design (CAD) methodology that includes molecular dynamics and response surface methodology. This approach precisely and efficiently guides experimental designs. Using an ovarian cancer model, we demonstrated that JBNps markedly improve penetration into the dense ECM of solid tumors, leading to better treatment outcomes compared to FDA-approved spherical LNP delivery. This study not only successfully developed a rod-shaped delivery vehicle for improved tissue penetration but also established a CAD methodology to effectively guide material design.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leveraging the extensive surface area of the lungs for gene therapy, inhalation route offers distinct advantages for delivery. Clinical nebulizers that employ vibrating mesh technology are the standard choice for converting liquid medicines into aerosols. However, they have limitations when it comes to delivering mRNA through inhalation, including severe damage to nanoparticles due to shearing forces. Here, we introduce a novel microfluidic aerosolization platform (MAP) that preserves the structural and physicochemical integrity of lipid nanoparticles, enabling safe and efficient mRNA delivery to the respiratory system. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the novel MAP over the conventional vibrating mesh nebulizer, as it avoided problems such as particle aggregation, loss of mRNA encapsulation, and deformation of nanoparticle morphology. Notably, aerosolized nanoparticles generated by the microfluidic device led to enhanced transfection efficiency across various cell lines. In vivo experiments with mice that inhaled these aerosolized nanoparticles revealed successful, lung-specific mRNA transfection without observable signs of toxicity. This pioneering MAP represents a significant advancement for the pulmonary gene therapy, enabling precise and effective delivery of aerosolized nanoparticles.</p>
