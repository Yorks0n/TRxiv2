However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

A.; Burt, A.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550950\nWith recent advances in three-dimensional bioimaging acquisition and analysis methods, imaging data are an important tool for unveiling the complex architecture of biological organisms. However, extracting insights from these complex datasets requires interactive exploration as well as annotation for training supervised analytical methods. Here we present napari-threedee, a library of composable components and napari plugins for interactively exploring and annotating image data in 3D. We demonstrate how napari-threedee can be used for human-in-the-loop 3D image analysis in diverse image data including fluorescence microscopy and cryoelectron tomography.\nSonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites\nAuthors: Agrawal, P.; Zhuang, S.; Dreher, S.; Mitter, S.; Ahmed, D.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552292\nAdvancements in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed various fields in aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics, enabling fine-tuning material properties by reinforcing internal particles and adjusting their type, orientation, and volume fraction. This capability opens new possibilities for tailoring materials to specific applications and optimizing the performance of 3D-printed objects. Existing reinforcement strategies are restricted to pattern types, alignment areas, and particle characteristics. Alternatively, acoustics provide versatility by controlling particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge and can create intricate pattern formations. Despite the potential of acoustics in most 3D printing, limitation arises from the scattering of the acoustic field between the polymerized hard layers and the unpolymerized resin, leading to undesirable patterning formation. However, this challenge can be addressed by adopting a novel approach that involves simultaneous reinforcement and printing the entire structure. Here, we present SonoPrint, an acoustically-assisted volumetric 3D printer that produces mechanically tunable composite geometries by patterning reinforcement microparticles within the fabricated structure. SonoPrint creates a standing wave field that produces a targeted particle motif in the photosensitive resin while simultaneously printing the object in just a few minutes. We have also demonstrated various patterning configurations such as lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, quadrilaterals, and hexagons using microscopic particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene particles. Furthermore, we fabricated diverse composites using different resins, achieving 87 microns feature size. We have shown that the printed structure with patterned microparticles increased their tensile and compression strength by ~38% and ~75%, respectively.\nLarge-FOV 3D localization microscopy by spatially variant point spread function generation\nAuthors: Xiao, D.; Kedem Orange, R.; Opatovski, N.; Parizat, A.; Nehme, E.; Alalouf, O.; Shechtman, Y.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551150\nAccurate characterization of the microscopic point spread function (PSF) is crucial for achieving high-performance localization microscopy (LM). Traditionally, LM assumes a spatially-invariant PSF to simplify the modeling of the imaging system. However, for large fields of view (FOV) imaging, it becomes important to account for the spatially variant nature of the PSF. In this work, we propose an accurate and fast principal component analysis (PCA)-based field-dependent 3D PSF generator (PPG3D) and localizer for LM. Through simulations and experimental 3D single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), we demonstrate the effectiveness of PPG3D, enabling super-resolution imaging of mitochondria and microtubules with high fidelity over a large FOV. A comparison of PPG3D with three other shift-invariant and shift-variant PSF generators for 3D LM reveals a three-fold improvement in accuracy and an operation speed approximately one hundred times faster. Given its user-friendliness and conciseness, we believe that PPG3D holds great potential for widespread application in SMLM and other imaging modalities.\nMetabolic impact of heterologous protein production in Pseudomonas putida: Insights into carbon and energy flux control\nAuthors: Vogeleer, P.; Millard, P.; Ortega Arbulu, A.-S.; Pfluger-Grau, K.; Kremling, A.; Letisse, F.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550675\nFor engineered microorganisms, the expression of heterologous proteins that are often useless to host cells represents a burden on resources, which have to be shared with normal cellular processes. Within a certain metabolic leeway, this competitive process has no impact on growth. However, once this leeway, or free capacity, is fully utilized, the extra load becomes a metabolic burden that inhibits cellular processes and triggers a broad cellular response, reducing cell growth and often hindering the production of heterologous proteins. In this study, we sought to characterize the metabolic rearrangements occurring in the central metabolism of Pseudomonas putida at different levels of metabolic load. To this end, we constructed a P. putida KT2440 strain that expressed two genes encoding fluorescent proteins, one in the genome under constitutive expression to monitor the free capacity, and the other on an inducible plasmid to probe heterologous protein production. We found that metabolic fluxes are profoundly reshuffled, notably at the level of periplasmic pathways, as soon as the metabolic load exceeds the free capacity. Heterologous protein production leads to the decoupling of anabolism and catabolism, resulting in large excess energy production relative to the requirements of protein biosynthesis. Finally, heterologous protein production was found to exert a stronger control on carbon fluxes than on energy fluxes, indicating that the flexible nature of P. putidas central metabolic network is solicited to sustain energy production. HighlightsHeterologous protein production in P. putida reshuffles the periplasmic metabolism. Increased protein production progressively decouples catabolism from anabolism. Protein production exerts a stronger control on energy than on carbon fluxes. Glucose is directed towards ATP production to meet the elevated energy demands.\nSimple and rewireable biomolecular building blocks for DNA machine-learning algorithms\nAuthors: Lee, R. C.; Corsano, A.; Tseng, C. Y.; Chou, L. Y. T.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549967\nDeep learning algorithms, such as neural networks, enable the processing of complex datasets with many related variables, and have applications in disease diagnosis, cell profiling, and drug discovery. Beyond its use in electronic computers, neural networks have been implemented using programmable biomolecules such as DNA. This confers unique advantages such as greater portability, ability to operate without electricity, and direct analysis of patterns of biomolecules in solution. Analogous to past bottlenecks in electronic computers, the computing power of DNA-based neural networks is limited by the ability to add more computing units, i.e. neurons. This limitation exists because current architectures require many nucleic acids to model a single neuron. Each addition of a neuron to the network compounds existing problems such as long assembly times, high background signal, and cross-talk between components. Here we test three strategies to solve this limitation and improve the scalability of DNA-based neural networks: (i) enzymatic synthesis to generate high-purity neurons, (ii) spatial patterning of neuron clusters based on their network position, and (iii) encoding neuron connectivity on a universal single-stranded DNA backbone. We show that neurons implemented via these strategies activate quickly, with high signal-to-background ratio, and respond to varying input concentrations and weights. Using this neuron design, we implemented basic neural network motifs such as cascading, fan-in, and fan-out circuits. Since this design is modular, easy to synthesize, and compatible with multiple neural network architectures, we envision it will help scale DNA-based neural networks in a variety of settings. This will enable portable computing power for applications such as portable diagnostics, compact data storage, and autonomous decision making for lab-on-a-chips.\nDNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin for metastatic breast cancer treatment\nAuthors: Vaswani, P.; Hema, N. A.; Kansara, K.; Dahle, L.; Kumar, A.; Bhatia, D. D.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551657\nMetastatic breast cancer is a significant clinical challenge calling for novel and efficient therapeutic approaches. DNA tetrahedron, a highly programmable nanocage, offers some promising attributes including biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization making it an attractive candidate for drug delivery. In this study, we have explored the potential of DNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin, a DNA and RNA synthesis-inhibiting chemotherapy drug. We have encapsulated doxorubicin in DNA tetrahedron (TD: Dox) and subsequently focused on metastatic breast cancer cells for the effect of the same. We showed that TD: Dox has the potential to inhibit the migration of cancerous cells in the 2D model and inhibit the invasion of tumor cells in the 3D model as well. This system also can be uptaken in in vivo zebrafish model as well. Overall, this study promises the TD: Dox system as an ideal drug delivery model and a viable approach for metastatic breast cancer treatment.\nNuclear Factor Kappa B Over-Activation in the Intervertebral Disc Leads to Macrophage Recruitment and Severe Disc Degeneration\nAuthors: Burt, K. G.; Kim, M. K. M.; Viola, D. C.; Abraham, A. C.; Chahine, N. O.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552274\nObjective: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of global disability and is thought to be driven primarily by intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (DD). Persistent upregulation of catabolic enzymes and inflammatory mediators have been associated with severe cases of DD. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) is a master transcription regulator of immune responses and is over expressed during inflammatory-driven musculoskeletal diseases, including DD. However, its role in triggering DD is unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of NF-{kappa}B pathway over-activation on IVD integrity and DD pathology. Methods: Using skeletally mature mouse model, we genetically targeted IVD cells for canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway activation via expression of a constitutively active form of inhibitor of {kappa}B kinase B (IKK{beta}), and assessed changes in IVD cellularity, structural integrity including histology, disc height, and extracellular matrix (ECM) biochemistry, biomechanics, expression of inflammatory, catabolic, and neurotropic mediators, and changes in macrophage subsets, longitudinally up to 6-months post activation. Results: Prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation led to severe structural degeneration, with a loss of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and complete loss of nucleus pulposus (NP) cellularity. Structural and compositional changes decreased IVD height and compressive mechanical properties with prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation. These alterations were accompanied by increases in gene expression of inflammatory molecules (Il1b, Il6, Nos2), chemokines (Mcp1, Mif), catabolic enzymes (Mmp3, Mmp9, Adamts4), and neurotrophic factors (Bdnf, Ngf) within IVD tissue. Increased recruitment of activated F4/80+ macrophages exhibited a greater abundance of pro-inflammatory (CD38+) over inflammatory-resolving (CD206+) macrophage subsets in the IVD, with temporal changes in the relative abundance of macrophage subsets over time, providing evidence for temporal regulation of macrophage polarization in DD in vivo, where macrophages participate in resolving the inflammatory cascade but promote fibrotic transformation of the IVD matrix. We further show that NF-{kappa}B driven secretory factors from IVD cells increase macrophage migration and inflammatory activation, and that the secretome of inflammatory-resolving macrophages mitigates effects of NF-{kappa}B overactivation. Conclusion: Overall the observed results suggest prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation can induce severe DD, acting through increases in inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic proteins, catabolic enzymes, and the recruitment and inflammatory activation of a macrophage cell populations, that can be mitigated with inflammatory-resolving macrophage secretome.\nDeep Learning-Enabled, Detection of Rare Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters in Whole Blood Using Label-free, Flow Cytometry\nAuthors: Vora, N.; Shekhar, P.; Esmail, M.; Patra, A.; Georgakoudi, I.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551485\nMetastatic tumors have poor prognoses for progression-free and overall survival for all cancer patients. Rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and rarer circulating tumor cell clusters (CTCCs) are potential biomarkers of metastatic growth, with CTCCs representing an increased risk factor for metastasis. Current detection platforms are optimized for ex vivo detection of CTCs only. Microfluidic chips and size exclusion methods have been proposed for CTCC detection; however, they lack in vivo utility and real-time monitoring capability. Confocal backscatter and fluorescence flow cytometry (BSFC) has been used for label-free detection of CTCCs in whole blood based on machine learning (ML) enabled peak classification. Here, we expand to a deep-learning (DL) -based, peak detection and classification model to detect CTCCs in whole blood data. We demonstrate that DL-based BSFC has a low false alarm rate of 0.78 events/min with a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.943 between detected events and expected events. DL-based BSFC of whole blood maintains a detection purity of 72% and a sensitivity of 35.3% for both homotypic and heterotypic CTCCs starting at a minimum size of two cells. We also demonstrate through artificial spiking studies that DL-based BSFC is sensitive to changes in the number of CTCCs present in the samples and does not add variability in detection beyond the expected variability from Poisson statistics. The performance established by DL-based BSFC motivates its use for in vivo detection of CTCCs. Further developments of label-free BSFC to enhance throughput could lead to critical applications in the clinical detection of CTCCs and ex vivo isolation of CTCC from whole blood with minimal disruption and processing steps.\nConductive microgel annealed scaffolds enhance myogenic potential of myoblastic cells\nAuthors: Casella, A.; Lowen, J.; Shimamoto, N.; Griffin, K. H.; Filler, A. C.; Panitch, A.; Leach, K.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551533\nBioelectricity is an understudied phenomenon to guide tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Conductive biomaterials may capture native or exogenous bioelectric signaling, but incorporation of conductive moieties is limited by cytotoxicity, poor injectability, or insufficient stimulation. Microgel annealed scaffolds are promising as hydrogel-based materials due to their inherent void space that facilitates cell migration and proliferation better than nanoporous bulk hydrogels. We generated conductive microgels from poly(ethylene) glycol and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) to explore the interplay of void volume and conductivity on myogenic differentiation. PEDOT:PSS increased microgel conductivity over 2-fold while maintaining stiffness, annealing strength, and viability of associated myoblastic cells. C2C12 myoblasts exhibited increases in the late-stage differentiation marker myosin heavy chain as a function of both porosity and conductivity. Myogenin, an earlier marker, was influenced only by porosity. Human skeletal muscle derived cells exhibited increased Myod1, IGF-1, and IGFBP-2 at earlier timepoints on conductive microgel scaffolds compared to non-conductive scaffolds. They also secreted higher levels of VEGF at early timepoints and expressed factors that led to macrophage polarization patterns observed during muscle repair. These data indicate that conductivity aids myogenic differentiation of myogenic cell lines and primary cells, motivating the need for future translational studies to promote muscle repair.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Targeting nanoparticle therapeutics with cellular accuracy in whole organisms could open breakthrough opportunities in precision medicine. However, evaluating and fine-tuning the biodistribution of such systems in the whole organism at the cellular level remains a major obstacle. Here, we constructed targetable DNA origami, and analyzed biodistribution in transparent mice, in addition to studying tolerability, clearance kinetics, and immune response parameters. Untargeted DNA origami primarily accumulated in the spleen and the liver, while an immune cell-targeting variant successfully attached to immune cells throughout the body. A cancer cell-targeting mimetic co-localized on solid-tumor metastasis in the liver and the lung. These findings indicate that DNA origami can be directed in vivo, providing an important proof-of-concept and highlights the potential of high-resolution tissue-clearing imaging technologies in their development.

        <p class="abstract">With recent advances in three-dimensional bioimaging acquisition and analysis methods, imaging data are an important tool for unveiling the complex architecture of biological organisms. However, extracting insights from these complex datasets requires interactive exploration as well as annotation for training supervised analytical methods. Here we present napari-threedee, a library of composable components and napari plugins for interactively exploring and annotating image data in 3D. We demonstrate how napari-threedee can be used for human-in-the-loop 3D image analysis in diverse image data including fluorescence microscopy and cryoelectron tomography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advancements in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed various fields in aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics, enabling fine-tuning material properties by reinforcing internal particles and adjusting their type, orientation, and volume fraction. This capability opens new possibilities for tailoring materials to specific applications and optimizing the performance of 3D-printed objects. Existing reinforcement strategies are restricted to pattern types, alignment areas, and particle characteristics. Alternatively, acoustics provide versatility by controlling particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge and can create intricate pattern formations. Despite the potential of acoustics in most 3D printing, limitation arises from the scattering of the acoustic field between the polymerized hard layers and the unpolymerized resin, leading to undesirable patterning formation. However, this challenge can be addressed by adopting a novel approach that involves simultaneous reinforcement and printing the entire structure. Here, we present SonoPrint, an acoustically-assisted volumetric 3D printer that produces mechanically tunable composite geometries by patterning reinforcement microparticles within the fabricated structure. SonoPrint creates a standing wave field that produces a targeted particle motif in the photosensitive resin while simultaneously printing the object in just a few minutes. We have also demonstrated various patterning configurations such as lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, quadrilaterals, and hexagons using microscopic particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene particles. Furthermore, we fabricated diverse composites using different resins, achieving 87 microns feature size. We have shown that the printed structure with patterned microparticles increased their tensile and compression strength by ~38% and ~75%, respectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate characterization of the microscopic point spread function (PSF) is crucial for achieving high-performance localization microscopy (LM). Traditionally, LM assumes a spatially-invariant PSF to simplify the modeling of the imaging system. However, for large fields of view (FOV) imaging, it becomes important to account for the spatially variant nature of the PSF. In this work, we propose an accurate and fast principal component analysis (PCA)-based field-dependent 3D PSF generator (PPG3D) and localizer for LM. Through simulations and experimental 3D single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), we demonstrate the effectiveness of PPG3D, enabling super-resolution imaging of mitochondria and microtubules with high fidelity over a large FOV. A comparison of PPG3D with three other shift-invariant and shift-variant PSF generators for 3D LM reveals a three-fold improvement in accuracy and an operation speed approximately one hundred times faster. Given its user-friendliness and conciseness, we believe that PPG3D holds great potential for widespread application in SMLM and other imaging modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For engineered microorganisms, the expression of heterologous proteins that are often useless to host cells represents a burden on resources, which have to be shared with normal cellular processes. Within a certain metabolic leeway, this competitive process has no impact on growth. However, once this leeway, or free capacity, is fully utilized, the extra load becomes a metabolic burden that inhibits cellular processes and triggers a broad cellular response, reducing cell growth and often hindering the production of heterologous proteins. In this study, we sought to characterize the metabolic rearrangements occurring in the central metabolism of Pseudomonas putida at different levels of metabolic load. To this end, we constructed a P. putida KT2440 strain that expressed two genes encoding fluorescent proteins, one in the genome under constitutive expression to monitor the free capacity, and the other on an inducible plasmid to probe heterologous protein production. We found that metabolic fluxes are profoundly reshuffled, notably at the level of periplasmic pathways, as soon as the metabolic load exceeds the free capacity. Heterologous protein production leads to the decoupling of anabolism and catabolism, resulting in large excess energy production relative to the requirements of protein biosynthesis. Finally, heterologous protein production was found to exert a stronger control on carbon fluxes than on energy fluxes, indicating that the flexible nature of P. putidas central metabolic network is solicited to sustain energy production.

HighlightsHeterologous protein production in P. putida reshuffles the periplasmic metabolism. Increased protein production progressively decouples catabolism from anabolism. Protein production exerts a stronger control on energy than on carbon fluxes. Glucose is directed towards ATP production to meet the elevated energy demands.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep learning algorithms, such as neural networks, enable the processing of complex datasets with many related variables, and have applications in disease diagnosis, cell profiling, and drug discovery. Beyond its use in electronic computers, neural networks have been implemented using programmable biomolecules such as DNA. This confers unique advantages such as greater portability, ability to operate without electricity, and direct analysis of patterns of biomolecules in solution. Analogous to past bottlenecks in electronic computers, the computing power of DNA-based neural networks is limited by the ability to add more computing units, i.e. neurons. This limitation exists because current architectures require many nucleic acids to model a single neuron. Each addition of a neuron to the network compounds existing problems such as long assembly times, high background signal, and cross-talk between components. Here we test three strategies to solve this limitation and improve the scalability of DNA-based neural networks: (i) enzymatic synthesis to generate high-purity neurons, (ii) spatial patterning of neuron clusters based on their network position, and (iii) encoding neuron connectivity on a universal single-stranded DNA backbone. We show that neurons implemented via these strategies activate quickly, with high signal-to-background ratio, and respond to varying input concentrations and weights. Using this neuron design, we implemented basic neural network motifs such as cascading, fan-in, and fan-out circuits. Since this design is modular, easy to synthesize, and compatible with multiple neural network architectures, we envision it will help scale DNA-based neural networks in a variety of settings. This will enable portable computing power for applications such as portable diagnostics, compact data storage, and autonomous decision making for lab-on-a-chips.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metastatic breast cancer is a significant clinical challenge calling for novel and efficient therapeutic approaches. DNA tetrahedron, a highly programmable nanocage, offers some promising attributes including biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization making it an attractive candidate for drug delivery. In this study, we have explored the potential of DNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin, a DNA and RNA synthesis-inhibiting chemotherapy drug. We have encapsulated doxorubicin in DNA tetrahedron (TD: Dox) and subsequently focused on metastatic breast cancer cells for the effect of the same. We showed that TD: Dox has the potential to inhibit the migration of cancerous cells in the 2D model and inhibit the invasion of tumor cells in the 3D model as well. This system also can be uptaken in in vivo zebrafish model as well. Overall, this study promises the TD: Dox system as an ideal drug delivery model and a viable approach for metastatic breast cancer treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of global disability and is thought to be driven primarily by intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (DD). Persistent upregulation of catabolic enzymes and inflammatory mediators have been associated with severe cases of DD. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) is a master transcription regulator of immune responses and is over expressed during inflammatory-driven musculoskeletal diseases, including DD. However, its role in triggering DD is unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of NF-{kappa}B pathway over-activation on IVD integrity and DD pathology. Methods: Using skeletally mature mouse model, we genetically targeted IVD cells for canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway activation via expression of a constitutively active form of inhibitor of {kappa}B kinase B (IKK{beta}), and assessed changes in IVD cellularity, structural integrity including histology, disc height, and extracellular matrix (ECM) biochemistry, biomechanics, expression of inflammatory, catabolic, and neurotropic mediators, and changes in macrophage subsets, longitudinally up to 6-months post activation. Results: Prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation led to severe structural degeneration, with a loss of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and complete loss of nucleus pulposus (NP) cellularity. Structural and compositional changes decreased IVD height and compressive mechanical properties with prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation. These alterations were accompanied by increases in gene expression of inflammatory molecules (Il1b, Il6, Nos2), chemokines (Mcp1, Mif), catabolic enzymes (Mmp3, Mmp9, Adamts4), and neurotrophic factors (Bdnf, Ngf) within IVD tissue. Increased recruitment of activated F4/80&#43; macrophages exhibited a greater abundance of pro-inflammatory (CD38&#43;) over inflammatory-resolving (CD206&#43;) macrophage subsets in the IVD, with temporal changes in the relative abundance of macrophage subsets over time, providing evidence for temporal regulation of macrophage polarization in DD in vivo, where macrophages participate in resolving the inflammatory cascade but promote fibrotic transformation of the IVD matrix. We further show that NF-{kappa}B driven secretory factors from IVD cells increase macrophage migration and inflammatory activation, and that the secretome of inflammatory-resolving macrophages mitigates effects of NF-{kappa}B overactivation. Conclusion: Overall the observed results suggest prolonged NF-{kappa}B activation can induce severe DD, acting through increases in inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic proteins, catabolic enzymes, and the recruitment and inflammatory activation of a macrophage cell populations, that can be mitigated with inflammatory-resolving macrophage secretome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metastatic tumors have poor prognoses for progression-free and overall survival for all cancer patients. Rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and rarer circulating tumor cell clusters (CTCCs) are potential biomarkers of metastatic growth, with CTCCs representing an increased risk factor for metastasis. Current detection platforms are optimized for ex vivo detection of CTCs only. Microfluidic chips and size exclusion methods have been proposed for CTCC detection; however, they lack in vivo utility and real-time monitoring capability. Confocal backscatter and fluorescence flow cytometry (BSFC) has been used for label-free detection of CTCCs in whole blood based on machine learning (ML) enabled peak classification. Here, we expand to a deep-learning (DL) -based, peak detection and classification model to detect CTCCs in whole blood data. We demonstrate that DL-based BSFC has a low false alarm rate of 0.78 events/min with a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.943 between detected events and expected events. DL-based BSFC of whole blood maintains a detection purity of 72% and a sensitivity of 35.3% for both homotypic and heterotypic CTCCs starting at a minimum size of two cells. We also demonstrate through artificial spiking studies that DL-based BSFC is sensitive to changes in the number of CTCCs present in the samples and does not add variability in detection beyond the expected variability from Poisson statistics. The performance established by DL-based BSFC motivates its use for in vivo detection of CTCCs. Further developments of label-free BSFC to enhance throughput could lead to critical applications in the clinical detection of CTCCs and ex vivo isolation of CTCC from whole blood with minimal disruption and processing steps.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bioelectricity is an understudied phenomenon to guide tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Conductive biomaterials may capture native or exogenous bioelectric signaling, but incorporation of conductive moieties is limited by cytotoxicity, poor injectability, or insufficient stimulation. Microgel annealed scaffolds are promising as hydrogel-based materials due to their inherent void space that facilitates cell migration and proliferation better than nanoporous bulk hydrogels. We generated conductive microgels from poly(ethylene) glycol and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) to explore the interplay of void volume and conductivity on myogenic differentiation. PEDOT:PSS increased microgel conductivity over 2-fold while maintaining stiffness, annealing strength, and viability of associated myoblastic cells. C2C12 myoblasts exhibited increases in the late-stage differentiation marker myosin heavy chain as a function of both porosity and conductivity. Myogenin, an earlier marker, was influenced only by porosity. Human skeletal muscle derived cells exhibited increased Myod1, IGF-1, and IGFBP-2 at earlier timepoints on conductive microgel scaffolds compared to non-conductive scaffolds. They also secreted higher levels of VEGF at early timepoints and expressed factors that led to macrophage polarization patterns observed during muscle repair. These data indicate that conductivity aids myogenic differentiation of myogenic cell lines and primary cells, motivating the need for future translational studies to promote muscle repair.</p>
