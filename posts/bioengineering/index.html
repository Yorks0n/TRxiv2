C.; Malounda, D.; Yao, Y.; Shapiro, M. G.\nScore: 73.2, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566364\nCalcium imaging has enabled major biological discoveries. However, the scattering of light by tissue limits the use of standard fluorescent calcium indicators in living animals. To address this limitation, we introduce the first genetically encoded ultrasonic reporter of calcium (URoC). Based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles, we engineered URoC to produce elevated nonlinear ultrasound signal upon binding to calcium ions. With URoC expressed in mammalian cells, we demonstrate noninvasive ultrasound imaging of calcium signaling in vivo during drug-induced receptor activation. URoC brings the depth and resolution advantages of ultrasound to the in vivo imaging of dynamic cellular function and paves the way for acoustic biosensing of a broader variety of biological signals.\nRho/ROCK activity tunes cell compartment segregation and differentiation in nephron-forming niches\nAuthors: Viola, J. M.; Liu, J.; Huang, A.; Grindel, S. H.; Prahl, L. S.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566308\nControlling the time and place of nephron formation in vitro would improve nephron density and connectivity in next-generation kidney replacement tissues. Recent developments in kidney organoid technology have paved the way to achieving self-sustaining nephrogenic niches in vitro. The physical and geometric structure of the niche are key control parameters in tissue engineering approaches. However, their relationship to nephron differentiation is unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between niche geometry, cell compartment mixing, and nephron differentiation by targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway, a master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. We find that the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases mixing between nephron progenitor and stromal compartments in native mouse embryonic kidney niches, and also increases nephrogenesis. Similar increases are also seen in reductionist mouse primary cell and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids perturbed by Y-27632, dependent on the presence of stromal cells. Our data indicate that niche organization is a determinant of nephron formation rate, bringing renewed focus to the spatial context of cell-cell interactions in kidney tissue engineering efforts.\nRapid spectrophotometric detection for optimized production of landomycins and characterization of their therapeutic potential\nAuthors: Chappell, T. C.; Maiello, K. G.; Tierny, A. J.; Yanagi, K.; Lee, J. A.; Lee, K.; Mace, C. R.; Bennett, C. S.; Nair, N. U.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566088\nMicrobial derived natural products remain a major source of structurally diverse bioactive compounds and chemical scaffolds that have potential as new therapeutics to target drug resistant pathogens and cancers. In particular, genome mining has revealed the vast number of cryptic or low yield biosynthetic gene clusters in the genus Streptomyces. Here, we describe our efforts to improve yields of landomycins - angucycline family polyketides under investigation as cancer therapeutics - by a genetically modified Streptomyces cyanogenus 136. After simplifying the extraction process from S. cyanogenus cultures, we identified a wavelength at which the major landomycin products absorb in culture extracts, which we used to systematically explore culture medium compositions to improve total landomycin titers. Through correlational analysis, we simplified the culture optimization process by identifying an alternative wavelength at which culture supernatants absorb yet is representative of total landomycin titers. Using the subsequently improved sample throughput, we explored landomycin production during the culturing process to further increase landomycin yield and reduce culture time. Testing the antimicrobial activity of the isolated landomycins, we report broad inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria, inhibition of fungi by landomycinone, and broad landomycin resistance by Gram-negative bacteria that is likely mediated by exclusion of landomycins by the bacterial membrane. Finally, the anticancer activity of the isolated landomycins against A549 lung carcinoma cells agrees with previous reports on other cell lines that glycan chain length correlates with activity. Given the prevalence of natural products produced by Streptomyces, as well as the light-absorbing moieties common to bioactive natural products and their metabolic precursors, our method is relevant to improving the yields of other natural products of interest.\nDNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Cargo Transfer\nAuthors: Buber, E.; Yaadav, R.; Schroeder, T.; Franquelim, H. G.; Tinnefeld, P.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565475\nInteracting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.\nSequential image classification of human-robot walking environments using temporal neural networks\nAuthors: Ivanyuk-Skulskiy, B.; Kurbis, A. G.; Mihailidis, A.; Laschowski, B.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566555\nRobotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons require real-time and accurate estimation of the walking environment for smooth transitions between different locomotion mode controllers. However, previous studies have mainly been limited to static image classification, therein ignoring the temporal dynamics of human-robot locomotion. Motivated by these limitations, here we developed several state-of-the-art temporal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compare the performances between static vs. sequential image classification of real-world walking environments (i.e., level-ground terrain, incline stairs, and transitions to and from stairs). Using our large-scale image dataset, we trained a number of encoder networks such as VGG, MobileNetV2, ViT, and MobileViT, each coupled with a temporal long short-term memory (LSTM) backbone. We also trained MoViNet, a new video classification model designed for mobile and embedded devices, to further compare the performances between 2D and 3D temporal deep learning models. Our 3D network outperformed all the hybrid 2D encoders with LSTM backbones and the 2D CNN baseline model in terms of classification accuracy, suggesting that network architecture can play an important role in performance. However, although our 3D neural network achieved the highest classification accuracy, it had disproportionally higher computational and memory storage requirements, which can be disadvantageous for real-time control of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons with limited onboard resources.\nRecreating the Biological Steps of Viral Infection on a Bioelectronic Platform to Profile Viral Variants of Concern\nAuthors: Chao, Z.; Selivanovitch, E.; Kallitsis, K.; Lu, Z.; Pachaury, A.; Owens, R.; Daniel, S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566634\nViral mutation rates frequently outpace the development of technologies used to detect and identify harmful variants; for SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), these are called variants of concern (VOC). Given the continual emergence of VOC, there is a critical need to develop platforms that can identify the presence of a virus and readily identify its propensity for infection. We present an electronic biomembrane sensing platform that recreates the multifaceted and sequential biological cues that give rise to distinct SARS-CoV-2 virus host cell entry pathways and reports the progression of entry steps of these pathways as electrical signals. Within these electrical signals, two necessary entry processes mediated by the viral Spike protein, virus binding and membrane fusion, can be distinguished. Remarkably, we find that closely related VOC exhibit distinct fusion signatures that correlate with trends reported in cell-based infectivity assays, allowing us to report quantitative differences in fusion characteristics among them that inform their infectivity potentials. This cell-free biomimetic infection platform also has a virus-free option that equally reports infectivity potential of the Spike proteins. We used SARS-CoV-2 as our prototype, but we anticipate that this platform will extend to other enveloped viruses and cell lines to quantifiably explore virus/host interactions. This advance should aid in faster determination of entry characteristics and fusogenicities of future VOC, necessary for rapid response.\nDissecting Multiparametric Cerebral Hemodynamics using Integrated Ultrafast Ultrasound and Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging\nAuthors: Chen, H.; Mirg, S.; Gaddale, P.; Agrawal, S.; Li, M.; Nguyen, V.; Xu, T.; Li, Q.; Liu, J.; Tu, W.; Liu, X.; Drew, P. J.; Zhang, N.; Gluckman, B. J.; Kothpalli, S.-R.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566048\nUnderstanding brain-wide hemodynamic responses to different stimuli at high spatiotemporal resolutions can help study neuro-disorders and brain functions. However, the existing brain imaging technologies have limited resolution, sensitivity, imaging depth and provide information about only one or two hemodynamic parameters. To address this, we propose a multimodal functional ultrasound and photoacoustic (fUSPA) imaging platform, which integrates ultrafast ultrasound and multispectral photoacoustic imaging methods in a compact head-mountable device, to quantitatively map cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation (SO2) dynamics as well as contrast agent enhanced brain imaging with high spatiotemporal resolutions. After systematic characterization, the fUSPA system was applied to quantitatively study the changes in brain hemodynamics and vascular reactivity at single vessel resolution in response to hypercapnia stimulation. Our results show an overall increase in brain-wide CBV, CBF, and SO2, but regional differences in singular cortical veins and arteries and a reproducible anti-correlation pattern between venous and cortical hemodynamics, demonstrating the capabilities of the fUSPA system for providing multiparametric cerebrovascular information at high-resolution and sensitivity, that can bring insights into the complex mechanisms of neurodiseases.\nImpact of central carbon metabolism bypasses on the production of beta-carotene in Yarrowa lipolytica\nAuthors: Markus, T.; Soldat, M.; Magdevska, V.; Horvat, J.; Kavscek, M.; Kosec, G.; Fujs, S.; Petrovic, U.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566616\nYarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast with ever growing popularity in the metabolic engineering circles. It is well known for its ability to accommodate a high carbon flux through acetyl-CoA and is being extensively studied for production of chemicals derived from it. We investigated the effects of modifying the upstream metabolism leading to acetyl-CoA on beta-carotene production, including its titer, yield, and content. We examined the pyruvate and the phosphoketolase bypass, both of which are stoichiometrically favorable for the production of acetyl-CoA and beta-carotene. Additionally, we examined a set of genes involved in the carnitine shuttle. We constructed a set of parental strains derived from the Y. lipolytica YB-392 wild-type strain, each with a different capacity for beta-carotene production, and introduced genes for the metabolic bypasses in each of the constructed parental strains. Subsequently, we subjected these constructed strains to a series of fermentation experiments. We discovered that altering the upstream metabolism in most cases led to a decrease in performance for production of beta-carotene. Most notably, a set of genes used for the pyruvate bypass (YlPDC2, YlALD5, and YlACS1) and the phosphoketolase bypass (LmXPK and CkPTA) resulted in the reduction of more than 30%. Our findings contribute to our understanding of Y. lipolytica's metabolic capacity and suggest that production of beta-carotene is most likely not limited solely by the acetyl-CoA supply. We also highlight a complex nature of engineering Y. lipolytica, as most of the results from studies using a different strain background did not align with our findings.\nDesign of parallel ????-sheet nanofibrils using Monte-Carlo search, coarse-grained simulations, and experimental testing\nAuthors: Sarma, S.; Sudarshan, T. R.; Nguyen, V.; Robang, A. S.; Xiao, X.; Le, J. V.; Helmicki, M. E.; Paravastu, A. K.; Hall, C. K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.565678\nPeptide self-assembly into amyloid fibrils provides numerous applications in drug delivery and biomedical engineering applications. We augment our previously-established computational screening technique along with experimental biophysical characterization to discover 7-mer peptides that self-assemble into (parallel {beta}-sheets), i.e., {beta}-sheets with N-terminus-to-C-terminus {beta}-strand vectors oriented in parallel. To accomplish the desired {beta}-strand organization, we applied the PepAD amino acid sequence design software to the Class-1 cross-{beta} spine defined by Sawaya et al. This molecular configuration includes two layers of parallel {beta}-sheets stacked such that N-terminus-to-C-terminus vectors are oriented antiparallel for molecules on adjacent {beta}-sheets. The first cohort of PepAD identified peptides were examined for their fibrillation behavior in DMD/PRIME20 simulations, and the top performing sequence was selected as a prototype for a subsequent round of sequence refinement. The two rounds of design resulted in a library of eight 7-mer peptides. In DMD/PRIME20 simulations, five of these peptides spontaneously formed fibril-like structures with a predominantly parallel {beta}-sheet arrangement, two formed fibril-like structure with \u003c50% in parallel {beta}-sheet arrangement and one remained a random coil. Among the eight candidate peptides produced by PepAD and DMD/PRIME20, five were synthesized and purified. All five assembled into amyloid fibrils composed of parallel {beta}-sheets based on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism, Electron Microscopy, and Thioflavin-T fluorescence spectroscopy measurements.\nDesign and fabrication of flexible biodegradable microelectrode array for recording electrocorticography signals\nAuthors: CHATTERJEE, S.; JOSHI, R. K.; BHASKARA, S.; R S, H.; DATTA, S.; KV, S. G.; PANDYA, H. J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566132\nConventional flexible implantable microelectrode arrays, used for real-time brain activity monitoring, incur minimal tissue damage due to their flexibility; however, these require retrieval surgery, causing trauma to subjects. Implants, fabricated using biodegradable materials, dissolve gradually in body fluid, eliminating the necessity for retrieval surgery. This work reports designing and developing a 10-channel flexible biodegradable microelectrode array to acquire electrocorticography signals from rats brains. The array was fabricated using tungsten, a transient metal, and PLLA:PCL (80:20), a biodegradable composite polymer. The subdural implantation of the array on the somatosensory cortex of rats (n=3) facilitated electrical biopotentials acquisition using OpenBCI Cyton Boards. The baseline activities, the induced epileptic discharges after peripheral electrical stimulation, and the recovered baseline activities after antiepileptic drug administration were recorded from sedated rats. The chronic baselines and evoked activities were also acquired from awake rats. The gradual decline of chronic baselines was evident, suggesting a possible dissolution of electrodes. Furthermore, the time-frequency analyses demonstrate the differences between baselines and induced epileptic activities. The signals recorded from microelectrode arrays demonstrate their potential to monitor brain activities in a chronic study. Histology of the harvested vital organs from the euthanized rats confirmed minimal tissue damage due to implantation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Calcium imaging has enabled major biological discoveries. However, the scattering of light by tissue limits the use of standard fluorescent calcium indicators in living animals. To address this limitation, we introduce the first genetically encoded ultrasonic reporter of calcium (URoC). Based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles, we engineered URoC to produce elevated nonlinear ultrasound signal upon binding to calcium ions. With URoC expressed in mammalian cells, we demonstrate noninvasive ultrasound imaging of calcium signaling in vivo during drug-induced receptor activation. URoC brings the depth and resolution advantages of ultrasound to the in vivo imaging of dynamic cellular function and paves the way for acoustic biosensing of a broader variety of biological signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Controlling the time and place of nephron formation in vitro would improve nephron density and connectivity in next-generation kidney replacement tissues. Recent developments in kidney organoid technology have paved the way to achieving self-sustaining nephrogenic niches in vitro. The physical and geometric structure of the niche are key control parameters in tissue engineering approaches. However, their relationship to nephron differentiation is unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between niche geometry, cell compartment mixing, and nephron differentiation by targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway, a master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. We find that the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases mixing between nephron progenitor and stromal compartments in native mouse embryonic kidney niches, and also increases nephrogenesis. Similar increases are also seen in reductionist mouse primary cell and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids perturbed by Y-27632, dependent on the presence of stromal cells. Our data indicate that niche organization is a determinant of nephron formation rate, bringing renewed focus to the spatial context of cell-cell interactions in kidney tissue engineering efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial derived natural products remain a major source of structurally diverse bioactive compounds and chemical scaffolds that have potential as new therapeutics to target drug resistant pathogens and cancers. In particular, genome mining has revealed the vast number of cryptic or low yield biosynthetic gene clusters in the genus Streptomyces. Here, we describe our efforts to improve yields of landomycins - angucycline family polyketides under investigation as cancer therapeutics - by a genetically modified Streptomyces cyanogenus 136. After simplifying the extraction process from S. cyanogenus cultures, we identified a wavelength at which the major landomycin products absorb in culture extracts, which we used to systematically explore culture medium compositions to improve total landomycin titers. Through correlational analysis, we simplified the culture optimization process by identifying an alternative wavelength at which culture supernatants absorb yet is representative of total landomycin titers. Using the subsequently improved sample throughput, we explored landomycin production during the culturing process to further increase landomycin yield and reduce culture time. Testing the antimicrobial activity of the isolated landomycins, we report broad inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria, inhibition of fungi by landomycinone, and broad landomycin resistance by Gram-negative bacteria that is likely mediated by exclusion of landomycins by the bacterial membrane. Finally, the anticancer activity of the isolated landomycins against A549 lung carcinoma cells agrees with previous reports on other cell lines that glycan chain length correlates with activity. Given the prevalence of natural products produced by Streptomyces, as well as the light-absorbing moieties common to bioactive natural products and their metabolic precursors, our method is relevant to improving the yields of other natural products of interest.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Leveraging the programmable nature of DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor harnessing single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a rectangular DNA origami. In a vesicle-free environment, the ssDNA adopts a coiled stance, ensuring high FRET efficiency. However, upon lipid vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, the hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, leading to reduced FRET efficiency. The strategic placement of cholesterol anchors further modulates this interaction, affecting the observed FRET populations. Beyond its role as a vesicle sensor, we show targeted cargo transport of the acceptor dye unit to the vesicle. The cargo transport is initiated by vesicle bound DNA and a strand displacement reaction. Our interaction platform opens pathways for innovative interaction such as biosensing and molecular transport with complex biosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Robotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons require real-time and accurate estimation of the walking environment for smooth transitions between different locomotion mode controllers. However, previous studies have mainly been limited to static image classification, therein ignoring the temporal dynamics of human-robot locomotion. Motivated by these limitations, here we developed several state-of-the-art temporal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compare the performances between static vs. sequential image classification of real-world walking environments (i.e., level-ground terrain, incline stairs, and transitions to and from stairs). Using our large-scale image dataset, we trained a number of encoder networks such as VGG, MobileNetV2, ViT, and MobileViT, each coupled with a temporal long short-term memory (LSTM) backbone. We also trained MoViNet, a new video classification model designed for mobile and embedded devices, to further compare the performances between 2D and 3D temporal deep learning models. Our 3D network outperformed all the hybrid 2D encoders with LSTM backbones and the 2D CNN baseline model in terms of classification accuracy, suggesting that network architecture can play an important role in performance. However, although our 3D neural network achieved the highest classification accuracy, it had disproportionally higher computational and memory storage requirements, which can be disadvantageous for real-time control of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons with limited onboard resources.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viral mutation rates frequently outpace the development of technologies used to detect and identify harmful variants; for SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), these are called variants of concern (VOC). Given the continual emergence of VOC, there is a critical need to develop platforms that can identify the presence of a virus and readily identify its propensity for infection. We present an electronic biomembrane sensing platform that recreates the multifaceted and sequential biological cues that give rise to distinct SARS-CoV-2 virus host cell entry pathways and reports the progression of entry steps of these pathways as electrical signals. Within these electrical signals, two necessary entry processes mediated by the viral Spike protein, virus binding and membrane fusion, can be distinguished. Remarkably, we find that closely related VOC exhibit distinct fusion signatures that correlate with trends reported in cell-based infectivity assays, allowing us to report quantitative differences in fusion characteristics among them that inform their infectivity potentials. This cell-free biomimetic infection platform also has a virus-free option that equally reports infectivity potential of the Spike proteins. We used SARS-CoV-2 as our prototype, but we anticipate that this platform will extend to other enveloped viruses and cell lines to quantifiably explore virus/host interactions. This advance should aid in faster determination of entry characteristics and fusogenicities of future VOC, necessary for rapid response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding brain-wide hemodynamic responses to different stimuli at high spatiotemporal resolutions can help study neuro-disorders and brain functions. However, the existing brain imaging technologies have limited resolution, sensitivity, imaging depth and provide information about only one or two hemodynamic parameters. To address this, we propose a multimodal functional ultrasound and photoacoustic (fUSPA) imaging platform, which integrates ultrafast ultrasound and multispectral photoacoustic imaging methods in a compact head-mountable device, to quantitatively map cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation (SO2) dynamics as well as contrast agent enhanced brain imaging with high spatiotemporal resolutions. After systematic characterization, the fUSPA system was applied to quantitatively study the changes in brain hemodynamics and vascular reactivity at single vessel resolution in response to hypercapnia stimulation. Our results show an overall increase in brain-wide CBV, CBF, and SO2, but regional differences in singular cortical veins and arteries and a reproducible anti-correlation pattern between venous and cortical hemodynamics, demonstrating the capabilities of the fUSPA system for providing multiparametric cerebrovascular information at high-resolution and sensitivity, that can bring insights into the complex mechanisms of neurodiseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast with ever growing popularity in the metabolic engineering circles. It is well known for its ability to accommodate a high carbon flux through acetyl-CoA and is being extensively studied for production of chemicals derived from it. We investigated the effects of modifying the upstream metabolism leading to acetyl-CoA on beta-carotene production, including its titer, yield, and content. We examined the pyruvate and the phosphoketolase bypass, both of which are stoichiometrically favorable for the production of acetyl-CoA and beta-carotene. Additionally, we examined a set of genes involved in the carnitine shuttle. We constructed a set of parental strains derived from the Y. lipolytica YB-392 wild-type strain, each with a different capacity for beta-carotene production, and introduced genes for the metabolic bypasses in each of the constructed parental strains. Subsequently, we subjected these constructed strains to a series of fermentation experiments. We discovered that altering the upstream metabolism in most cases led to a decrease in performance for production of beta-carotene. Most notably, a set of genes used for the pyruvate bypass (YlPDC2, YlALD5, and YlACS1) and the phosphoketolase bypass (LmXPK and CkPTA) resulted in the reduction of more than 30%. Our findings contribute to our understanding of Y. lipolytica&#39;s metabolic capacity and suggest that production of beta-carotene is most likely not limited solely by the acetyl-CoA supply. We also highlight a complex nature of engineering Y. lipolytica, as most of the results from studies using a different strain background did not align with our findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Peptide self-assembly into amyloid fibrils provides numerous applications in drug delivery and biomedical engineering applications. We augment our previously-established computational screening technique along with experimental biophysical characterization to discover 7-mer peptides that self-assemble into (parallel {beta}-sheets), i.e., {beta}-sheets with N-terminus-to-C-terminus {beta}-strand vectors oriented in parallel. To accomplish the desired {beta}-strand organization, we applied the PepAD amino acid sequence design software to the Class-1 cross-{beta} spine defined by Sawaya et al. This molecular configuration includes two layers of parallel {beta}-sheets stacked such that N-terminus-to-C-terminus vectors are oriented antiparallel for molecules on adjacent {beta}-sheets. The first cohort of PepAD identified peptides were examined for their fibrillation behavior in DMD/PRIME20 simulations, and the top performing sequence was selected as a prototype for a subsequent round of sequence refinement. The two rounds of design resulted in a library of eight 7-mer peptides. In DMD/PRIME20 simulations, five of these peptides spontaneously formed fibril-like structures with a predominantly parallel {beta}-sheet arrangement, two formed fibril-like structure with &lt;50% in parallel {beta}-sheet arrangement and one remained a random coil. Among the eight candidate peptides produced by PepAD and DMD/PRIME20, five were synthesized and purified. All five assembled into amyloid fibrils composed of parallel {beta}-sheets based on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism, Electron Microscopy, and Thioflavin-T fluorescence spectroscopy measurements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Conventional flexible implantable microelectrode arrays, used for real-time brain activity monitoring, incur minimal tissue damage due to their flexibility; however, these require retrieval surgery, causing trauma to subjects. Implants, fabricated using biodegradable materials, dissolve gradually in body fluid, eliminating the necessity for retrieval surgery. This work reports designing and developing a 10-channel flexible biodegradable microelectrode array to acquire electrocorticography signals from rats brains. The array was fabricated using tungsten, a transient metal, and PLLA:PCL (80:20), a biodegradable composite polymer. The subdural implantation of the array on the somatosensory cortex of rats (n=3) facilitated electrical biopotentials acquisition using OpenBCI Cyton Boards. The baseline activities, the induced epileptic discharges after peripheral electrical stimulation, and the recovered baseline activities after antiepileptic drug administration were recorded from sedated rats. The chronic baselines and evoked activities were also acquired from awake rats. The gradual decline of chronic baselines was evident, suggesting a possible dissolution of electrodes. Furthermore, the time-frequency analyses demonstrate the differences between baselines and induced epileptic activities. The signals recorded from microelectrode arrays demonstrate their potential to monitor brain activities in a chronic study. Histology of the harvested vital organs from the euthanized rats confirmed minimal tissue damage due to implantation.</p>
