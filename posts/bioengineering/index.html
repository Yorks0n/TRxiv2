O.\nScore: 31.3, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562069\nThe brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cells activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-re-solved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.\nProgrammable delivery of fluoxetine via wearable bioelectronics for wound healing in vivo\nAuthors: Li, H.; Yang, H.-y.; Asefifeyzabadi, N.; Baniya, P.; Zlobina, K.; Hsieh, H.-C.; Nguyen, T.; Hernandez, C.; Carrion, H.; Tebyani, M.; Selberg, J.; Gomez, M.; Teodorescu, M.; Lopez, A. M.; Gallegos, A.; Zhu, K.; Recendez, C.; Luo, L.; Alhamo, M. A.; Norouzi, N.; Soulika, A. M.; Levin, M.; Zhao, M.; Isseroff, R. R.; Rolandi, M.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561754\nThe ability to deliver drugs with precise dosages at specific time points can significantly improve disease treatment while reducing side effects. Drug encapsulation for gradual delivery has opened up the doors for superior treatment regimen. To expand on this ability, programming bioelectronic devices to deliver small molecules enables ad-hoc personalized therapeutic profiles that are more complex than simple gradual release. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic bandage with an integrated electrophoretic ion pump that affords on-demand drug delivery with precise dose control. Delivery of fluoxetine to wounds in mice resulted in a 27.2% decrease in the macrophage ratio (M1/M2) and a 39.9% increase in re-epithelialization, indicating a shorter inflammatory phase and faster overall healing. Programmable drug delivery using wearable bioelectronics in wounds introduces a broadly applicable strategy for the long-term delivery of a prescribed treatment regimen with minimal external intervention.\nBiodesign of Frugal CRISPR Kits for Equitable and Accessible Education\nAuthors: Collins, M. C.; Lau, M. B.; Ma, W.; Shen, A.; La Russa, M.; Qi, L. S.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562372\nEquitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.\nExtracellular matrix sulfation in the tumor microenvironment stimulates cancer stemness and invasiveness\nAuthors: Kusoglu, A.; Ornek, D.; Dansik, A.; Uzun, C.; Ozkan, S.

Proteoglycans (PG) are vital regulators of cellular signaling in the ECM with ability to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation via their sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) side chains. However, their role on tumor cell behavior is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that PGs are heavily expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients in correlation with invasive phenotype and poor prognosis. We developed a bioengineered human lung tumor model which recapitulates the increase of sGAGs in tumors in an organotypic matrix with independent control of stiffness, viscoelasticity, ligand density and porosity. Our model reveals that increased sulfation stimulates extensive proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in cancer cells. We identified the FAK-PI3K-mTOR signaling axis as a mediator of sulfation-induced molecular changes in cells upon activation of a distinct set of RTKs within tumor-mimetic hydrogels. We demonstrate that the transcriptomic landscape of tumor cells in response to increased sulfation resembles native PG-rich patient tumors through employing integrative omics and network modeling approaches.\nMolecular de-extinction of antibiotics enabled by deep learning\nAuthors: Wan, F.; Torres, M. D. T.; Peng, J.; de la Fuente, C.\nScore: 95.8, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560353\nMolecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the \"extinctome\") searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.\nLow-cost camera-based estrous tracking enables transgenesis in Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease\nAuthors: Buchthal, J.; Chory, E.

M.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563285\nCRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the production of animal models by reducing experimental timelines, slashing costs and streamlining gene editing, leading to a rapid expansion in the number of unique models for the study of human disease and gene function. However, most non-model animals, many of which are important in cancer and aging research, remain recalcitrant to genome engineering due to our limited understanding of their reproductive biology. Many wild rodents that transmit human diseases remain particularly challenging to engineer due to low pregnancy rates, the lack of external copulatory plugs, and susceptibility to premature termination of pregnancy. Here, we present low-cost activity-based estrous tracking for the efficient generation of timed pregnant and pseudopregnant white-footed mice and extend this tracking method to both lab mice and hamsters. Leveraging this technology, we demonstrate the generation of engineered Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease-causing bacteria and a putative model organism for studies of aging. These tools have broad implications for biomedical research and ecological engineering.\nLong-Term In Vivo Molecular Monitoring Using Aptamer-Graphene Microtransistors\nAuthors: Wu, G.; Zhang, E. T.; Qiang, Y.; Esmonde, C.; Chen, X.; Wei, Z.; Song, Y.; Zhang, X.; Schneider, M. J.; Li, H.; Sun, H.; Weng, Z.; Santaniello, S.; He, J.; Lai, R. Y.; Li, Y.; Bruchas, M. R.; Zhang, Y.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562080\nLong-term, real-time molecular monitoring in complex biological environments is critical for our ability to understand, prevent, diagnose, and manage human diseases. Aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors possess the promise due to their generalizability and a high degree of selectivity. Nevertheless, the operation of existing aptamer-based biosensors in vivo is limited to a few hours. Here, we report a first-generation long-term in vivo molecular monitoring platform, named aptamer-graphene microtransistors (AGMs). The AGM incorporates a layer of pyrene- (polyethylene glycol)5-alcohol and DNase inhibitor-doped polyacrylamide hydrogel coating to reduce biofouling and aptamer degradation. As a demonstration of function and generalizability, the AGM achieves the detection of biomolecules such as dopamine and serotonin in undiluted whole blood at 37 {degrees}C for 11 days. Furthermore, the AGM successfully captures optically evoked dopamine release in vivo in mice for over one week and demonstrates the capability to monitor behaviorally-induced endogenous dopamine release even after eight days of implantation in freely moving mice. The results reported in this work establish the potential for chronic aptamer-based molecular monitoring platforms, and thus serve as a new benchmark for molecular monitoring using aptamer-based technology.\nPhotoacoustic Imaging for Non-Invasive Assessment of Physiological Biomarkers of Intestinal Injury in Experimental Necrotizing Enterocolitis\nAuthors: Weis, J. A.; Rauh, J. L.; Ellison, M. A.; Cruz-Diaz, N.; Yamaleyeva, L. M.; Welch, C. D.; Zeller, K. A.; Weis, V. G.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563296\nBackground: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often-lethal disease of the premature infants' intestinal tract that is exacerbated by significant difficulties in early and accurate diagnosis. In NEC disease, the intestine often exhibits hypoperfusion and dysmotility, which contributes to advanced disease pathogenesis. However, these physiological features cannot be accurately and quantitively assessed within the current constraints of imaging modalities frequently used in the clinic (plain film X-ray and ultrasound). We have previously demonstrated the ability of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to non-invasively and quantitively assess intestinal tissue oxygenation and motility in a healthy neonatal rat model. As a first-in-disease application, we evaluated NEC pathogenesis using PAI to assess intestinal health biomarkers in a preclinical neonatal rat experimental model of NEC. Methods: NEC was induced in neonatal rat pups from birth to 4 days old via hypertonic formula feeding, full-body hypoxic stress, and lipopolysaccharide administration to mimic bacterial colonization. Healthy breastfed (BF) controls and NEC rat pups were imaged at 2- and 4-days old. Intestinal tissue oxygen saturation was measured with PAI imaging for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin levels. To measure intestinal motility, ultrasound and co-registered PAI cine recordings were used to capture intestinal peristalsis motion and contrast agent (indocyanine green) transit within the intestinal lumen. Additionally, both midplane two-dimensional and volumetric three-dimensional imaging acquisitions were assessed for oxygenation and motility. Results: NEC pups showed a significant decrease of intestinal tissue oxygenation as compared to healthy BF controls at both ages (2-days old: 55.90% +/- 3.77% vs 44.12% +/- 7.18%; 4-days old: 56.13% +/- 3.52% vs 38.86% +/- 8.33%). Intestinal motility, assessed using a computational intestinal deformation analysis, demonstrated a significant reduction in the intestinal motility index in both early (2-day) and established (4-day) NEC. Extensive NEC damage was confirmed with histology and dysmotility was confirmed by small intestinal transit assay. Conclusions: This study presents PAI as a successful emerging diagnostic imaging modality for both intestinal tissue oxygenation and intestinal motility disease hallmarks in a rat NEC model. PAI presents enormous significance and potential for fundamentally changing current clinical paradigms for detecting and monitoring intestinal pathologies in the premature infant.\nDeep learning-based aberration compensation improves contrast and resolution in fluorescence microscopy\nAuthors: Guo, M.; Wu, Y.; Su, Y.; Qian, S.; Krueger, E.; Christensen, R.; Kroeschell, G.; Bui, J.; Chaw, M.; Zhang, L.; Liu, J.; Hou, X.; Han, X.; Ma, X.; Zhovmer, A.; Combs, C.; Moyle, M.; Yemini, E.; Liu, H.; Liu, Z.; La Riviere, P.; Colon-Ramos, D.; Shroff, H.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562439\nOptical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics into the imaging path. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations to show that applying the trained de-aberration networks outperforms alternative methods, and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos.\nMatrix architecture and mechanics regulate myofibril organization, costamere assembly, and contractility of engineered myocardial microtissues\nAuthors: DePalma, S. J.; Jillberto, J.; Stis, A. E.; Huang, D. D.; Lo, J.; Davidson, C. D.; Chowdhury, A.; Jewett, M. E.; Kobeissi, H.; Chen, C. S.; Lejeune, E.; Helms, A. S.; Nordsletten, D. A.; Baker, B.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563346\nThe mechanical function of the myocardium is defined by cardiomyocyte contractility and the biomechanics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding this relationship remains an important unmet challenge due to limitations in existing approaches for engineering myocardial tissue. Here, we established arrays of cardiac microtissues with tunable mechanics and architecture by integrating ECM-mimetic synthetic, fiber matrices and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), enabling real-time contractility readouts, in-depth structural assessment, and tissue-specific computational modeling. We find that the stiffness and alignment of matrix fibers distinctly affect the structural development and contractile function of pure iPSC-CM tissues. Further examination into the impact of fibrous matrix stiffness enabled by computational models and quantitative immunofluorescence implicates cell-ECM interactions in myofibril assembly and notably costamere assembly, which correlates with improved contractile function of tissues. These results highlight how iPSC-CM tissue models with controllable architecture and mechanics can inform the design of translatable regenerative cardiac therapies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The brain is comprised of multiple regions performing distinct functions. Within each of these regions, there are multiple cell types that can affect brain physiology. Finally, within each cell there are multiple signaling pathways, that, when activated or inhibited, control the cells activity, and consequently the brain function. For these reasons, methods that can control the brain with regional, cell-type, and molecular precision have been widely used in neuroscience. However, so far, achieving sustained control over a brain region with that level of specificity relied either on gene delivery or placement of invasive devices. While gene therapy holds great promise, the risks of genomic integration, vector toxicity, vector-directed immune response, high cost, and gene delivery to the brain pose significant challenges. On the other hand, invasive devices enable site-specific delivery of drugs but can also surgically damage the modulated brain region, carrying risks of infection and hemorrhage. Here, we present a new approach that can provide multi-day, noninvasive, site-specific control over specific cell types in the brain without the need to use invasive devices or gene delivery. To achieve this, we introduce a new paradigm called Regionally Activated Interstitial Drugs, or RAID, which delivers a protein-based catalytic centers, or RAID enzymes, to the brain using focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening. This catalytic center is designed to attach to the interstitial space in the brain where it remains for days after initial delivery. While the catalytic center is present in the brain, it can locally process an inert BBB permeable prodrug into an active drug, resulting in localized therapy. Our proof-of concept studies demonstrated that the engineered RAID enzymes can retain activity in the brain parenchyma for several days, allowing for noninvasive site-specific induction of neuronal activity that was sufficiently potent to elicit behavioral effects. Overall, the RAID paradigm enabled noninvasive, tunable, temporally-re-solved, site-specific, non-genetic, neuromodulation over multiple days. The RAID paradigm is versatile and can be applied to any enzyme and prodrug pair to control various aspects of central nervous system physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to deliver drugs with precise dosages at specific time points can significantly improve disease treatment while reducing side effects. Drug encapsulation for gradual delivery has opened up the doors for superior treatment regimen. To expand on this ability, programming bioelectronic devices to deliver small molecules enables ad-hoc personalized therapeutic profiles that are more complex than simple gradual release. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic bandage with an integrated electrophoretic ion pump that affords on-demand drug delivery with precise dose control. Delivery of fluoxetine to wounds in mice resulted in a 27.2% decrease in the macrophage ratio (M1/M2) and a 39.9% increase in re-epithelialization, indicating a shorter inflammatory phase and faster overall healing. Programmable drug delivery using wearable bioelectronics in wounds introduces a broadly applicable strategy for the long-term delivery of a prescribed treatment regimen with minimal external intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Equitable and accessible education on life sciences and bioengineering is crucial to training the next generation of scientists, fostering transparency in public decision-making, and ensuring biotechnology democratization that can benefit a wide-ranging population. As a ground-breaking technology for genome engineering, CRISPR has transformed research and therapeutics. However, hands-on exposure to this technology for educational purposes remains restricted, primarily due to extensive resources required to execute CRISPR experiments. In this study, we develop an accessible and frugal CRISPR kit, tailored for K-12 education settings. Our CRISPR kit eliminates the need for equipment, prioritizes biosafety, and utilizes cost-effective reagents. By combining CRISPRi gene regulation, chromoproteins, cell-free transcription-translation systems, and smartphone-based quantification, our kit offers a user-friendly approach and a reliable assessment of CRISPR activity, eliminating the need for a traditional laboratory setup. Experiments conducted by high school students in real-world settings highlight the kits utility for conducting reliable CRISPR experiments. The frugal CRISPR kit provides a modular and expandable platform to offer students hands-on experience in genome engineering, and we envision that it will facilitate equitable and accessible education and technology democratization for communities of diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor extracellular matrices (ECM) exhibit aberrant changes in composition and mechanics compared to normal tissues. Proteoglycans (PG) are vital regulators of cellular signaling in the ECM with ability to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation via their sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) side chains. However, their role on tumor cell behavior is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that PGs are heavily expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients in correlation with invasive phenotype and poor prognosis. We developed a bioengineered human lung tumor model which recapitulates the increase of sGAGs in tumors in an organotypic matrix with independent control of stiffness, viscoelasticity, ligand density and porosity. Our model reveals that increased sulfation stimulates extensive proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in cancer cells. We identified the FAK-PI3K-mTOR signaling axis as a mediator of sulfation-induced molecular changes in cells upon activation of a distinct set of RTKs within tumor-mimetic hydrogels. We demonstrate that the transcriptomic landscape of tumor cells in response to increased sulfation resembles native PG-rich patient tumors through employing integrative omics and network modeling approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular de-extinction is an emerging field that aims to resurrect molecules to solve present-day problems such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the &#34;extinctome&#34;) searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models. We propose molecular de-extinction, accelerated by deep learning, as a framework for discovering therapeutic molecules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the production of animal models by reducing experimental timelines, slashing costs and streamlining gene editing, leading to a rapid expansion in the number of unique models for the study of human disease and gene function. However, most non-model animals, many of which are important in cancer and aging research, remain recalcitrant to genome engineering due to our limited understanding of their reproductive biology. Many wild rodents that transmit human diseases remain particularly challenging to engineer due to low pregnancy rates, the lack of external copulatory plugs, and susceptibility to premature termination of pregnancy. Here, we present low-cost activity-based estrous tracking for the efficient generation of timed pregnant and pseudopregnant white-footed mice and extend this tracking method to both lab mice and hamsters. Leveraging this technology, we demonstrate the generation of engineered Peromyscus leucopus, the primary reservoir for Lyme disease-causing bacteria and a putative model organism for studies of aging. These tools have broad implications for biomedical research and ecological engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long-term, real-time molecular monitoring in complex biological environments is critical for our ability to understand, prevent, diagnose, and manage human diseases. Aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors possess the promise due to their generalizability and a high degree of selectivity. Nevertheless, the operation of existing aptamer-based biosensors in vivo is limited to a few hours. Here, we report a first-generation long-term in vivo molecular monitoring platform, named aptamer-graphene microtransistors (AGMs). The AGM incorporates a layer of pyrene- (polyethylene glycol)5-alcohol and DNase inhibitor-doped polyacrylamide hydrogel coating to reduce biofouling and aptamer degradation. As a demonstration of function and generalizability, the AGM achieves the detection of biomolecules such as dopamine and serotonin in undiluted whole blood at 37 {degrees}C for 11 days. Furthermore, the AGM successfully captures optically evoked dopamine release in vivo in mice for over one week and demonstrates the capability to monitor behaviorally-induced endogenous dopamine release even after eight days of implantation in freely moving mice. The results reported in this work establish the potential for chronic aptamer-based molecular monitoring platforms, and thus serve as a new benchmark for molecular monitoring using aptamer-based technology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often-lethal disease of the premature infants&#39; intestinal tract that is exacerbated by significant difficulties in early and accurate diagnosis. In NEC disease, the intestine often exhibits hypoperfusion and dysmotility, which contributes to advanced disease pathogenesis. However, these physiological features cannot be accurately and quantitively assessed within the current constraints of imaging modalities frequently used in the clinic (plain film X-ray and ultrasound). We have previously demonstrated the ability of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to non-invasively and quantitively assess intestinal tissue oxygenation and motility in a healthy neonatal rat model. As a first-in-disease application, we evaluated NEC pathogenesis using PAI to assess intestinal health biomarkers in a preclinical neonatal rat experimental model of NEC. Methods: NEC was induced in neonatal rat pups from birth to 4 days old via hypertonic formula feeding, full-body hypoxic stress, and lipopolysaccharide administration to mimic bacterial colonization. Healthy breastfed (BF) controls and NEC rat pups were imaged at 2- and 4-days old. Intestinal tissue oxygen saturation was measured with PAI imaging for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin levels. To measure intestinal motility, ultrasound and co-registered PAI cine recordings were used to capture intestinal peristalsis motion and contrast agent (indocyanine green) transit within the intestinal lumen. Additionally, both midplane two-dimensional and volumetric three-dimensional imaging acquisitions were assessed for oxygenation and motility. Results: NEC pups showed a significant decrease of intestinal tissue oxygenation as compared to healthy BF controls at both ages (2-days old: 55.90% &#43;/- 3.77% vs 44.12% &#43;/- 7.18%; 4-days old: 56.13% &#43;/- 3.52% vs 38.86% &#43;/- 8.33%). Intestinal motility, assessed using a computational intestinal deformation analysis, demonstrated a significant reduction in the intestinal motility index in both early (2-day) and established (4-day) NEC. Extensive NEC damage was confirmed with histology and dysmotility was confirmed by small intestinal transit assay. Conclusions: This study presents PAI as a successful emerging diagnostic imaging modality for both intestinal tissue oxygenation and intestinal motility disease hallmarks in a rat NEC model. PAI presents enormous significance and potential for fundamentally changing current clinical paradigms for detecting and monitoring intestinal pathologies in the premature infant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Optical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics into the imaging path. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations to show that applying the trained  de-aberration networks outperforms alternative methods, and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanical function of the myocardium is defined by cardiomyocyte contractility and the biomechanics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding this relationship remains an important unmet challenge due to limitations in existing approaches for engineering myocardial tissue. Here, we established arrays of cardiac microtissues with tunable mechanics and architecture by integrating ECM-mimetic synthetic, fiber matrices and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), enabling real-time contractility readouts, in-depth structural assessment, and tissue-specific computational modeling. We find that the stiffness and alignment of matrix fibers distinctly affect the structural development and contractile function of pure iPSC-CM tissues. Further examination into the impact of fibrous matrix stiffness enabled by computational models and quantitative immunofluorescence implicates cell-ECM interactions in myofibril assembly and notably costamere assembly, which correlates with improved contractile function of tissues. These results highlight how iPSC-CM tissue models with controllable architecture and mechanics can inform the design of translatable regenerative cardiac therapies.</p>
