J.; Hemberg, M.; Noseda, M.; Bayraktar, O. A.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572494\nThe most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.\nCognitive and molecular characterization of the Ts66Yah murine model of Down syndrome: deepening on hippocampal changes associated with genotype and aging.\nAuthors: Lanzillotta, C.; Rataj-Baniowska, M.; Prestia, F.; Sette, C.; Nalesso, V.; Perluigi, M.; Barone, E.; Duchon, A.; Tramutola, A.; Herault, Y.; Di Domenico, F.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573811\nDown syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.\nDeletion of absent in melanoma (AIM) 2 gene alters bone morphology\nAuthors: Gong, Z.; Dixit, M.; Poudel, S. B.; Yildirim, G.; Yakar, S.; Muzumdar, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574199\nAbsent in Melanoma (AIM) 2 is a gene that is induced by interferon and acts as a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded (ds) DNA. It forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18. Our previous research demonstrated that mice lacking AIM2 exhibit spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of AIM2 gene deletion on bone structure in adult and aged mice. Utilizing micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), we discovered that female mice lacking AIM2 showed an increase in the total cross-sectional area at 5 months of age, accompanied by an increase in cortical thickness in the mid-diaphysis of the femur at both 5 and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, the cortical bone mineral density (BMD) significantly decreased in AIM2 null females compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In AIM2 null mice, both trabecular bone volume and BMD at the distal metaphysis of the femur significantly decreased at 5 and 15 months of age. Similarly, micro-CT analysis of the L4 vertebra revealed significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and BMD in aged AIM2 null females compared to WT mice. Histological examination of femurs from aged mice demonstrated increased bone marrow adiposity in AIM2 null mice, accompanied by a significant increase in CD45-/CD31-/Sca1+/Pdgfa+ adipose progenitor cells, and a decrease in the ratio of CD31-/CD31+ osteogenic progenitor cells, as determined by flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Our findings suggest that AIM2 deficiency affects bone health by promoting adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and inducing a pro-inflammatory environment, potentially contributing to the decreased bone mineral density.\nAlzheimer's disease copathology in dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with astroglial α-synucleinopathy\nAuthors: Geut, H.; van den Berg, E.; Boon, B. D.; Hoozemans, J. J.; Tunold, J.-A.; Pihlstrom, L.; Jonkman, L. E.; Rozemuller, A. J.; Lemstra, E. A.; van de Berg, W. D. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573857\nBackgroundIn dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), co-existence of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, i.e. amyloid-{beta} plaques and tau tangles, has been associated with a more rapid disease progression. In post-mortem DLB brains, we examined the association between AD copathology and regional load and morphology of -synuclein pathology. Also, we compared regional load and morphology of AD copathology in DLB to pathology in AD. MethodsWe included 50 autopsy-confirmed DLB donors with a clinical DLB phenotype, categorized as having no/low levels of AD copathology (pure DLB, n = 15), or intermediate/high levels of AD copathology (mixed DLB+AD, n = 35), and autopsy-confirmed pure AD donors (n = 14) without - synuclein pathology. We used percentage area of immunopositivity for quantitative assessment of pathology load, and visual scores for semi-quantitative assessment of different morphologies of - synuclein, amyloid-{beta} and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology in fifteen neocortical, limbic and brainstem regions. ResultsMixed DLB+AD compared to pure DLB showed a shorter disease duration (6 {+/-} 3 versus 8 {+/-} 3 years, p = 0.021) and higher frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles. A-synuclein load was higher in neocortical regions (temporal, parietal and occipital), but not in brainstem and limbic regions, which was based upon an increase of Lewy bodies, -synuclein-positive astrocytes and -synuclein-positive plaques in these regions. A-synuclein load was most strongly correlated to amyloid-{beta} and p-tau load in temporal (r = 0.38 and r = 0.50 respectively) and occipital regions (r = 0.43 and r = 0.42 respectively). Compared to pure AD, mixed DLB+AD showed a lower amyloid-{beta} load in temporal cortex, CA3 and CA4 region, and lower p-tau loads in frontal and parietal cortex, based both upon presence of fewer neuritic plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. ConclusionsIn DLB brains, AD copathology was associated with more neocortical -synuclein pathology, consisting not only of Lewy bodies and plaques, but also of astroglial -synuclein. AD pathology in DLB cases is less than in AD cases, reflecting less advanced pathological stages. Astroglial -synuclein and its relation with AD copathology in DLB should be further studied, as this may play a role in accelerating clinical decline.\nInhibiting YAP1 reduced abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by suppressing adventitial fibroblast phenotype transformation and migration\nAuthors: Xie, C.; Hu, Y.; Yin, Z.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573973\nBACKGROUNDThe adventitial fibroblast (AF) is the most abundant cell in the vascular adventitia, a few studies had confirmed that AF contributed to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development; YAP1 involved in several vascular diseases by promoting AF transformed to myofibroblast, the role of YAP1 in AAA is not clear yet. This study aims to determine whether YAP1 play a role in AAA process by regulating AF function. METHODSElastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model were used in this study, we applied YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in vivo to explore the role of YAP1 in AAA information; in vitro, Verteporfin and YAP1-siRNA were used to intervened TGF-{beta}1 induced fibroblasts phenotype transformation and migration model. RESULTSAt first, we use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) to compare the expression of YAP1 in aneurysm tissues of AAA patients with normal adjacent vascular tissues, we found that the expression of YAP1 in AAA tissues was significantly increased, and YAP1 mainly increased in adventitia. YAP1 also upregulated in elastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model. Then, we diminished YAP1 function with YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in above mice AAA model, AAA incident rate was remarkably declined, and the collagen deposition in the adventitia was alleviated obviously. Afterwards, we studied the effect of YAP1 on the function of AF, we found that the process of AF transforming to myofibroblast and migration were almost completely eliminated after inhibiting YAP1 expression. CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrated that YAP1 may play a key role in AAA development, inhibiting YAP1 significantly reduced AAA formation through suppressed the process of AF transformed to myofibroblast and migration.\nA weighted and cumulative point system for accurate scoring of intestinal pathology in a piglet model of necrotizing enterocolitis\nAuthors: Offersen, S. M.; Henriksen, N. L.; Brunse, A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574327\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition, primarily affecting premature infants, in which a portion of the gut undergoes inflammation and necrosis. Symptoms of NEC are unspecific, and together with a rapid progression, the disease remains a significant concern. The preterm pig develops NEC spontaneously, making it a suitable model for exploring novel treatments. During piglet necropsy, NEC-lesions closely resemble the pathologies found during surgery or autopsy of preterm infants. As such, the systematic gross inspection enables direct evaluation of gut lesions, which is not possible in the medical preterm patient. Here, we introduce a revised intestinal scoring system with an expanded score range and more detailed descriptive features to accurately describe the diversity of NEC-lesions in the preterm piglet model. We included 333 preterm piglets from four separate experiments, each delivered via cesarian section at 90% gestation. The pigs were fed either a gently processed (GP) or harshly processed (HP) milk formula for 96 hours and were subsequently euthanized. At necropsy, the gastrointestinal tract was assessed with 1) an established 6-grade scoring system and 2) a systematic and descriptive approach focusing on the distribution and severity of hyperemia, hemorrhage, pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas), and necrosis. Lesion biopsies were sampled for cytokine measurement and a subset (n = 62) was sampled for histopathological assessment. The systematic and descriptive registrations were evaluated and converted into a weighted and cumulative point (WCP) score. Compared to the 6-grade score, the WCP score enabled a higher discrepancy in severity levels, especially among organs with more prominent NEC lesions. IL-1{beta} in small intestinal lesions and both IL-8 and IL-1{beta} in colon lesions correlated positively with the WCP scale. A histopathological grade system (0-8) was established and revealed mucosal lesions not recognized macroscopically. Finally, the WCP score showed a higher NEC-promoting effect of the HP formula compared to the GP formula. In conclusion, the validation of the weighted and cumulative scoring system demonstrated an expanded score range, enhancing the accuracy in describing NEC-lesions in gastrointestinal segments of preterm pigs. This approach may increase the efficiency of preclinical NEC experiments.\nHow are APOE4, changes in body weight, and longevity related? Insights from a causal mediation analysis\nAuthors: Holmes, R.; Duan, H.; Bagley, O.; Wu, D.; Loika, Y.; Kulminski, A.; Yashin, A.; Arbeev, K.; Ukraintseva, S.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300485\nThe {varepsilon}4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is known for its negative association with human longevity, however, the mechanism is unclear. APOE4 was also linked to changes in body weight, and the latter changes were associated with survival in some studies. Here we explore the role of aging changes in weight in the connection between APOE4 and longevity, using a Causal Mediation Analysis (CMA) approach to uncovering mechanisms of genetic associations. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data, we tested a hypothesis, whether the association of APOE4 with reduced survival to age 85+ is mediated by key characteristics of age-trajectories of weight, such as age at reaching peak values, and slope of the decline in weight afterwards. Mediation effects were evaluated by the Total Effect (TE), Natural Indirect Effect, and Proportion Mediated. Controlled Direct Effect and Natural Direct Effect are also reported. The CMA results suggest that APOE4 carriers have 19%-22% (TE p=0.019-0.038) lower chances of surviving to age 85 and beyond in part because they reach peak values of weight at younger ages, and their weight declines faster afterwards, compared to non-carriers. This finding is in line with the idea that detrimental effect of APOE4 on longevity is in part related to accelerated physical aging of {varepsilon}4 carriers.\nNeuropathological assessment of the olfactory bulb and tract in individuals with COVID-19\nAuthors: Lengacher, N. A.; Tomlinson, J. J.; Jochum, A.-K.; Franz, J.; Hasan Ali, O.; Flatz, L.; Jochum, W.; Penninger, J.; aSCENT-PD Investigators, ; Stadelmann-Nessler, C.; Woulfe, J. M.; Schlossmacher, M. G.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572180\nThe majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19+ patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19+ patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19+ patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Down syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Absent in Melanoma (AIM) 2 is a gene that is induced by interferon and acts as a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded (ds) DNA. It forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18. Our previous research demonstrated that mice lacking AIM2 exhibit spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of AIM2 gene deletion on bone structure in adult and aged mice. Utilizing micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), we discovered that female mice lacking AIM2 showed an increase in the total cross-sectional area at 5 months of age, accompanied by an increase in cortical thickness in the mid-diaphysis of the femur at both 5 and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, the cortical bone mineral density (BMD) significantly decreased in AIM2 null females compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In AIM2 null mice, both trabecular bone volume and BMD at the distal metaphysis of the femur significantly decreased at 5 and 15 months of age. Similarly, micro-CT analysis of the L4 vertebra revealed significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and BMD in aged AIM2 null females compared to WT mice. Histological examination of femurs from aged mice demonstrated increased bone marrow adiposity in AIM2 null mice, accompanied by a significant increase in CD45-/CD31-/Sca1&#43;/Pdgfa&#43; adipose progenitor cells, and a decrease in the ratio of CD31-/CD31&#43; osteogenic progenitor cells, as determined by flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Our findings suggest that AIM2 deficiency affects bone health by promoting adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and inducing a pro-inflammatory environment, potentially contributing to the decreased bone mineral density.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), co-existence of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, i.e. amyloid-{beta} plaques and tau tangles, has been associated with a more rapid disease progression. In post-mortem DLB brains, we examined the association between AD copathology and regional load and morphology of -synuclein pathology. Also, we compared regional load and morphology of AD copathology in DLB to pathology in AD.

MethodsWe included 50 autopsy-confirmed DLB donors with a clinical DLB phenotype, categorized as having no/low levels of AD copathology (pure DLB, n = 15), or intermediate/high levels of AD copathology (mixed DLB&#43;AD, n = 35), and autopsy-confirmed pure AD donors (n = 14) without - synuclein pathology. We used percentage area of immunopositivity for quantitative assessment of pathology load, and visual scores for semi-quantitative assessment of different morphologies of - synuclein, amyloid-{beta} and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology in fifteen neocortical, limbic and brainstem regions.

ResultsMixed DLB&#43;AD compared to pure DLB showed a shorter disease duration (6 {&#43;/-} 3 versus 8 {&#43;/-} 3 years, p = 0.021) and higher frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles. A-synuclein load was higher in neocortical regions (temporal, parietal and occipital), but not in brainstem and limbic regions, which was based upon an increase of Lewy bodies, -synuclein-positive astrocytes and -synuclein-positive plaques in these regions. A-synuclein load was most strongly correlated to amyloid-{beta} and p-tau load in temporal (r = 0.38 and r = 0.50 respectively) and occipital regions (r = 0.43 and r = 0.42 respectively). Compared to pure AD, mixed DLB&#43;AD showed a lower amyloid-{beta} load in temporal cortex, CA3 and CA4 region, and lower p-tau loads in frontal and parietal cortex, based both upon presence of fewer neuritic plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles.

ConclusionsIn DLB brains, AD copathology was associated with more neocortical -synuclein pathology, consisting not only of Lewy bodies and plaques, but also of astroglial -synuclein. AD pathology in DLB cases is less than in AD cases, reflecting less advanced pathological stages. Astroglial -synuclein and its relation with AD copathology in DLB should be further studied, as this may play a role in accelerating clinical decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDThe adventitial fibroblast (AF) is the most abundant cell in the vascular adventitia, a few studies had confirmed that AF contributed to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development; YAP1 involved in several vascular diseases by promoting AF transformed to myofibroblast, the role of YAP1 in AAA is not clear yet. This study aims to determine whether YAP1 play a role in AAA process by regulating AF function.

METHODSElastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model were used in this study, we applied YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in vivo to explore the role of YAP1 in AAA information; in vitro, Verteporfin and YAP1-siRNA were used to intervened TGF-{beta}1 induced fibroblasts phenotype transformation and migration model.

RESULTSAt first, we use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) to compare the expression of YAP1 in aneurysm tissues of AAA patients with normal adjacent vascular tissues, we found that the expression of YAP1 in AAA tissues was significantly increased, and YAP1 mainly increased in adventitia. YAP1 also upregulated in elastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model. Then, we diminished YAP1 function with YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in above mice AAA model, AAA incident rate was remarkably declined, and the collagen deposition in the adventitia was alleviated obviously. Afterwards, we studied the effect of YAP1 on the function of AF, we found that the process of AF transforming to myofibroblast and migration were almost completely eliminated after inhibiting YAP1 expression.

CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrated that YAP1 may play a key role in AAA development, inhibiting YAP1 significantly reduced AAA formation through suppressed the process of AF transformed to myofibroblast and migration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition, primarily affecting premature infants, in which a portion of the gut undergoes inflammation and necrosis. Symptoms of NEC are unspecific, and together with a rapid progression, the disease remains a significant concern. The preterm pig develops NEC spontaneously, making it a suitable model for exploring novel treatments. During piglet necropsy, NEC-lesions closely resemble the pathologies found during surgery or autopsy of preterm infants. As such, the systematic gross inspection enables direct evaluation of gut lesions, which is not possible in the medical preterm patient. Here, we introduce a revised intestinal scoring system with an expanded score range and more detailed descriptive features to accurately describe the diversity of NEC-lesions in the preterm piglet model. We included 333 preterm piglets from four separate experiments, each delivered via cesarian section at 90% gestation. The pigs were fed either a gently processed (GP) or harshly processed (HP) milk formula for 96 hours and were subsequently euthanized. At necropsy, the gastrointestinal tract was assessed with 1) an established 6-grade scoring system and 2) a systematic and descriptive approach focusing on the distribution and severity of hyperemia, hemorrhage, pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas), and necrosis. Lesion biopsies were sampled for cytokine measurement and a subset (n = 62) was sampled for histopathological assessment. The systematic and descriptive registrations were evaluated and converted into a weighted and cumulative point (WCP) score. Compared to the 6-grade score, the WCP score enabled a higher discrepancy in severity levels, especially among organs with more prominent NEC lesions. IL-1{beta} in small intestinal lesions and both IL-8 and IL-1{beta} in colon lesions correlated positively with the WCP scale. A histopathological grade system (0-8) was established and revealed mucosal lesions not recognized macroscopically. Finally, the WCP score showed a higher NEC-promoting effect of the HP formula compared to the GP formula. In conclusion, the validation of the weighted and cumulative scoring system demonstrated an expanded score range, enhancing the accuracy in describing NEC-lesions in gastrointestinal segments of preterm pigs. This approach may increase the efficiency of preclinical NEC experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The {varepsilon}4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is known for its negative association with human longevity, however, the mechanism is unclear. APOE4 was also linked to changes in body weight, and the latter changes were associated with survival in some studies. Here we explore the role of aging changes in weight in the connection between APOE4 and longevity, using a Causal Mediation Analysis (CMA) approach to uncovering mechanisms of genetic associations. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data, we tested a hypothesis, whether the association of APOE4 with reduced survival to age 85&#43; is mediated by key characteristics of age-trajectories of weight, such as age at reaching peak values, and slope of the decline in weight afterwards. Mediation effects were evaluated by the Total Effect (TE), Natural Indirect Effect, and Proportion Mediated. Controlled Direct Effect and Natural Direct Effect are also reported. The CMA results suggest that APOE4 carriers have 19%-22% (TE p=0.019-0.038) lower chances of surviving to age 85 and beyond in part because they reach peak values of weight at younger ages, and their weight declines faster afterwards, compared to non-carriers. This finding is in line with the idea that detrimental effect of APOE4 on longevity is in part related to accelerated physical aging of {varepsilon}4 carriers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19&#43; patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19&#43; patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19&#43; patients.</p>
