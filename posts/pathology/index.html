It offers unprecedented opportunities for improved efficiency in treatment decisions by allowing pathologists to achieve higher precision and objectivity in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First, we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in the literature. This paves the way for the development of a foundation model for histopathology.\nGlycoprotein VI is Critical for the Detection and Progression of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\nAuthors: Benson, T. W.; Pike, M. M.; Spuzzillo, A.; Hicks, S. M.; Pham, M.; Mix, D. S.; Brunner, S. I.; Wadding-Lee, C. A.; Conrad, K. A.; Russell, H. M.; Jennings, C.; Coughlin, T. M.; Aggarwal, A.; Lyden, S.; Mani, K.; Bjorck, M.; Wanhainen, A.; Bhandari, R.; Lipworth, L.; Robinson-Cohen, C.; Caputo, F. J.; Shim, S.; Edwards, T. L.; Tranter, M.; Gardiner, E. E.; Mackman, N.; Cameron, S. J.; Owens, A. P.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547361\nA common feature in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is the formation of a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in regions of aortic dilation. Platelets are known to maintain hemostasis and propagate thrombosis through several redundant activation mechanisms, yet the role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of AAA associated ILT is still poorly understood. Thus, we sought to investigate how platelet activation impacts the pathogenesis of AAA. Using RNA-sequencing, we identify that the platelet-associated transcripts are significantly enriched in the ILT compared to the adjacent aneurysm wall and healthy control aortas. We found that the platelet specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is among the top enriched genes in AAA ILT and is increased on the platelet surface of AAA patients. Examination of a specific indicator of platelet activity, soluble GPVI (sGPVI), in two independent AAA patient cohorts is highly predictive of a AAA diagnosis and associates more strongly with aneurysm growth rate when compared to D-dimer in humans. Finally, intervention with the anti-GPVI antibody (J) in mice with established aneurysms blunted the progression of AAA in two independent mouse models. In conclusion, we show that levels of sGPVI in humans can predict a diagnosis of AAA and AAA growth rate, which may be critical in the identification of high-risk patients. We also identify GPVI as a novel platelet-specific AAA therapeutic target, with minimal risk of adverse bleeding complications, where none currently exist. KEY POINTSO_LISoluble glycoprotein VI, which is a platelet-derived blood biomarker, predicts a diagnosis of AAA, with high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients with fast from slow-growing AAA. C_LIO_LIBlockade of glycoprotein VI in mice with established aneurysms reduces AAA progression and mortality, indicating therapeutic potential.

N.; Field, E.; Tollit, J.; Heenan, I. K.; Barnes, A.; Taylor, M. R.; Mestroni, L.; Kaski, J. P.; Saffitz, J. E.; Asimaki, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550526\nSTRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSWe sought to determine if persistent innate immune signaling via NF{kappa}B occurs in cardiac myocytes in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and if this is associated with myocardial infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells expressing CCR2. We also determined if buccal mucosa cells from young subjects with inherited disease alleles exhibit NF{kappa}B signaling. BackgroundNF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes disease in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing CCR2-expressing macrophages which promote myocardial injury and arrhythmias. Buccal mucosa cells exhibit pathologic features similar to those seen in cardiac myocytes in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. MethodsWe analyzed myocardium from arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We also analyzed buccal mucosa cells from young subjects with inherited disease alleles. The presence of immunoreactive signal for RelA/p65 in nuclei of cardiac myocytes and buccal cells was used as a reliable indicator of active NF{kappa}B signaling. We also counted myocardial CCR2-expressing cells. ResultsNF{kappa}B signaling was seen in cardiac myocytes in 34 of 36 cases of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy but in none of 19 age-matched controls. Cells expressing CCR2 were increased in patient hearts in numbers directly correlated with the number of cardiac myocytes showing NF{kappa}B signaling. NF{kappa}B signaling also occurred in buccal cells in young subjects with active disease. ConclusionsPatients with clinically active arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy exhibit persistent innate immune responses in cardiac myocytes and buccal mucosa cells reflecting an inflammatory process that fails to resolve. Such individuals may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy. CONDENSED ABSTRACTNF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes arrhythmias and myocardial injury in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing pro-inflammatory CCR2-expressing macrophages to the heart. Based on these new mechanistic insights, we analyzed hearts of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We observed active NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes associated with marked infiltration of CCR2-expressing cells. We also observed NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells obtained from young subjects with active disease. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy may be effective in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Screening buccal cells may be a reliable way to identify patients most likely to benefit. HIGHLIGHTS- Inflammation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy but the responsible mechanisms and the roles of specific classes of immune cells remain undefined. - NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes is sufficient to cause disease in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing injurious myeloid cells expressing CCR2 to the heart. - Here, we provide evidence of persistent NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes and increased CCR2-expressing cells in hearts of patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. We observed a close correlation between the number of cardiac myocytes with active NF{kappa}B signaling and the number of CCR2-expressing cells in patient hearts. - We also provide evidence of active NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells associated with initial onset of disease and/or disease progression in young subjects with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy alleles.\n",

We found that the platelet specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is among the top enriched genes in AAA ILT and is increased on the platelet surface of AAA patients. Examination of a specific indicator of platelet activity, soluble GPVI (sGPVI), in two independent AAA patient cohorts is highly predictive of a AAA diagnosis and associates more strongly with aneurysm growth rate when compared to D-dimer in humans. Finally, intervention with the anti-GPVI antibody (J) in mice with established aneurysms blunted the progression of AAA in two independent mouse models. In conclusion, we show that levels of sGPVI in humans can predict a diagnosis of AAA and AAA growth rate, which may be critical in the identification of high-risk patients. We also identify GPVI as a novel platelet-specific AAA therapeutic target, with minimal risk of adverse bleeding complications, where none currently exist.

KEY POINTSO_LISoluble glycoprotein VI, which is a platelet-derived blood biomarker, predicts a diagnosis of AAA, with high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients with fast from slow-growing AAA.

        <p class="abstract">STRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSWe sought to determine if persistent innate immune signaling via NF{kappa}B occurs in cardiac myocytes in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and if this is associated with myocardial infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells expressing CCR2. We also determined if buccal mucosa cells from young subjects with inherited disease alleles exhibit NF{kappa}B signaling.

BackgroundNF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes disease in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing CCR2-expressing macrophages which promote myocardial injury and arrhythmias. Buccal mucosa cells exhibit pathologic features similar to those seen in cardiac myocytes in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

MethodsWe analyzed myocardium from arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We also analyzed buccal mucosa cells from young subjects with inherited disease alleles. The presence of immunoreactive signal for RelA/p65 in nuclei of cardiac myocytes and buccal cells was used as a reliable indicator of active NF{kappa}B signaling. We also counted myocardial CCR2-expressing cells.

ResultsNF{kappa}B signaling was seen in cardiac myocytes in 34 of 36 cases of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy but in none of 19 age-matched controls. Cells expressing CCR2 were increased in patient hearts in numbers directly correlated with the number of cardiac myocytes showing NF{kappa}B signaling. NF{kappa}B signaling also occurred in buccal cells in young subjects with active disease.

ConclusionsPatients with clinically active arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy exhibit persistent innate immune responses in cardiac myocytes and buccal mucosa cells reflecting an inflammatory process that fails to resolve. Such individuals may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy.

CONDENSED ABSTRACTNF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes arrhythmias and myocardial injury in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing pro-inflammatory CCR2-expressing macrophages to the heart. Based on these new mechanistic insights, we analyzed hearts of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We observed active NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes associated with marked infiltration of CCR2-expressing cells. We also observed NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells obtained from young subjects with active disease. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy may be effective in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Screening buccal cells may be a reliable way to identify patients most likely to benefit.

HIGHLIGHTS- Inflammation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy but the responsible mechanisms and the roles of specific classes of immune cells remain undefined.
- NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes is sufficient to cause disease in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing injurious myeloid cells expressing CCR2 to the heart.
- Here, we provide evidence of persistent NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes and increased CCR2-expressing cells in hearts of patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. We observed a close correlation between the number of cardiac myocytes with active NF{kappa}B signaling and the number of CCR2-expressing cells in patient hearts.
- We also provide evidence of active NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells associated with initial onset of disease and/or disease progression in young subjects with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy alleles.</p>
