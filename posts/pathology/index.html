A recent study proposed the presence of intracellular bacteria in cancer cells, particularly in melanomas and breast cancers, with detectable bacterial DNA. The authors suggested that these bacteria contribute to the tumors development. We sought to replicate these findings using the same experimental methods on different tissue microarrays. Our investigation included 129 breast cancer samples, but we found no evidence of LPS expression within cancer cells. Instead, LPS immunoreactivity was observed in ducts or immune cells, specifically macrophages. The discrepancies in LPS staining warrant caution in interpreting the reported observations, and further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of intracellular bacteria in cancer development.\nAn end-to-end workflow for non-destructive 3D pathology\nAuthors: Bishop, K.

C.\nScore: 138.2, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551845\nRecent advances in 3D pathology offer the ability to image orders-of-magnitude more tissue than conventional pathology while providing a volumetric context that is lacking with 2D tissue sections, all without requiring destructive tissue sectioning. Generating high-quality 3D pathology datasets on a consistent basis is non-trivial, requiring careful attention to many details regarding tissue preparation, imaging, and data/image processing in an iterative process. Here we provide an end-to-end protocol covering all aspects of a 3D pathology workflow (using light-sheet microscopy as an illustrative imaging platform) with sufficient detail to perform well-controlled preclinical and clinical studies. While 3D pathology is compatible with diverse staining protocols and computationally generated color palettes for visual analysis, this protocol will focus on a fluorescent analog of hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E), which remains the most common stain for gold-standard diagnostic determinations. We present our guidelines for a broad range of end-users (e.g., biologists, clinical researchers, and engineers) in a simple tutorial format.\nTreatment with a selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 inhibitor in aged mice rejuvenates multiple organ systems\nAuthors: Tammaro, A.; Daniels, E.

E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555280\nThe process of aging increases the risk of developing age-related diseases, which come at great societal healthcare costs and suffering to individuals. Meanwhile, targeting the basic mechanisms of aging can reduce the risk of developing age-related diseases during aging, essentially resulting in a healthy aging process. Multiple aging pathways exist, which over past decades have systematically been confirmed through gene knockout or overexpression studies in mammals and the ability to increase healthy lifespan. In this work, we perform transcriptome-based drug screening to identify small molecules that mimic the transcriptional profiles of long-lived genetic interventions in mammals. We identify one small molecule whose transcriptional effects mimic diverse known genetic longevity interventions: compound 60 (Cmpd60), which is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and 2 (HDAC2). In line with this, in a battery of molecular, phenotypic, and bioinformatic analyses, in multiple disease cell and animal models, we find that Cmpd60 treatment rejuvenates multiple organ systems. These included the kidney, brain, and heart. In renal aging, Cmpd60 reduced partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and decreased fibrosis in vivo. For the aging brain, Cmpd60 reduced dementia-related gene expression in vivo, effects that were recapitulated when treating the APPSWE-1349 Alzheimer mouse. In cardiac aging, Cmpd60 treatment activated favorable developmental gene expression in vivo and in line with this, improved ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation in a cell model of cardiac hypertrophy. Our work establishes that a systemic, two-week treatment with an HDAC1/2 inhibitor serves as a multi-tissue, healthy aging intervention in mammals. This holds potential for translation towards therapeutics that promote healthy aging in humans.\nNovel Insights into the Aortic Mechanical Properties of Mice Modeling Hereditary Aortic Diseases\nAuthors: Dubacher, N.; Sugiyama, K.; Smith, J. D.; Nussbaumer, V.; Csonka, M.; Ferenczi, S.; Kovacs, K. J.; Caspar, S. M.; Lamberti, L.; Meienberg, J.; Yanagisawa, H.; Sheppard, M. B.; Matyas, G.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553452\nOBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.

        <p class="abstract">The process of aging increases the risk of developing age-related diseases, which come at great societal healthcare costs and suffering to individuals. Meanwhile, targeting the basic mechanisms of aging can reduce the risk of developing age-related diseases during aging, essentially resulting in a  healthy aging process. Multiple aging pathways exist, which over past decades have systematically been confirmed through gene knockout or overexpression studies in mammals and the ability to increase healthy lifespan. In this work, we perform transcriptome-based drug screening to identify small molecules that mimic the transcriptional profiles of long-lived genetic interventions in mammals. We identify one small molecule whose transcriptional effects mimic diverse known genetic longevity interventions: compound 60 (Cmpd60), which is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and 2 (HDAC2). In line with this, in a battery of molecular, phenotypic, and bioinformatic analyses, in multiple disease cell and animal models, we find that Cmpd60 treatment rejuvenates multiple organ systems. These included the kidney, brain, and heart. In renal aging, Cmpd60 reduced partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and decreased fibrosis in vivo. For the aging brain, Cmpd60 reduced dementia-related gene expression in vivo, effects that were recapitulated when treating the APPSWE-1349 Alzheimer mouse. In cardiac aging, Cmpd60 treatment activated favorable developmental gene expression in vivo and in line with this, improved ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation in a cell model of cardiac hypertrophy. Our work establishes that a systemic, two-week treatment with an HDAC1/2 inhibitor serves as a multi-tissue, healthy aging intervention in mammals. This holds potential for translation towards therapeutics that promote healthy aging in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models.

APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice.

CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.
