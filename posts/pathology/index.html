Although an increase in blood cell lineage counts (quantitative features) contribute to these morbid sequelae, the significant qualitative abnormalities of myeloid cells that contribute to vascular risk are not well understood. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap via a comprehensive and untargeted profiling of the platelet proteome in a large (n= 140) cohort of patients (from two independent sites) with an established diagnosis of PV and ET (and complement prior work on the MPN platelet transcriptome from a third site). We discover distinct MPN platelet protein expression and confirm key molecular impairments associated with proteostasis and thrombosis mechanisms of potential relevance to MPN pathology. Specifically, we validate expression of high-priority candidate markers from the platelet transcriptome at the platelet proteome (e.g., calreticulin (CALR), Fc gamma receptor (Fc{gamma}RIIA) and galectin-1 (LGALS1) pointing to their likely significance in the proinflammatory, prothrombotic and profibrotic phenotypes in patients with MPN. Together, our proteo-transcriptomic study identifies the peripherally-derived platelet molecular profile as a potential window into MPN pathophysiology and demonstrates the value of integrative multi-omic approaches in gaining a better understanding of the complex molecular dynamics of disease.\nProtective Role of RIPK1 Scaffolding against HDV-Induced Hepatocyte cell death and the Significance of Cytokines in Mice\nAuthors: Camps, G.; Maestro, S.; Torella, L.; Usai, C.; Aldaz, A.; Olague, C.; Vales, A.; Montfort, A.; Segui, B.; Suarez, L.; Aldabe, R.; Gonzalez-Aseguinolaza, G.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562448\nHepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection represents the most severe form of human viral hepatitis; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathology remain incompletely understood. We recently developed an HDV mouse model by injecting adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) containing replication-competent HBV and HDV genomes. This model replicates many features of human infection, including liver injury. Notably, the extent of liver damage can be diminished with anti-TNF- treatment. In the present study, we found that TNF- is mainly produced by macrophages. Downstream of the TNF- receptor (TNFR), the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) serves as a cell fate regulator, playing roles in both cell survival and death pathways. In this study, we explored the function of RIPK1 and other host factors in HDV-induced cell death. We determined that the scaffolding function of RIPK1, and not its kinase activity, offers partial protection against HDV-induced apoptosis. A reduction in RIPK1 expression in hepatocytes through Cas9-mediated gene editing significantly intensifies HDV-induced damage. Contrary to our expectations, the protective effect of RIPK1 was not linked to TNF- or macrophage activation, as their absence did not alter the extent of damage. Intriguingly, in the absence of RIPK1, macrophages confer a protective role. However, in animals unresponsive to type-I IFNs, RIPK1 downregulation did not exacerbate the damage, suggesting RIPK1s role in shielding hepatocytes from type-I IFN-induced cell death. Interestingly, while the damage extent is similar between IFNAR KO and WT mice in terms of transaminase elevation, their cell death mechanisms differ. In conclusion, our findings reveal that HDV-induced type-I IFN production is central to inducing hepatocyte death, and RIPK1s scaffolding function offers protective benefits. Thus, type-I IFN together with TNF-, contribute to HDV-induced liver damage. These insights may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate HDV-induced liver damage and halt disease progression. Author summaryHepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis. Our manuscript underscores the complexity of HDV-induced liver damage, where both viral and host factors play significant roles. Previously, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of TNF- reduced HDV-induced liver damage. This result was corroborated in the present study using TNF--deficient mice. Moreover, we reported that the expression of the HDV antigen might have a cytotoxic effect, and HDV replication induces a strong activation of the innate immune system, accompanied by a substantial production of IFN-{beta}. In this study, we discovered that RIPK1, a molecule described as a cell fate modulator acting downstream of TNF-, plays a protective role during HDV replication. Contrary to our expectations, neither TNF- nor macrophages, the primary producers of TNF-, contributed to this protective effect. Instead, it seems type I IFN was involved. Interestingly, the role of type I IFN in HBV-induced liver damage has recently been proposed. Furthermore, our data reveals that several mechanisms of hepatocyte death are at play simultaneously during HDV replication, with apoptosis being one of them. Additional studies are needed to identify other mechanisms involved. Finally, these findings suggest that therapies targeting TNF- and type-I IFN, or those increasing RIPK1 levels, might be effective in preventing or treating HDV-induced liver damage.\nThe Overlooked Role of Specimen Preparation in Bolstering Deep Learning-Enhanced Spatial Transcriptomics Workflows\nAuthors: Fatemi, M. Y.; Lu, Y.; Diallo, A. B.; Srinivasan, G.; Azher, Z. L.; Christensen, B. C.; Salas, L. A.; Tsongalis, G. J.; Palisoul, S. M.; Perreard, L.; Kolling, F. W.; Vaickus, L. J.; Levy, J. J.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296700\nThe application of deep learning methods to spatial transcriptomics has shown promise in unraveling the complex relationships between gene expression patterns and tissue architecture as they pertain to various pathological conditions. Deep learning methods that can infer gene expression patterns directly from tissue histomorphology can expand the capability to discern spatial molecular markers within tissue slides. However, current methods utilizing these techniques are plagued by substantial variability in tissue preparation and characteristics, which can hinder the broader adoption of these tools. Furthermore, training deep learning models using spatial transcriptomics on small study cohorts remains a costly endeavor. Necessitating novel tissue preparation processes enhance assay reliability, resolution, and scalability. This study investigated the impact of an enhanced specimen processing workflow for facilitating a deep learning-based spatial transcriptomics assessment. The enhanced workflow leveraged the flexibility of the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated H\u0026E staining (e.g., Leica Bond) of tissue slides, whole-slide imaging at 40x-resolution, and multiplexing of tissue sections from multiple patients within individual capture areas for spatial transcriptomics profiling. Using a cohort of thirteen pT3 stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we compared the efficacy of deep learning models trained on slide prepared using an enhanced workflow as compared to the traditional workflow which leverages manual tissue staining and standard imaging of tissue slides. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we aimed to predict gene expression patterns across matched serial tissue sections, each stemming from a distinct workflow but aligned based on persistent histological structures. Findings indicate that the enhanced workflow considerably outperformed the traditional spatial transcriptomics workflow. Gene expression profiles predicted from enhanced tissue slides also yielded expression patterns more topologically consistent with the ground truth. This led to enhanced statistical precision in pinpointing biomarkers associated with distinct spatial structures. These insights can potentially elevate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker detection by broadening the range of spatial molecular markers linked to metastasis and recurrence. Future endeavors will further explore these findings to enrich our comprehension of various diseases and uncover molecular pathways with greater nuance. Combining deep learning with spatial transcriptomics provides a compelling avenue to enrich our understanding of tumor biology and improve clinical outcomes. For results of the highest fidelity, however, effective specimen processing is crucial, and fostering collaboration between histotechnicians, pathologists, and genomics specialists is essential to herald this new era in spatial transcriptomics-driven cancer research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection represents the most severe form of human viral hepatitis; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathology remain incompletely understood. We recently developed an HDV mouse model by injecting adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) containing replication-competent HBV and HDV genomes. This model replicates many features of human infection, including liver injury. Notably, the extent of liver damage can be diminished with anti-TNF- treatment. In the present study, we found that TNF- is mainly produced by macrophages. Downstream of the TNF- receptor (TNFR), the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) serves as a cell fate regulator, playing roles in both cell survival and death pathways. In this study, we explored the function of RIPK1 and other host factors in HDV-induced cell death. We determined that the scaffolding function of RIPK1, and not its kinase activity, offers partial protection against HDV-induced apoptosis. A reduction in RIPK1 expression in hepatocytes through Cas9-mediated gene editing significantly intensifies HDV-induced damage. Contrary to our expectations, the protective effect of RIPK1 was not linked to TNF- or macrophage activation, as their absence did not alter the extent of damage. Intriguingly, in the absence of RIPK1, macrophages confer a protective role. However, in animals unresponsive to type-I IFNs, RIPK1 downregulation did not exacerbate the damage, suggesting RIPK1s role in shielding hepatocytes from type-I IFN-induced cell death. Interestingly, while the damage extent is similar between IFNAR KO and WT mice in terms of transaminase elevation, their cell death mechanisms differ. In conclusion, our findings reveal that HDV-induced type-I IFN production is central to inducing hepatocyte death, and RIPK1s scaffolding function offers protective benefits. Thus, type-I IFN together with TNF-, contribute to HDV-induced liver damage. These insights may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate HDV-induced liver damage and halt disease progression.

Author summaryHepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis. Our manuscript underscores the complexity of HDV-induced liver damage, where both viral and host factors play significant roles. Previously, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of TNF- reduced HDV-induced liver damage. This result was corroborated in the present study using TNF--deficient mice. Moreover, we reported that the expression of the HDV antigen might have a cytotoxic effect, and HDV replication induces a strong activation of the innate immune system, accompanied by a substantial production of IFN-{beta}. In this study, we discovered that RIPK1, a molecule described as a cell fate modulator acting downstream of TNF-, plays a protective role during HDV replication. Contrary to our expectations, neither TNF- nor macrophages, the primary producers of TNF-, contributed to this protective effect. Instead, it seems type I IFN was involved. Interestingly, the role of type I IFN in HBV-induced liver damage has recently been proposed. Furthermore, our data reveals that several mechanisms of hepatocyte death are at play simultaneously during HDV replication, with apoptosis being one of them. Additional studies are needed to identify other mechanisms involved. Finally, these findings suggest that therapies targeting TNF- and type-I IFN, or those increasing RIPK1 levels, might be effective in preventing or treating HDV-induced liver damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The application of deep learning methods to spatial transcriptomics has shown promise in unraveling the complex relationships between gene expression patterns and tissue architecture as they pertain to various pathological conditions. Deep learning methods that can infer gene expression patterns directly from tissue histomorphology can expand the capability to discern spatial molecular markers within tissue slides. However, current methods utilizing these techniques are plagued by substantial variability in tissue preparation and characteristics, which can hinder the broader adoption of these tools. Furthermore, training deep learning models using spatial transcriptomics on small study cohorts remains a costly endeavor. Necessitating novel tissue preparation processes enhance assay reliability, resolution, and scalability. This study investigated the impact of an enhanced specimen processing workflow for facilitating a deep learning-based spatial transcriptomics assessment. The enhanced workflow leveraged the flexibility of the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated H&amp;E staining (e.g., Leica Bond) of tissue slides, whole-slide imaging at 40x-resolution, and multiplexing of tissue sections from multiple patients within individual capture areas for spatial transcriptomics profiling. Using a cohort of thirteen pT3 stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we compared the efficacy of deep learning models trained on slide prepared using an enhanced workflow as compared to the traditional workflow which leverages manual tissue staining and standard imaging of tissue slides. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we aimed to predict gene expression patterns across matched serial tissue sections, each stemming from a distinct workflow but aligned based on persistent histological structures. Findings indicate that the enhanced workflow considerably outperformed the traditional spatial transcriptomics workflow. Gene expression profiles predicted from enhanced tissue slides also yielded expression patterns more topologically consistent with the ground truth. This led to enhanced statistical precision in pinpointing biomarkers associated with distinct spatial structures. These insights can potentially elevate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker detection by broadening the range of spatial molecular markers linked to metastasis and recurrence. Future endeavors will further explore these findings to enrich our comprehension of various diseases and uncover molecular pathways with greater nuance. Combining deep learning with spatial transcriptomics provides a compelling avenue to enrich our understanding of tumor biology and improve clinical outcomes. For results of the highest fidelity, however, effective specimen processing is crucial, and fostering collaboration between histotechnicians, pathologists, and genomics specialists is essential to herald this new era in spatial transcriptomics-driven cancer research.</p>
