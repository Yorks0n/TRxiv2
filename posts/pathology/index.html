P.; Rybalka, E.; Lindsay, A.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579567\nFemale carriers of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene mutation manifest exercise intolerance and metabolic anomalies that may be exacerbated following menopause due to the loss of estrogen, a known regulator of skeletal muscle function and metabolism. Here, we studied the impact of estrogen depletion (via ovariectomy) on exercise tolerance and muscle mitochondrial metabolism in female mdx mice and the potential of estrogen replacement therapy (using estradiol) to protect against functional and metabolic perturbations. We also investigated the effect of estrogen depletion, and replacement, on the skeletal muscle proteome through an untargeted proteomic approach with TMT-labelling. Our study confirms that loss of estrogen in female mdx mice reduces exercise capacity, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and citrate synthase activity but that these deficits can be offset through estrogen replacement therapy. Furthermore, ovariectomy downregulated protein expression of RNA binding motif factor 20 (Rbm20), a critical regulator of sarcomeric and muscle homeostasis gene splicing, which impacted pathways involving ribosomal and mitochondrial translation. Estrogen replacement modulated Rbm20 protein expression and promoted metabolic processes and the upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. Our data suggests that estrogen mitigates dystrophinopathic features in female mdx mice and that estrogen replacement may be a potential therapy for post-menopausal DMD carriers.\nA drug cocktail of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate enhances resilience to features of early-stage Alzheimer's disease in aging mice\nAuthors: Wezeman, J.; Darvas, M.; Postupna, N.; Klug, J.; Mangalindan, R. S.; Keely, A.; Nguyen, K.; Johnson, C.; Rosenfeld, M.; Ladiges, W.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577437\nThe process of aging is defined by the breakdown of critical maintenance pathways leading to an accumulation of damage and its associated phenotypes. Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice. To test the ability of this drug cocktail to impact Alzheimers disease (AD), an adeno-associated-viral vector model of AD was created. Mice were fed the drug cocktail 2 months prior to injection and allowed 3 months for phenotypic development. Cognitive phenotypes were evaluated through a spatial navigation learning task. To quantify neuropathology, immunohistochemistry was performed for AD proteins and pathways of aging. Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.\nAn image segmentation pipeline optimized for human microglia uncovers sources of morphological diversity in Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: De Jager, R. M.; Lee, A. J.; Sigalov, A.; Taga, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.577128\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, play a crucial role in AD pathology, particularly in relation to amyloid plaques. However, the exact role of plaque-associated microglia and their morphological changes in AD progression remains under debate. In this study, we aimed to establish an automated image segmentation and analysis pipeline optimized for the detection of human microglia, and we assessed its utility by systematically investigating topological relationships between microglia morphology and amyloid plaques. We accessed post-mortem brain tissue samples from persons with AD and utilized immunofluorescence staining to label microglia (IBA1) and amyloid plaques (A{beta}1-42). The acquired images were processed using CellProfiler, an open-source image analysis software, to automatically segment microglia and measure their morphological features. Specifically, since activated (stage III) microglia have a condensed morphology with retracted processes, we prioritized a morphological parameter called \"compactness\" in our analyses to capture shape changes in microglial found in proximity to amyloid plaques. Our results revealed that microglia unassociated with plaques (Mip-) were more abundant than microglia associated with plaques (Mip+) in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) of both men and women with AD. Furthermore, we observed that Mip+ exhibited a significantly more ramified shape and had a higher expression of the IBA1 microglial marker gene compared to Mip. There were no significant differences in microglia morphology between men and women. Our study highlights the utility of automated image analysis in characterizing detailed microglia morphology at the single-cell level and its relationship with AD pathology.\nThe Intricate Relationship of G-Quadruplexes and Bacterial Pathogenicity Islands\nAuthors: Lyu, B.; Song, Q.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548048\nThe dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains of bacteria to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4 structures and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in pathogenic diseases.\nNRP1-expressing myeloid cells promote arteriogenesis in the ischemic limb\nAuthors: Cho, J. S.; Patel, A. S.; Fantin, A.; Ludwinski, F. E.; Pichette, C.; Rudnicki, M.; Denti, L.; Mondragon, A.; Saha, P.; Smith, A.; Ruhrberg, C.; Moderai, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.11.579823\nPeripheral arterial disease can cause limb threatening blood flow restriction, requiring amputation in up to a third of patients despite contemporary treatments. Stimulating new blood vessel growth in ischemic limbs using growth factors such as VEGF-A or supplying mixed cell populations via autologous transplantation has been investigated as a therapy for surgically intractable cases, but to date has proven ineffective in randomised controlled clinical studies. To identify more potent pro-arteriogenic cell populations, we have investigated VEGF-A responsive myeloid cell populations in a mouse model of severe hindlimb ischemia. We found that NRP1 ablation from monocytes and macrophages impaired arteriogenesis in the adductor muscle and flow recovery in the injured limb. Vice versa, the exogenous delivery of NRP1-expressing (but not NRP1-negative) macrophages enhanced arteriogenesis in the adductor and flow recovery in the ischemic limb in a VEGF signalling-dependent manner. Further, patient-derived NRP1-expressing monocytes promoted vascular morphogenesis ex vivo. As the levels of circulating NRP1-expressing monocytes were raised in patients with limb ischemia, the therapeutic delivery of autologous NRP1-expressing monocytes could be explored as a treatment for critical limb ischemia.\nLoss of TIM4-Dependent Efferocytosis in Kupffer CellsPromotes Liver Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis\nAuthors: Shi, H.; Wang, X.; Gerlach, B.; Yurdagul, A.; Moore, M.; Mirshahi, F.; Ronzoni, L.; Sanyal, A.; Valenti, L.; Lin, C.-S.; Tabas, I.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578023\nBackground and aimsHepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the fate of apoptotic hepatocytes in NASH is poorly understood. Herein we explore the hypothesis that impaired TIM4-mediated clearance of dead hepatocytes by liver macrophages (efferocytosis) is impaired in NASH and drives the progression to liver fibrosis. MethodsKupffer cell (KC)-TIM4 expression and efferocytosis were assayed in normal and NASH liver from humans and diet-induced NASH mice. The engulfment of human and mouse apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs was assayed ex vivo. Causation was assessed in NASH mice using anti-TIM4 antibodies, KC-TIM4-knockout, or inducible KC-TIM4 expression, with analyses focused on efferocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and liver fibrosis. ResultsIn human and mouse NASH liver, apoptotic hepatocytes accumulated and was associated with the loss of the KC efferocytosis receptor TIM4. Anti-TIM4 inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs ex vivo, and anti-TIM4 administration to early NASH mice worsened liver macrophage efferocytosis and accelerated the progression to fibrotic NASH. A similar result was obtained by genetically deleting TIM4 in KCs in NASH mice. Most importantly, genetic restoration of macrophage TIM4 in NASH mice enhanced the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and decreased liver fibrosis. ConclusionsThe loss of macrophage TIM4 that occurs during NASH progression impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages, which subsequently promotes the progression to fibrotic NASH. This pathogenic sequence of events can be prevented by restoring macrophage TIM4, suggesting that future therapeutic approaches designed to boost TIM4 expression in liver macrophages could represent a novel strategy to prevent fibrotic NASH progression. Lay summaryNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as the leading cause of liver disease, but the processes leading to liver fibrosis in NASH, which determines clinical outcome, are incompletely understood. Our study provides evidence impaired clearance of dead liver cells by liver macrophages in NASH, which is due to loss of a macrophage receptor called TIM4, contributes to liver fibrosis. Knowledge of this process may suggest new ways to bolster the clearance of dead liver cells in NASH and thereby prevent the progression to liver fibrosis and subsequent liver disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The process of aging is defined by the breakdown of critical maintenance pathways leading to an accumulation of damage and its associated phenotypes. Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice. To test the ability of this drug cocktail to impact Alzheimers disease (AD), an adeno-associated-viral vector model of AD was created. Mice were fed the drug cocktail 2 months prior to injection and allowed 3 months for phenotypic development. Cognitive phenotypes were evaluated through a spatial navigation learning task. To quantify neuropathology, immunohistochemistry was performed for AD proteins and pathways of aging. Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, play a crucial role in AD pathology, particularly in relation to amyloid plaques. However, the exact role of plaque-associated microglia and their morphological changes in AD progression remains under debate. In this study, we aimed to establish an automated image segmentation and analysis pipeline optimized for the detection of human microglia, and we assessed its utility by systematically investigating topological relationships between microglia morphology and amyloid plaques.

We accessed post-mortem brain tissue samples from persons with AD and utilized immunofluorescence staining to label microglia (IBA1) and amyloid plaques (A{beta}1-42). The acquired images were processed using CellProfiler, an open-source image analysis software, to automatically segment microglia and measure their morphological features. Specifically, since activated (stage III) microglia have a condensed morphology with retracted processes, we prioritized a morphological parameter called &#34;compactness&#34; in our analyses to capture shape changes in microglial found in proximity to amyloid plaques.

Our results revealed that microglia unassociated with plaques (Mip-) were more abundant than microglia associated with plaques (Mip&#43;) in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) of both men and women with AD. Furthermore, we observed that Mip&#43; exhibited a significantly more ramified shape and had a higher expression of the IBA1 microglial marker gene compared to Mip. There were no significant differences in microglia morphology between men and women.

Our study highlights the utility of automated image analysis in characterizing detailed microglia morphology at the single-cell level and its relationship with AD pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains of bacteria to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4 structures and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in pathogenic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Peripheral arterial disease can cause limb threatening blood flow restriction, requiring amputation in up to a third of patients despite contemporary treatments. Stimulating new blood vessel growth in ischemic limbs using growth factors such as VEGF-A or supplying mixed cell populations via autologous transplantation has been investigated as a therapy for surgically intractable cases, but to date has proven ineffective in randomised controlled clinical studies. To identify more potent pro-arteriogenic cell populations, we have investigated VEGF-A responsive myeloid cell populations in a mouse model of severe hindlimb ischemia. We found that NRP1 ablation from monocytes and macrophages impaired arteriogenesis in the adductor muscle and flow recovery in the injured limb. Vice versa, the exogenous delivery of NRP1-expressing (but not NRP1-negative) macrophages enhanced arteriogenesis in the adductor and flow recovery in the ischemic limb in a VEGF signalling-dependent manner. Further, patient-derived NRP1-expressing monocytes promoted vascular morphogenesis ex vivo. As the levels of circulating NRP1-expressing monocytes were raised in patients with limb ischemia, the therapeutic delivery of autologous NRP1-expressing monocytes could be explored as a treatment for critical limb ischemia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimsHepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the fate of apoptotic hepatocytes in NASH is poorly understood. Herein we explore the hypothesis that impaired TIM4-mediated clearance of dead hepatocytes by liver macrophages (efferocytosis) is impaired in NASH and drives the progression to liver fibrosis.

MethodsKupffer cell (KC)-TIM4 expression and efferocytosis were assayed in normal and NASH liver from humans and diet-induced NASH mice. The engulfment of human and mouse apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs was assayed ex vivo. Causation was assessed in NASH mice using anti-TIM4 antibodies, KC-TIM4-knockout, or inducible KC-TIM4 expression, with analyses focused on efferocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and liver fibrosis.

ResultsIn human and mouse NASH liver, apoptotic hepatocytes accumulated and was associated with the loss of the KC efferocytosis receptor TIM4. Anti-TIM4 inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs ex vivo, and anti-TIM4 administration to early NASH mice worsened liver macrophage efferocytosis and accelerated the progression to fibrotic NASH. A similar result was obtained by genetically deleting TIM4 in KCs in NASH mice. Most importantly, genetic restoration of macrophage TIM4 in NASH mice enhanced the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and decreased liver fibrosis.

ConclusionsThe loss of macrophage TIM4 that occurs during NASH progression impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages, which subsequently promotes the progression to fibrotic NASH. This pathogenic sequence of events can be prevented by restoring macrophage TIM4, suggesting that future therapeutic approaches designed to boost TIM4 expression in liver macrophages could represent a novel strategy to prevent fibrotic NASH progression.

Lay summaryNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as the leading cause of liver disease, but the processes leading to liver fibrosis in NASH, which determines clinical outcome, are incompletely understood. Our study provides evidence impaired clearance of dead liver cells by liver macrophages in NASH, which is due to loss of a macrophage receptor called TIM4, contributes to liver fibrosis. Knowledge of this process may suggest new ways to bolster the clearance of dead liver cells in NASH and thereby prevent the progression to liver fibrosis and subsequent liver disease.</p>
