P.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296537\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays were widely deployed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for population-scale testing. High-throughput molecular diagnostic labora-tories required a high degree of process automation to cope with huge testing demand, fast turn-around times and quality requirements. However, the critical step of preparing a PCR MasterMix has often been neglected by process developers and optimisers, and is largely dependent upon operator skill for the manual pipetting of reagents to construct the PCR MasterMix. Dependence on manual procedures introduces variation, inconsistency, wastage and potentially risks data integrity. To address this issue, we developed a liquid-handler based solution for automated, traceable and compliant PCR MasterMix preparation. Here, we show that a fully automated PCR MasterMix protocol can substitute manual pipetting, without affecting clinical calling, accuracy or precision. Ultimately, this method reduced cost-per-test at a high-throughput laboratory by eliminating operator-induced wastage while improving the quality of results.\nTRENDS IN CLINICAL STAGE AT PRESENTATION FOR FOUR COMMON ADULT CANCERS IN IBADAN, NIGERIA\nAuthors: Omigbodun, A. O.; Agboola, A. D.; Fayehun, O. A.; Ajisola, M.; Oladejo, A.; Popoola, O.; Lilford, R. J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295952\nIntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria. MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch. ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.\nBeta-catenin inhibition disrupts the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation leading to the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head\nAuthors: Xia, C.; Xu, H.; Fang, L.; Chen, J.; Yuan, W.; Fu, D.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Xiao, L.; Wu, C.; Tong, P.; Chen, D.; Wang, P.; Jin, H.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560853\nGlucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GONFH) is a common refractory joint disease characterized by bone damage and the collapse of femoral head structure. However, the exact pathological mechanisms of GONFH remain unknown. Here, we observed abnormal osteogenesis and adipogenesis associated with decreased beta-catenin in the necrotic femoral head of GONFH patients. In vivo and in vitro studies further revealed that glucocorticoid exposure disrupted osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by inhibiting beta-catenin signaling in glucocorticoid-induced GONFH rats. Col2+ lineage largely contributes to BMSCs, and was found an osteogenic commitment in the femoral head through 9 months of lineage trace. Specific deletion of beta-catenin in Col2+ cells shifted their commitment from osteoblasts to adipocytes, leading to a full spectrum of disease phenotype of GONFH in adult mice. Overall, we uncover that {beta}-catenin inhibition disrupting the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation contribute to the development of GONFH, and identify an ideal genetic modified mouse model of GONFH.\nMMPs and NETs are detrimental in human CNS-tuberculosis and MMP inhibition in a mouse model improves survival\nAuthors: Poh, X. Y.; Loh, F. K.; Bai, C.; Chong, H. T.; Teo, W. K.; Hong, J. M.; Miow, Q. H.; Thong, P. M.; Vilaysane, B.; Hu, T. H.; Chhabra, S.; Wang, Y.; Tiong, S. C.; Fong, S.

M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561002\nDespite anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT), central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) still cause permanent neurological deficits and death. To identify prognostic factors, we profiled a prospective cohort of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and non-TBM patients. We determined significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are up-regulated in TBM patients with neuroradiological abnormalities and poor outcomes. To dissect mechanisms, we created a CNS-TB murine model which show neutrophil-rich necrotizing pyogranulomas with MMP-9 and NETs colocalizing, resembling human CNS-TB. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of both human and murine CNS-TB demonstrates a highly-inflamed and neutrophil-rich microenvironment of inflammatory immune responses, extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis within CNS-TB granulomas. Murine CNS-TB treated with ATT and MMP inhibitors SB-3CT or doxycycline show significantly suppressed NETs with improved survival. MMP inhibition arms show attenuated inflammation and well-formed blood vessels within granulomas. Adjunctive doxycycline is highly promising to improve CNS-TB outcomes and survival.\nSCUBE-1 in The Diagnosis and Follow-Up Of Subclinical Atherosclerosis in The Experimental Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity Model\nAuthors: Kök, M.; Elidag, H. Y.; Aslankoc, R.; Özmen, O.; Dora, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560790\nABSCTRACTO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSObesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that is a global problem, the most crucial complication of which is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease resulting from endothelial dysfunction and accompanying platelet hyperactivity. The presence of the SCUBE-1 protein has been observed within vascular endothelial cells and platelets, both recognized for their pivotal involvement in the arterial thrombosis mechanism. The objective of this research is to examine the utility of serum SCUBE-1 levels in diagnosing and monitoring subclinical atherosclerosis in experimentally induced DM and obese rats. METHODSThe study comprised a cohort of 28 male Sprague-Dawleyrats, which encompassed the following groups: the obese group subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD), the TII-DM group administered HFD in combination with a single dose of streptozocin (STZ), the TI-DM group treated solely with STZ, and the control group. Serum SCUBE1 was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and caspase-3 (Cas-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the liver and pancreas of rats were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTSSerum SCUBE1 levels were significantly higher in the obese and DM groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference among the obese, TI-DM and TII-DM groups. The study identified a significant relationship between serum SCUBE1 level and hepatic CAS3, IL-6 and SOD expression and pancreatic SOD expression. CONCULISONSCUBE1 can be used as a promising novel marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with obesity, TI-DM, and TII-DM\nNEW INSIGHTS INTO THE HEPATIC IRON PHENOTYPE OF BMP6 KNOCKOUT MICE\nAuthors: BESSON, C.; WILLEMETZ, A.; LATOUR, C.; ROBERT, L.; COPPIN, H.; ROTH, M.-P.; CANONNE-HERGAUX, F.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559941\nObjectiveBmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and MethodsLivers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. ResultsIn Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. ConclusionsUnregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporters iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria.

MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018.

ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch.

ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GONFH) is a common refractory joint disease characterized by bone damage and the collapse of femoral head structure. However, the exact pathological mechanisms of GONFH remain unknown. Here, we observed abnormal osteogenesis and adipogenesis associated with decreased beta-catenin in the necrotic femoral head of GONFH patients. In vivo and in vitro studies further revealed that glucocorticoid exposure disrupted osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by inhibiting beta-catenin signaling in glucocorticoid-induced GONFH rats. Col2&#43; lineage largely contributes to BMSCs, and was found an osteogenic commitment in the femoral head through 9 months of lineage trace. Specific deletion of beta-catenin in Col2&#43; cells shifted their commitment from osteoblasts to adipocytes, leading to a full spectrum of disease phenotype of GONFH in adult mice. Overall, we uncover that {beta}-catenin inhibition disrupting the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation contribute to the development of GONFH, and identify an ideal genetic modified mouse model of GONFH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT), central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) still cause permanent neurological deficits and death. To identify prognostic factors, we profiled a prospective cohort of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and non-TBM patients. We determined significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are up-regulated in TBM patients with neuroradiological abnormalities and poor outcomes. To dissect mechanisms, we created a CNS-TB murine model which show neutrophil-rich necrotizing pyogranulomas with MMP-9 and NETs colocalizing, resembling human CNS-TB. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of both human and murine CNS-TB demonstrates a highly-inflamed and neutrophil-rich microenvironment of inflammatory immune responses, extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis within CNS-TB granulomas. Murine CNS-TB treated with ATT and MMP inhibitors SB-3CT or doxycycline show significantly suppressed NETs with improved survival. MMP inhibition arms show attenuated inflammation and well-formed blood vessels within granulomas. Adjunctive doxycycline is highly promising to improve CNS-TB outcomes and survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ABSCTRACTO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSObesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that is a global problem, the most crucial complication of which is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease resulting from endothelial dysfunction and accompanying platelet hyperactivity. The presence of the SCUBE-1 protein has been observed within vascular endothelial cells and platelets, both recognized for their pivotal involvement in the arterial thrombosis mechanism. The objective of this research is to examine the utility of serum SCUBE-1 levels in diagnosing and monitoring subclinical atherosclerosis in experimentally induced DM and obese rats.

METHODSThe study comprised a cohort of 28 male Sprague-Dawleyrats, which encompassed the following groups: the obese group subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD), the TII-DM group administered HFD in combination with a single dose of streptozocin (STZ), the TI-DM group treated solely with STZ, and the control group. Serum SCUBE1 was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and caspase-3 (Cas-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the liver and pancreas of rats were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods.

RESULTSSerum SCUBE1 levels were significantly higher in the obese and DM groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference among the obese, TI-DM and TII-DM groups. The study identified a significant relationship between serum SCUBE1 level and hepatic CAS3, IL-6 and SOD expression and pancreatic SOD expression.

CONCULISONSCUBE1 can be used as a promising novel marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with obesity, TI-DM, and TII-DM</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveBmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice.

Materials and MethodsLivers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis.

ResultsIn Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction.

ConclusionsUnregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporters iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.</p>
