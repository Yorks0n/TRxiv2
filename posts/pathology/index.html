Here by single-cell transcriptome analysis, we describe a concise single-cell atlas, and identify the early changes in cell subpopulations, hair follicle (HF) stem cell fate determination and cell-cell communications in AGA anagen HF units. Thereinto, apoptotic loss of HF progenitor cells is significantly increased, correlated with HF miniaturization in AGA. Mechanistically, enhanced contraction of connective tissue sheath (CTS) activates the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1, which triggers ectopic apoptosis of progenitor cells in human anagen HFs. Continuous CTS contraction during AGA causes long-term loss of progenitor cells via inducing persistent ectopic apoptosis through PIEZO1, eventually leading to premature hair regression. Most importantly, we show that targeting CTS contraction by ML-7, a selective myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor, can obviously improve the growth of HFs from balding scalps of AGA patients. Our study reveals the cellular hierarchies and identifies CTS with increased muscle contraction activity as the key determinant of premature hair regression in AGA, highlighting CTS surrounding human HF as therapeutic targets for treating this disorder.\nCross-Species Variability in Lobular Geometry and Cytochrome P450 Hepatic Zonation: Insights into CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4\nAuthors: Albadry, M.; Kuettner, J.; Grzegorzewski, J.; Dirsch, O.; Kindler, E.; Klopfleisch, R.; Liska, V.; Moulisova, V.; Nickel, S.; Palek, R.; Rosendorf, J.; Saalfeld, S.; Settmacher, U.; Tautenhahn, H.-M.; König, M.; Dahmen, U.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573567\nThis study explores the critical interplay between lobular geometry and the zonated distribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes across species. We present an innovative approach to assess lobular geometry and zonation patterns using whole slide imaging (WSI). This method allows a detailed, systematic comparison of lobular structures and spatial distribution of key CYP450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase in four different species (mouse, rat, pig, and human). Our results shed light on species differences in lobular geometry and enzymatic zonation, providing critical insights for drug metabolism research. Based on our approach we could determine the minimum number of lobules required for a statistically representative analysis, an important piece of information when evaluating liver biopsies and deriving information from WSI.\nAlzheimer's disease copathology in dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with astroglial α-synucleinopathy\nAuthors: Geut, H.; van den Berg, E.; Boon, B. D.; Hoozemans, J. J.; Tunold, J.-A.; Pihlstrom, L.; Jonkman, L. E.; Rozemuller, A. J.; Lemstra, E. A.; van de Berg, W. D. J.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573857\nBackground: In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), co-existence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, i.e. amyloid-{beta} plaques and tau tangles, has been associated with a more rapid disease progression. In post-mortem DLB brains, we examined the association between AD copathology and regional load and morphology of -synuclein pathology. Also, we compared regional load and morphology of AD copathology in DLB to pathology in AD. Methods: We included 50 autopsy-confirmed DLB donors with a clinical DLB phenotype, categorized as having no/low levels of AD copathology (pure DLB, n = 15), or intermediate/high levels of AD copathology (mixed DLB+AD, n = 35), and autopsy-confirmed pure AD donors (n = 14) without -synuclein pathology. We used percentage area of immunopositivity for quantitative assessment of pathology load, and visual scores for semi-quantitative assessment of different morphologies of -synuclein, amyloid-{beta} and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology in fifteen neocortical, limbic and brainstem regions. Results: Mixed DLB+AD compared to pure DLB showed a shorter disease duration (6 {+/-} 3 versus 8 {+/-} 3 years, p = 0.021) and higher frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles. A-synuclein load was higher in neocortical regions (temporal, parietal and occipital), but not in brainstem and limbic regions, which was based upon an increase of Lewy bodies, -synuclein-positive astrocytes and -synuclein-positive plaques in these regions. A-synuclein load was most strongly correlated to amyloid-{beta} and p-tau load in temporal (r = 0.38 and r = 0.50 respectively) and occipital regions (r = 0.43 and r = 0.42 respectively). Compared to pure AD, mixed DLB+AD showed a lower amyloid-{beta} load in temporal cortex, CA3 and CA4 region, and lower p-tau loads in frontal and parietal cortex, based both upon presence of fewer neuritic plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Conclusions: In DLB brains, AD copathology was associated with more neocortical -synuclein pathology, consisting not only of Lewy bodies and plaques, but also of astroglial -synuclein. AD pathology in DLB cases is less than in AD cases, reflecting less advanced pathological stages. Astroglial -synuclein and its relation with AD copathology in DLB should be further studied, as this may play a role in accelerating clinical decline.\nCognitive and molecular characterization of the Ts66Yah murine model of Down syndrome: deepening on hippocampal changes associated with genotype and aging.\nAuthors: Lanzillotta, C.; Rataj-Baniowska, M.; Prestia, F.; Sette, C.; Nalesso, V.; Perluigi, M.; Barone, E.; Duchon, A.; Tramutola, A.; Herault, Y.; Di Domenico, F.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573811\nDown syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.\nHow are APOE4, changes in body weight, and longevity related? Insights from a causal mediation analysis\nAuthors: Holmes, R.; Duan, H.; Bagley, O.; Wu, D.; Loika, Y.; Kulminski, A.; Yashin, A.; Arbeev, K.; Ukraintseva, S.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300485\nThe {varepsilon}4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is known for its negative association with human longevity, however, the mechanism is unclear. APOE4 was also linked to changes in body weight, and the latter changes were associated with survival in some studies. Here we explore the role of aging changes in weight in the connection between APOE4 and longevity, using a Causal Mediation Analysis (CMA) approach to uncovering mechanisms of genetic associations. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data, we tested a hypothesis, whether the association of APOE4 with reduced survival to age 85+ is mediated by key characteristics of age-trajectories of weight, such as age at reaching peak values, and slope of the decline in weight afterwards. Mediation effects were evaluated by the Total Effect (TE), Natural Indirect Effect, and Proportion Mediated. Controlled Direct Effect and Natural Direct Effect are also reported. The CMA results suggest that APOE4 carriers have 19%-22% (TE p=0.019-0.038) lower chances of surviving to age 85 and beyond in part because they reach peak values of weight at younger ages, and their weight declines faster afterwards, compared to non-carriers. This finding is in line with the idea that detrimental effect of APOE4 on longevity is in part related to accelerated physical aging of {varepsilon}4 carriers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">This study explores the critical interplay between lobular geometry and the zonated distribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes across species. We present an innovative approach to assess lobular geometry and zonation patterns using whole slide imaging (WSI). This method allows a detailed, systematic comparison of lobular structures and spatial distribution of key CYP450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase in four different species (mouse, rat, pig, and human). Our results shed light on species differences in lobular geometry and enzymatic zonation, providing critical insights for drug metabolism research. Based on our approach we could determine the minimum number of lobules required for a statistically representative analysis, an important piece of information when evaluating liver biopsies and deriving information from WSI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), co-existence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) pathology, i.e. amyloid-{beta} plaques and tau tangles, has been associated with a more rapid disease progression. In post-mortem DLB brains, we examined the association between AD copathology and regional load and morphology of -synuclein pathology. Also, we compared regional load and morphology of AD copathology in DLB to pathology in AD. Methods: We included 50 autopsy-confirmed DLB donors with a clinical DLB phenotype, categorized as having no/low levels of AD copathology (pure DLB, n = 15), or intermediate/high levels of AD copathology (mixed DLB&#43;AD, n = 35), and autopsy-confirmed pure AD donors (n = 14) without -synuclein pathology. We used percentage area of immunopositivity for quantitative assessment of pathology load, and visual scores for semi-quantitative assessment of different morphologies of -synuclein, amyloid-{beta} and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology in fifteen neocortical, limbic and brainstem regions. Results: Mixed DLB&#43;AD compared to pure DLB showed a shorter disease duration (6 {&#43;/-} 3 versus 8 {&#43;/-} 3 years, p = 0.021) and higher frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles. A-synuclein load was higher in neocortical regions (temporal, parietal and occipital), but not in brainstem and limbic regions, which was based upon an increase of Lewy bodies, -synuclein-positive astrocytes and -synuclein-positive plaques in these regions. A-synuclein load was most strongly correlated to amyloid-{beta} and p-tau load in temporal (r = 0.38 and r = 0.50 respectively) and occipital regions (r = 0.43 and r = 0.42 respectively). Compared to pure AD, mixed DLB&#43;AD showed a lower amyloid-{beta} load in temporal cortex, CA3 and CA4 region, and lower p-tau loads in frontal and parietal cortex, based both upon presence of fewer neuritic plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Conclusions: In DLB brains, AD copathology was associated with more neocortical -synuclein pathology, consisting not only of Lewy bodies and plaques, but also of astroglial -synuclein. AD pathology in DLB cases is less than in AD cases, reflecting less advanced pathological stages. Astroglial -synuclein and its relation with AD copathology in DLB should be further studied, as this may play a role in accelerating clinical decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Down syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The {varepsilon}4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is known for its negative association with human longevity, however, the mechanism is unclear. APOE4 was also linked to changes in body weight, and the latter changes were associated with survival in some studies. Here we explore the role of aging changes in weight in the connection between APOE4 and longevity, using a Causal Mediation Analysis (CMA) approach to uncovering mechanisms of genetic associations. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data, we tested a hypothesis, whether the association of APOE4 with reduced survival to age 85&#43; is mediated by key characteristics of age-trajectories of weight, such as age at reaching peak values, and slope of the decline in weight afterwards. Mediation effects were evaluated by the Total Effect (TE), Natural Indirect Effect, and Proportion Mediated. Controlled Direct Effect and Natural Direct Effect are also reported. The CMA results suggest that APOE4 carriers have 19%-22% (TE p=0.019-0.038) lower chances of surviving to age 85 and beyond in part because they reach peak values of weight at younger ages, and their weight declines faster afterwards, compared to non-carriers. This finding is in line with the idea that detrimental effect of APOE4 on longevity is in part related to accelerated physical aging of {varepsilon}4 carriers.</p>
