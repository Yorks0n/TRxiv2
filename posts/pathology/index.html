S.; Vitkovski, T.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296400\nObjectivesChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI. Its extensive knowledge and unique interactive capabilities enable it to be utilized in various innovative ways in the medical field such as writing clinical notes, simplifying radiology reports. Through this study we aim to analyze its pathology knowledge to advocate its role in transforming pathology education. MethodsAmerican Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Resident Question bank (RQB) 2022 was used to test ChatGPT v4. Practice tests were created in each sub-category and were answered based on the input provided by ChatGPT. Questions that required interpretation of images were excluded. ChatGPTs performance was analyzed and compared with the average peer performance. ResultsThe overall performance of ChatGPT was 56.98%, lower than that of the average peer performance of 62.81%. ChatGPT performed better on clinical pathology (60.42%) than anatomic pathology (54.94%). Furthermore, its performance was better on easy questions (68.47%) compared to intermediate (52.88%) and difficult questions (37.21%). ConclusionsChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable resource in pathology education if trained on a larger, specialized medical dataset. Relying on it solely for the purpose of pathology training should be with caution, in its current form. Key pointsO_LIChatGPT is an AI chatbot, that has gained tremendous popularity in multiple industries, including healthcare. We aim to understand its role in revolutionizing pathology education. C_LIO_LIWe found that ChatGPTs overall performance in Pathology Practice Tests were lower than that expected from an AI tool, furthermore its performance was subpar compared to pathology residents in training. C_LIO_LIIn its current form ChatGPT is not a reliable tool for pathology education, but with further refinement and training it has the potential of being a learning asset.

R.; Grovewood, D.; Dahir, R.; Ruiz-Dana, P. E.; Wisniewska, A.; Di Biase, A.; Gibson, M.; Percival, B.; Grujic, S.; Fraser, D. P.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296537\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays were widely deployed during the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic for population-scale testing. High-throughput molecular diagnostic laboratories required a high degree of process automation to cope with huge testing demand, fast turn-around times and quality requirements. However, the critical step of preparing a PCR MasterMix has often been neglected by process developers and optimisers, and is largely dependent upon operator skill for the manual pipetting of reagents to construct the PCR MasterMix. Dependence on manual procedures introduces variation, inconsistency, wastage and potentially risks data integrity. To address this issue, we developed a liquid-handler based solution for automated, traceable and compliant PCR MasterMix preparation. Here, we show that a fully automated PCR MasterMix protocol can substitute manual pipetting, without affecting clinical calling, accuracy or precision. Ultimately, this method reduced cost-per-test at a high-throughput laboratory by eliminating operator-induced wastage while improving the quality of results.\nTRENDS IN CLINICAL STAGE AT PRESENTATION FOR FOUR COMMON ADULT CANCERS IN IBADAN, NIGERIA\nAuthors: Omigbodun, A.

J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295952\nIntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria. MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch. ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.\niQC: machine-learning-driven prediction of surgical procedure uncovers systematic confounds of cancer whole slide images in specific medical centers\nAuthors: Schaumberg, A. J.; Lewis, M. S.; Nazarian, R.; Wadhwa, A.; Kane, N.; Turner, G.; Karnam, P.; Devineni, P.; Wolfe, N.; Kintner, R.; Rettig, M. B.; Knudsen, B. S.; Garraway, I. P.; Pyarajan, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295798\nProblemThe past decades have yielded an explosion of research using artificial intelligence for cancer detection and diagnosis in the field of computational pathology. Yet, an often unspoken assumption of this research is that a glass microscopy slide faithfully represents the underlying disease. Here we show systematic failure modes may dominate the slides digitized from a given medical center, such that neither the whole slide images nor the glass slides are suitable for rendering a diagnosis. MethodsWe quantitatively define high quality data as a set of whole slide images where the type of surgery the patient received may be accurately predicted by an automated system such as ours, called \"iQC\". We find iQC accurately distinguished biopsies from nonbiopsies, e.g. prostatectomies or transurethral resections (TURPs, a.k.a. prostate chips), only when the data qualitatively appeared to be high quality, e.g. vibrant histopathology stains and minimal artifacts. Crucially, prostate needle biopsies appear as thin strands of tissue, whereas prostatectomies and TURPs appear as larger rectangular blocks of tissue. Therefore, when the data are of high quality, iQC (i) accurately classifies pixels as tissue, (ii) accurately generates statistics that describe the distribution of tissue in a slide, and (iii) accurately predicts surgical procedure. ResultsWhile we do not control any medical centers protocols for making or storing slides, we developed the iQC tool to hold all medical centers and datasets to the same objective standard of quality. We validate this standard across five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and the Automated Gleason Grading Challenge (AGGC) 2022 public dataset. For our surgical procedure prediction task, we report an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.9966-1.000 at the VAMCs that consistently produce high quality data and AUROC of 0.9824 for the AGGC dataset. In contrast, we report an AUROC of 0.7115 at the VAMC that consistently produced poor quality data. An attending pathologist determined poor data quality was likely driven by faded histopathology stains and protocol differences among VAMCs. Specifically, this VAMC produced slides entirely by hand, whereas all other VAMCs leveraged automated methods to produce slides. ConclusionOur surgical procedure prediction AUROC may be a quantitative indicator positively associated with high data quality at a medical center or for a specific dataset. To produce high quality data, we recommend producing slides using robotics or other forms of automation whenever possible. We recommend scanning slides digitally before the glass slide has time to develop signs of age, e.g faded stains and acrylamide bubbles. To our knowledge, iQC is the first automated system in computational pathology that validates data quality against objective evidence, e.g. surgical procedure data available in the EHR or LIMS, which requires zero efforts or annotations from anatomic pathologists.\nScaling use of the rust fungus Puccinia punctiformis for biological control of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.): First report on a U.S. statewide effort\nAuthors: Bean, D. W.; Gladem, K.; Rosen, K.; Blake, A.; Clark, R. E.; Henderson, C.; Kaltenbach, J.; Price, J.; Smallwood, E. L.; Berner, D. K.; Young, S. L.; Schaeffer, R. N.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560232\nCanada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., CT) is one of the worst weeds threatening temperate regions of the world. A host-specific rust fungus, Puccinia punctiformis (F. Strauss) Rohl., is known to cause systemic disease of CT, ultimately killing individuals and reducing stand densities. In 2013, it was demonstrated that fall inoculation of rosettes with coarsely ground leaves bearing P. punctiformis telia can successfully initiate epiphytotics. In the same year, a cooperative project between the Colorado Department of Agriculture and United States Department of Agriculture was initiated, in which CT patches across the state of Colorado (USA) were inoculated and tracked over subsequent years for changes in stem density. Here, we report our findings from 8 years (2014-2021) of monitoring effort. At most sites (N = 87), CT stem densities declined, from a mean (+/- SE) of 87.9 (+/- 6.5) stems to 44.7 (+/- 4.2). These declines however were spatially-autocorrelated, and likely attributable to local growing conditions, as mean annual daily maximum temperature and standard deviation of elevation, as well as climatic conditions around the times of both treatment and monitoring, were found to be important predictors of CT decline. Further, we observed that the amount of inoculum deployed, timing since last release, and method in which it was spread locally at a site were also associated with the magnitude of CT stem decline. These results are indicative of the value of P. punctiformis as a CT biological control agent. The name Cirsium arvense dieback (CADB) is proposed herein to describe the agriculturally important decline in CT stem densities attributable to this previously un-named systemic disease.\nBeta-catenin inhibition disrupts the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation leading to the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head\nAuthors: Xia, C.; Xu, H.; Fang, L.; Chen, J.; Yuan, W.; Fu, D.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Xiao, L.; Wu, C.; Tong, P.; Chen, D.; Wang, P.; Jin, H.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560853\nGlucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GONFH) is a common refractory joint disease characterized by bone damage and the collapse of femoral head structure. However, the exact pathological mechanisms of GONFH remain unknown. Here, we observed abnormal osteogenesis and adipogenesis associated with decreased beta-catenin in the necrotic femoral head of GONFH patients. In vivo and in vitro studies further revealed that glucocorticoid exposure disrupted osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by inhibiting beta-catenin signaling in glucocorticoid-induced GONFH rats. Col2+ lineage largely contributes to BMSCs, and was found an osteogenic commitment in the femoral head through 9 months of lineage trace. Specific deletion of beta-catenin in Col2+ cells shifted their commitment from osteoblasts to adipocytes, leading to a full spectrum of disease phenotype of GONFH in adult mice. Overall, we uncover that {beta}-catenin inhibition disrupting the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation contribute to the development of GONFH, and identify an ideal genetic modified mouse model of GONFH.\nOld foe, new host: epidemiology, genetic diversity and pathogenic characterization of maize streak virus in rice fields from Burkina Faso.\nAuthors: Fouad, N.

Only two viruses impacting rice production in Africa have been deeply investigated for decades: the rice yellow mottle virus (Solemoviridae) and the rice stripe necrosis virus (Benyviridae). Using viral metagenomics, we aimed at exploring the diversity of viruses circulating in Burkina Faso rice fields. We performed an epidemiological survey in this country between 2016 and 2019 involving 57 small farmers rice fields under two production systems (rainfed lowlands and irrigated areas). More than 2700 rice samples were collected without a priori (not based on symptom observation) following a regular scheme. In addition, wild and cultivated (maize and sugarcane) Poaceae growing nearby rice fields were also collected. Unexpectedly, metagenomics detected maize streak virus (MSV, Geminiviridae) in analyzed rice samples. Further molecular analyses using RCA-PCR showed that MSV is widely distributed and highly prevalent in both rainfed lowlands and irrigated rice areas. MSV-A and MSV-G strains were identified. MSV-G, exclusively identified so far in wild grasses, was the most prevalent strain while MSV-A, known to cause severe symptoms in maize, was sporadically identified. No genetic differentiation was detected between MSV isolates either infecting wild or cultivated plant species. Using infectious clones in experimental conditions, we confirmed the pathogenicity of both MSV strains on rice. Thus, in addition to contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of rice production in Africa, our results illuminate new epidemiological and pathogenic aspects of one of the most studied plant viruses with significant economic consequences in Africa.

To identify prognostic factors, we profiled a prospective cohort of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and non-TBM patients. We determined significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are up-regulated in TBM patients with neuroradiological abnormalities and poor outcomes. To dissect mechanisms, we created a CNS-TB murine model which show neutrophil-rich necrotizing pyogranulomas with MMP-9 and NETs colocalizing, resembling human CNS-TB. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of both human and murine CNS-TB demonstrates a highly-inflamed and neutrophil-rich microenvironment of inflammatory immune responses, extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis within CNS-TB granulomas. Murine CNS-TB treated with ATT and MMP inhibitors SB-3CT or doxycycline show significantly suppressed NETs with improved survival. MMP inhibition arms show attenuated inflammation and well-formed blood vessels within granulomas. Adjunctive doxycycline is highly promising to improve CNS-TB outcomes and survival.\nSCUBE-1 in The Diagnosis and Follow-Up Of Subclinical Atherosclerosis in The Experimental Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity Model\nAuthors: Kök, M.; Elidag, H. Y.; Aslankoc, R.; Özmen, O.; Dora, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560790\nBACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that is a global problem, the most crucial complication of which is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease resulting from endothelial dysfunction and accompanying platelet hyperactivity. The presence of the SCUBE-1 protein has been observed within vascular endothelial cells and platelets, both recognized for their pivotal involvement in the arterial thrombosis mechanism. The objective of this research is to examine the utility of serum SCUBE-1 levels in diagnosing and monitoring subclinical atherosclerosis in experimentally induced DM and obese rats. METHODS: The study comprised a cohort of 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which encompassed the following groups: the obese group subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD), the TII-DM group administered HFD in combination with a single dose of streptozocin (STZ), the TI-DM group treated solely with STZ, and the control group. Serum SCUBE1 was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and caspase-3 (Cas-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the liver and pancreas of rats were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: Serum SCUBE1 levels were significantly higher in the obese and DM groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference among the obese, TI-DM and TII-DM groups. The study identified a significant relationship between serum SCUBE1 level and hepatic CAS3, IL-6 and SOD expression and pancreatic SOD expression. CONCULISON: SCUBE1 can be used as a promising novel marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with obesity, TI-DM, and TII-DM.\nNEW INSIGHTS INTO THE HEPATIC IRON PHENOTYPE OF BMP6 KNOCKOUT MICE\nAuthors: BESSON, C.; WILLEMETZ, A.; LATOUR, C.; ROBERT, L.; COPPIN, H.; ROTH, M.-P.; CANONNE-HERGAUX, F.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559941\nObjectiveBmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and MethodsLivers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. ResultsIn Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. ConclusionsUnregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporters iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI. Its extensive knowledge and unique interactive capabilities enable it to be utilized in various innovative ways in the medical field such as writing clinical notes, simplifying radiology reports. Through this study we aim to analyze its pathology knowledge to advocate its role in transforming pathology education.

MethodsAmerican Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Resident Question bank (RQB) 2022 was used to test ChatGPT v4. Practice tests were created in each sub-category and were answered based on the input provided by ChatGPT. Questions that required interpretation of images were excluded. ChatGPTs performance was analyzed and compared with the average peer performance.

ResultsThe overall performance of ChatGPT was 56.98%, lower than that of the average peer performance of 62.81%. ChatGPT performed better on clinical pathology (60.42%) than anatomic pathology (54.94%). Furthermore, its performance was better on easy questions (68.47%) compared to intermediate (52.88%) and difficult questions (37.21%).

ConclusionsChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable resource in pathology education if trained on a larger, specialized medical dataset. Relying on it solely for the purpose of pathology training should be with caution, in its current form.

Key pointsO_LIChatGPT is an AI chatbot, that has gained tremendous popularity in multiple industries, including healthcare. We aim to understand its role in revolutionizing pathology education.
C_LIO_LIWe found that ChatGPTs overall performance in Pathology Practice Tests were lower than that expected from an AI tool, furthermore its performance was subpar compared to pathology residents in training.
C_LIO_LIIn its current form ChatGPT is not a reliable tool for pathology education, but with further refinement and training it has the potential of being a learning asset.

        <p class="abstract">Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays were widely deployed during the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic for population-scale testing. High-throughput molecular diagnostic laboratories required a high degree of process automation to cope with huge testing demand, fast turn-around times and quality requirements. However, the critical step of preparing a PCR MasterMix has often been neglected by process developers and optimisers, and is largely dependent upon operator skill for the manual pipetting of reagents to construct the PCR MasterMix. Dependence on manual procedures introduces variation, inconsistency, wastage and potentially risks data integrity. To address this issue, we developed a liquid-handler based solution for automated, traceable and compliant PCR MasterMix preparation. Here, we show that a fully automated PCR MasterMix protocol can substitute manual pipetting, without affecting clinical calling, accuracy or precision. Ultimately, this method reduced cost-per-test at a high-throughput laboratory by eliminating operator-induced wastage while improving the quality of results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria.

MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018.

ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch.

ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ProblemThe past decades have yielded an explosion of research using artificial intelligence for cancer detection and diagnosis in the field of computational pathology. Yet, an often unspoken assumption of this research is that a glass microscopy slide faithfully represents the underlying disease. Here we show systematic failure modes may dominate the slides digitized from a given medical center, such that neither the whole slide images nor the glass slides are suitable for rendering a diagnosis.

MethodsWe quantitatively define high quality data as a set of whole slide images where the type of surgery the patient received may be accurately predicted by an automated system such as ours, called &#34;iQC&#34;. We find iQC accurately distinguished biopsies from nonbiopsies, e.g. prostatectomies or transurethral resections (TURPs, a.k.a. prostate chips), only when the data qualitatively appeared to be high quality, e.g. vibrant histopathology stains and minimal artifacts. Crucially, prostate needle biopsies appear as thin strands of tissue, whereas prostatectomies and TURPs appear as larger rectangular blocks of tissue. Therefore, when the data are of high quality, iQC (i) accurately classifies pixels as tissue, (ii) accurately generates statistics that describe the distribution of tissue in a slide, and (iii) accurately predicts surgical procedure.

ResultsWhile we do not control any medical centers protocols for making or storing slides, we developed the iQC tool to hold all medical centers and datasets to the same objective standard of quality. We validate this standard across five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and the Automated Gleason Grading Challenge (AGGC) 2022 public dataset. For our surgical procedure prediction task, we report an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.9966-1.000 at the VAMCs that consistently produce high quality data and AUROC of 0.9824 for the AGGC dataset. In contrast, we report an AUROC of 0.7115 at the VAMC that consistently produced poor quality data. An attending pathologist determined poor data quality was likely driven by faded histopathology stains and protocol differences among VAMCs. Specifically, this VAMC produced slides entirely by hand, whereas all other VAMCs leveraged automated methods to produce slides.

ConclusionOur surgical procedure prediction AUROC may be a quantitative indicator positively associated with high data quality at a medical center or for a specific dataset. To produce high quality data, we recommend producing slides using robotics or other forms of automation whenever possible. We recommend scanning slides digitally before the glass slide has time to develop signs of age, e.g faded stains and acrylamide bubbles. To our knowledge, iQC is the first automated system in computational pathology that validates data quality against objective evidence, e.g. surgical procedure data available in the EHR or LIMS, which requires zero efforts or annotations from anatomic pathologists.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., CT) is one of the worst weeds threatening temperate regions of the world. A host-specific rust fungus, Puccinia punctiformis (F. Strauss) Rohl., is known to cause systemic disease of CT, ultimately killing individuals and reducing stand densities. In 2013, it was demonstrated that fall inoculation of rosettes with coarsely ground leaves bearing P. punctiformis telia can successfully initiate epiphytotics. In the same year, a cooperative project between the Colorado Department of Agriculture and United States Department of Agriculture was initiated, in which CT patches across the state of Colorado (USA) were inoculated and tracked over subsequent years for changes in stem density. Here, we report our findings from 8 years (2014-2021) of monitoring effort. At most sites (N = 87), CT stem densities declined, from a mean (&#43;/- SE) of 87.9 (&#43;/- 6.5) stems to 44.7 (&#43;/- 4.2). These declines however were spatially-autocorrelated, and likely attributable to local growing conditions, as mean annual daily maximum temperature and standard deviation of elevation, as well as climatic conditions around the times of both treatment and monitoring, were found to be important predictors of CT decline. Further, we observed that the amount of inoculum deployed, timing since last release, and method in which it was spread locally at a site were also associated with the magnitude of CT stem decline. These results are indicative of the value of P. punctiformis as a CT biological control agent. The name Cirsium arvense dieback (CADB) is proposed herein to describe the agriculturally important decline in CT stem densities attributable to this previously un-named systemic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GONFH) is a common refractory joint disease characterized by bone damage and the collapse of femoral head structure. However, the exact pathological mechanisms of GONFH remain unknown. Here, we observed abnormal osteogenesis and adipogenesis associated with decreased beta-catenin in the necrotic femoral head of GONFH patients. In vivo and in vitro studies further revealed that glucocorticoid exposure disrupted osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by inhibiting beta-catenin signaling in glucocorticoid-induced GONFH rats. Col2&#43; lineage largely contributes to BMSCs, and was found an osteogenic commitment in the femoral head through 9 months of lineage trace. Specific deletion of beta-catenin in Col2&#43; cells shifted their commitment from osteoblasts to adipocytes, leading to a full spectrum of disease phenotype of GONFH in adult mice. Overall, we uncover that {beta}-catenin inhibition disrupting the homeostasis of osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation contribute to the development of GONFH, and identify an ideal genetic modified mouse model of GONFH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rice is of critical significance regarding food security worldwide including in Africa. Only two viruses impacting rice production in Africa have been deeply investigated for decades: the rice yellow mottle virus (Solemoviridae) and the rice stripe necrosis virus (Benyviridae). Using viral metagenomics, we aimed at exploring the diversity of viruses circulating in Burkina Faso rice fields. We performed an epidemiological survey in this country between 2016 and 2019 involving 57 small farmers rice fields under two production systems (rainfed lowlands and irrigated areas). More than 2700 rice samples were collected without a priori (not based on symptom observation) following a regular scheme. In addition, wild and cultivated (maize and sugarcane) Poaceae growing nearby rice fields were also collected. Unexpectedly, metagenomics detected maize streak virus (MSV, Geminiviridae) in analyzed rice samples. Further molecular analyses using RCA-PCR showed that MSV is widely distributed and highly prevalent in both rainfed lowlands and irrigated rice areas. MSV-A and MSV-G strains were identified. MSV-G, exclusively identified so far in wild grasses, was the most prevalent strain while MSV-A, known to cause severe symptoms in maize, was sporadically identified. No genetic differentiation was detected between MSV isolates either infecting wild or cultivated plant species. Using infectious clones in experimental conditions, we confirmed the pathogenicity of both MSV strains on rice. Thus, in addition to contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of rice production in Africa, our results illuminate new epidemiological and pathogenic aspects of one of the most studied plant viruses with significant economic consequences in Africa.

        <p class="abstract">Despite anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT), central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) still cause permanent neurological deficits and death. To identify prognostic factors, we profiled a prospective cohort of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and non-TBM patients. We determined significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are up-regulated in TBM patients with neuroradiological abnormalities and poor outcomes. To dissect mechanisms, we created a CNS-TB murine model which show neutrophil-rich necrotizing pyogranulomas with MMP-9 and NETs colocalizing, resembling human CNS-TB. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of both human and murine CNS-TB demonstrates a highly-inflamed and neutrophil-rich microenvironment of inflammatory immune responses, extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis within CNS-TB granulomas. Murine CNS-TB treated with ATT and MMP inhibitors SB-3CT or doxycycline show significantly suppressed NETs with improved survival. MMP inhibition arms show attenuated inflammation and well-formed blood vessels within granulomas. Adjunctive doxycycline is highly promising to improve CNS-TB outcomes and survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that is a global problem, the most crucial complication of which is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease resulting from endothelial dysfunction and accompanying platelet hyperactivity. The presence of the SCUBE-1 protein has been observed within vascular endothelial cells and platelets, both recognized for their pivotal involvement in the arterial thrombosis mechanism. The objective of this research is to examine the utility of serum SCUBE-1 levels in diagnosing and monitoring subclinical atherosclerosis in experimentally induced DM and obese rats. METHODS: The study comprised a cohort of 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which encompassed the following groups: the obese group subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD), the TII-DM group administered HFD in combination with a single dose of streptozocin (STZ), the TI-DM group treated solely with STZ, and the control group. Serum SCUBE1 was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and caspase-3 (Cas-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the liver and pancreas of rats were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: Serum SCUBE1 levels were significantly higher in the obese and DM groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference among the obese, TI-DM and TII-DM groups. The study identified a significant relationship between serum SCUBE1 level and hepatic CAS3, IL-6 and SOD expression and pancreatic SOD expression. CONCULISON: SCUBE1 can be used as a promising novel marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with obesity, TI-DM, and TII-DM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveBmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice.

Materials and MethodsLivers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis.

ResultsIn Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction.

ConclusionsUnregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporters iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.</p>
