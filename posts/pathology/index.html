Recent advances in trace sample proteomics have enabled quantitative protein abundance datasets from single human MNs (Cong et al., 2020b). In this study, we leveraged laser capture microdissection (LCM) and nanoPOTS (Zhu et al., 2018c) single-cell mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to query changes in protein expression in single MNs from postmortem ALS and control donor spinal cord tissues, leading to the identification of 2515 proteins across MNs samples (\u003e900 per single MN) and quantitative comparison of 1870 proteins between disease groups. Furthermore, we studied the impact of enriching/stratifying MN proteome samples based on the presence and extent of immunoreactive, cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions, allowing identification of 3368 proteins across MNs samples and profiling of 2238 proteins across TDP-43 strata. We found extensive overlap in differential protein abundance profiles between MNs with or without obvious TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions that together point to early and sustained dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, mRNA splicing and translation, and retromer-mediated vesicular transport in ALS. Our data are the first unbiased quantification of single MN protein abundance changes associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy and begin to demonstrate the utility of pathology-stratified trace sample proteomics for understanding single-cell protein abundance changes in human neurologic diseases.\nExtended correlation functions for spatial analysis of multiplex imaging data\nAuthors: Bull, J. A.; Mulholland, E. J.; Leedham, S. J.; Byrne, H. M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545678\nImaging platforms for generating highly multiplexed histological images are being continually developed and improved. Significant improvements have also been made in the accuracy of methods for automated cell segmentation and classification. However, less attention has focussed on the quantification and analysis of the resulting point clouds which describe the spatial coordinates of individual cells. We focus here on a particular spatial statistical method, the cross-pair correlation function (cross-PCF), which can identify positive and negative spatial correlation between cells across a range of length scales. However, limitations of the cross-PCF hinder its widespread application to multiplexed histology. For example, it can only consider relations between pairs of cells, and cells must be classified using discrete categorical labels (rather than labelling continuous labels such as stain intensity). In this paper, we present three extensions to the cross-PCF which address these limitations and permit more detailed analysis of multiplex images: Topographical Correlation Maps (TCMs) can visualise local clustering and exclusion between cells; Neighbourhood Correlation Functions (NCFs) can identify colocalisation of two or more cell types; and weighted-PCFs (wPCFs) describe spatial correlation between points with continuous (rather than discrete) labels. We apply the extended PCFs to synthetic and biological datasets in order to demonstrate the insight that they can generate. Impact statementThis paper introduces three methods for performing spatial analysis on multiplex digital pathology images. We apply the methods to synthetic datasets and regions of interest from a murine colorectal carcinoma, in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. We note that these methods have wider application to marked point pattern data from other sources.\nObserver-rated outcomes of Communication-Centered Treatment (CCT) for adults who stutter: A preliminary study\nAuthors: Byrd, C. T.; Coalson, G.; Werle, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23290720\nPrevious studies have reported that adults who stutter demonstrate significant gains in communication competence, per self-ratings and clinician-ratings, upon completion of a communication-centered treatment, or CCT. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether gains in communication competence would also be reported by untrained observers. Eighty-one untrained observers completed an online survey that required each to view one of two videos depicting an adult who stutters during a mock interview recorded prior to CCT or after CCT. Participants were then asked to rate the communication competence of the interviewee on a 100-point visual analog scale and provide additional demographic information. Communication competence of the adult who stutters was rated significantly higher in their post-treatment video. Two observer-based factors were significantly associated with ratings of communication competence: years of education and years the respondent had known an adult who stutters. Upon controlling for these demographic factors, significantly higher ratings of communication competence for the post-treatment video were maintained. Although preliminary, findings suggest gains in communication competence demonstrated in previous studies through clinician and client observations are not limited to the sterile clinical environment, and further emphasizes the ecological validity of CCT.

F.; Quillfeldt, P.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545710\nAvian haemosporidians are vector-borne blood parasites, which infect a great variety of avian host species. The order Passeriformes has the highest average infection probability; nevertheless, some common species of this order have been rather poorly studied in terms of haemosporidian prevalence and diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of haemosporidians in one of such species, the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (Corvidae), from a forest population in Hesse, Central Germany. All individuals were infected with at least one haemosporidian genus, i.e. an overall prevalence of 100%. The most common infection pattern was a mixed infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas no Plasmodium infection was detected. Our results regarding lineage diversity combined with data from other studies indicate a rather pronounced host-specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages infecting birds of the family Corvidae.\nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit differential gastro-intestinal tropism and pathogenesis in the Syrian golden hamster model.\nAuthors: Nagraj, S. K.; Joy, C. M.; Narayan, R.; Shiraz, R.; Kaur, S.; Khatun, O.; Dubey, S.; Tripathi, S.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545534\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken its toll on worldwide public health infrastructure. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to exhibit wide tissue tropism, contributing to its severe pathogenicity that often culminates in multiple-organ failure. The onslaught of this disease has intensified due to the emergence of variants of concern (VOC), such as Delta and Omicron. These variants have been linked to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, suggesting a potential fecal-oral route of viral transmission. Here we compared the broad tissue tropism of ancestral Hong-Kong SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 HK) against Delta and Omicron VOCs in aa hamster model by analyzing tissue samples collected from the upper and lower respiratory system and the GI tract. We observed an overall increase in vRNA load and pro- inflammatory cytokines, especially in GI tracts of animals infected with Delta virus, indicating selective virus tropism and pathology in these tissues. However, no apparent spike in Delta viral load was observed in the large intestine and fecal matter. Overall, our research investigates the wide range of tissues that various SARS-CoV-2 strains can infect in hamsters and presents evidence supporting the increased preference of Delta VOCs for infecting the GI tract.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Imaging platforms for generating highly multiplexed histological images are being continually developed and improved. Significant improvements have also been made in the accuracy of methods for automated cell segmentation and classification. However, less attention has focussed on the quantification and analysis of the resulting point clouds which describe the spatial coordinates of individual cells. We focus here on a particular spatial statistical method, the cross-pair correlation function (cross-PCF), which can identify positive and negative spatial correlation between cells across a range of length scales. However, limitations of the cross-PCF hinder its widespread application to multiplexed histology. For example, it can only consider relations between pairs of cells, and cells must be classified using discrete categorical labels (rather than labelling continuous labels such as stain intensity).

In this paper, we present three extensions to the cross-PCF which address these limitations and permit more detailed analysis of multiplex images: Topographical Correlation Maps (TCMs) can visualise local clustering and exclusion between cells; Neighbourhood Correlation Functions (NCFs) can identify colocalisation of two or more cell types; and weighted-PCFs (wPCFs) describe spatial correlation between points with continuous (rather than discrete) labels. We apply the extended PCFs to synthetic and biological datasets in order to demonstrate the insight that they can generate.

Impact statementThis paper introduces three methods for performing spatial analysis on multiplex digital pathology images. We apply the methods to synthetic datasets and regions of interest from a murine colorectal carcinoma, in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. We note that these methods have wider application to marked point pattern data from other sources.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previous studies have reported that adults who stutter demonstrate significant gains in communication competence, per self-ratings and clinician-ratings, upon completion of a communication-centered treatment, or CCT. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether gains in communication competence would also be reported by untrained observers. Eighty-one untrained observers completed an online survey that required each to view one of two videos depicting an adult who stutters during a mock interview recorded prior to CCT or after CCT. Participants were then asked to rate the communication competence of the interviewee on a 100-point visual analog scale and provide additional demographic information. Communication competence of the adult who stutters was rated significantly higher in their post-treatment video. Two observer-based factors were significantly associated with ratings of communication competence: years of education and years the respondent had known an adult who stutters. Upon controlling for these demographic factors, significantly higher ratings of communication competence for the post-treatment video were maintained. Although preliminary, findings suggest gains in communication competence demonstrated in previous studies through clinician and client observations are not limited to the sterile clinical environment, and further emphasizes the ecological validity of CCT.

        <p class="abstract">Avian haemosporidians are vector-borne blood parasites, which infect a great variety of avian host species. The order Passeriformes has the highest average infection probability; nevertheless, some common species of this order have been rather poorly studied in terms of haemosporidian prevalence and diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of haemosporidians in one of such species, the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (Corvidae), from a forest population in Hesse, Central Germany. All individuals were infected with at least one haemosporidian genus, i.e. an overall prevalence of 100%. The most common infection pattern was a mixed infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas no Plasmodium infection was detected. Our results regarding lineage diversity combined with data from other studies indicate a rather pronounced host-specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages infecting birds of the family Corvidae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken its toll on worldwide public health infrastructure. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to exhibit wide tissue tropism, contributing to its severe pathogenicity that often culminates in multiple-organ failure. The onslaught of this disease has intensified due to the emergence of variants of concern (VOC), such as Delta and Omicron. These variants have been linked to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, suggesting a potential fecal-oral route of viral transmission. Here we compared the broad tissue tropism of ancestral Hong-Kong SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 HK) against Delta and Omicron VOCs in aa hamster model by analyzing tissue samples collected from the upper and lower respiratory system and the GI tract. We observed an overall increase in vRNA load and pro- inflammatory cytokines, especially in GI tracts of animals infected with Delta virus, indicating selective virus tropism and pathology in these tissues. However, no apparent spike in Delta viral load was observed in the large intestine and fecal matter. Overall, our research investigates the wide range of tissues that various SARS-CoV-2 strains can infect in hamsters and presents evidence supporting the increased preference of Delta VOCs for infecting the GI tract.</p>
