Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels are routinely used to analyze a limited number of genes to guide treatment decision making for advanced stage patients. The number and complexity of genetic alterations to be investigated are rapidly growing, in several instances a comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) analysis is required. The poor quality of genetic material extracted from FFPE samples may impact the feasibility/reliability of sequencing data. We sampled 9 colorectal cancers to allow 4 parallel fixations: i) neutral buffered formalin (NBF); ii) acid-deprived formalin fixation (ADF); iii) pre-cooled ADF (coldADF); iv) Glyoxal Acid-Free (GAF). DNA extraction, fragmentation analysis and sequencing by using two large NGS panels (OCAv3, TSO500) followed. We comprehensively analyzed library and sequencing QCs, and the quality of sequencing results. Libraries from coldADF samples showed significantly longer reads than the others with both panels. ADF and coldADF derived libraries showed the lowest level of noise and the highest levels of uniformity with the OCAv3 panel, followed by GAF and NBF samples. The data uniformity was confirmed by TSO500 results, which also highlighted the best performance in terms of total region sequenced for ADF and coldADF samples. NBF samples had a significantly smaller region sequenced, displayed a significantly lower number of evaluable MS loci and a significant increase in SNVs compared to other protocols. The mutational Signature 1 (aging-, FFPE artifact-related) showed the highest (37%) and the lowest (17%) values in NBF and coldADF samples, respectively. Most of identified genetic alterations were shared by all samples in each lesion. Five genes showed a different mutational status across samples and/or panels: four discordant results involved NBF samples. In conclusion, acid-deprived fixatives guarantee the highest DNA preservation/sequencing performance, suggesting possible implementation of even more complex molecular profiling on tissue samples.\nPredominant myosin super-relaxed state in canine myocardium with naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: Ochala, J.; Lewis, C. T. A.; Beck, T.; Iwamoto, H.; Hessel, A.; Campbell, K.; Pyle, G.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.10.532046\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a naturally occurring heart failure condition in humans and dogs, notably characterized by a reduced contractility and ejection fraction. As the identification of its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incomplete, the aim of the present study was to assess whether the molecular motor myosin and its known relaxed conformational states are altered in DCM. For that, we dissected and skinned thin cardiac strips from left ventricle obtained from six DCM Doberman Pinschers and six non-failing controls (NF). We then used a combination of Mant-ATP chase experiments and X-ray diffraction to assess both energetic and structural changes of myosin. Using the Mant-ATP chase protocol, we observed that in DCM dogs, the amount of myosin molecules in the ATP-conserving conformational state also known as super-relaxed (SRX), is significantly increased when compared with NF dogs. This alteration can be rescued by applying EMD-57033, a small molecule activating myosin. Conversely, with X-ray diffraction, we found that in DCM dogs, there is a higher proportion of myosin heads in the vicinity of actin when compared with NF dogs (1,0 to 1,1 intensity ratio). Hence, we observed an uncoupling between energetic (Mant-ATP chase) and structural (X-ray diffraction) data. Taken together, these results may indicate that in the heart of Doberman Pinschers with DCM, myosin molecules are potentially stuck in a non-sequestered but ATP-conserving SRX state, that can be counterbalanced by EMD-57033 demonstrating the potential for a myosin-centered pharmacological treatment of DCM. New \u0026 noteworthyThe key finding of the present study is that, in left ventricles of dogs with a naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy, relaxed myosin molecules favor a non-sequestered super-relaxed state potentially impairing sarcomeric contractility. This alteration is rescuable by applying a small molecule activating myosin known as EMD-57033.\nClinical Significance of the Stromatic Component in Ovarian Cancer: Quantity Over Quality in Outcome Prediction\nAuthors: Lou, E.; Clemente, V.; Grube, M.; Svedbom, A.; Nelson, A. C.; Blome, F.; Staebler, A.; Kommoss, S.; Bazzaro, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546712\nBackgroundThe tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer. MethodsThis study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H\u0026E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors. ResultsWe found that high TSP (\u003e50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644. ConclusionsIn HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.\nMelatonin Targets MoIcl1 and Works Synergistically with Fungicide Isoprothiolane in Rice Blast Control\nAuthors: Li, G.; Bi, R.; Li, R. j.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547317\nMelatonin-a natural harmless molecule-displays versatile roles in human health and crop disease control such as for rice blast. Rice blast, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one devastating disease of rice. Application of fungicides is one of the major measures in the control of various crop diseases. However, fungicide resistance in the pathogen and relevant environmental pollution are becoming serious problems. By screening for possible synergistic combinations, here, we discovered an eco-friendly combination for rice blast control, melatonin and the fungicide isoprothiolane. These compounds together exhibited significant synergistic inhibitory effects on vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, penetration, and plant infection by M. oryzae. The combination of melatonin and isoprothiolane reduced the effective concentration of isoprothiolane by over 10-fold as well as residual levels of isoprothiolane. Transcriptomics and lipidomics revealed that melatonin and isoprothiolane synergistically interfered with lipid metabolism by regulating many common targets, including the predicted isocitrate lyase-encoding gene MoICL1. Furthermore, we show that melatonin and isoprothiolane interact with MoIcl1 using different techniques. This study demonstrates that melatonin and isoprothiolane function synergistically and can be used to reduce the dosage and residual level of isoprothiolane, potentially contributing to the environment-friendly and sustainable control of crop diseases.\nHistone deacetylase 3 plays a critical role in hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis\nAuthors: An, C.; Jiao, B.; Du, H.; Tran, M.; Song, B.; Wang, P.; Hu, Z.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Y.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546796\nObjective: Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. The molecular mechanisms how hypertension causes kidney disease are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease. Approach and Results: Myeloid HDAC3 knockout mice were generated by crossing HDAC3f/f mice with LysM-Cre+/- mice. Both LysM-Cre-/-HDAC3f/f (HDAC3CON) mice and LysM-Cre+/+HDAC3f/f (HDAC3MKO) mice were subjected to uninephrectomy and treated with angiotensin II at 1.5 ug/kg/min or vehicle for 28 days. Blood pressure increased comparably in both HDAC3CON and HDAC3MKO mice following angiotensin II treatment. Compared with HDAC3CON mice, HDAC3MKO mice were protected from angiotensin II-induced kidney dysfunction and pathological injury and developed less proteinuria. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency markedly attenuated the protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, and ?-SMA in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. Furthermore, HDAC3MKO mice accumulated significantly fewer myeloid fibroblasts and macrophages in the kidney after angiotensin II treatment. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency significantly reduced the mRNA expression of proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. In cultured macrophages, knockdown of HDAC3 with shRNA suppressed proinflammatory molecule expression. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC3 inhibited NF-kB p65 enrichment to IL-6 promoter. Conclusion: Our study identifies a critical role of myeloid HDAC3 in the regulation of hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting HDAC3 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertensive kidney disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples represent the cornerstone of tissue-based analysis in precision medicine. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels are routinely used to analyze a limited number of genes to guide treatment decision making for advanced stage patients. The number and complexity of genetic alterations to be investigated are rapidly growing, in several instances a comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) analysis is required.

NBF samples had a significantly smaller region sequenced, displayed a significantly lower number of evaluable MS loci and a significant increase in SNVs compared to other protocols. The mutational Signature 1 (aging-, FFPE artifact-related) showed the highest (37%) and the lowest (17%) values in NBF and coldADF samples, respectively.

Most of identified genetic alterations were shared by all samples in each lesion. Five genes showed a different mutational status across samples and/or panels: four discordant results involved NBF samples.

In conclusion, acid-deprived fixatives guarantee the highest DNA preservation/sequencing performance, suggesting possible implementation of even more complex molecular profiling on tissue samples.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a naturally occurring heart failure condition in humans and dogs, notably characterized by a reduced contractility and ejection fraction. As the identification of its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incomplete, the aim of the present study was to assess whether the molecular motor myosin and its known relaxed conformational states are altered in DCM. For that, we dissected and skinned thin cardiac strips from left ventricle obtained from six DCM Doberman Pinschers and six non-failing controls (NF). We then used a combination of Mant-ATP chase experiments and X-ray diffraction to assess both energetic and structural changes of myosin. Using the Mant-ATP chase protocol, we observed that in DCM dogs, the amount of myosin molecules in the ATP-conserving conformational state also known as super-relaxed (SRX), is significantly increased when compared with NF dogs. This alteration can be rescued by applying EMD-57033, a small molecule activating myosin. Conversely, with X-ray diffraction, we found that in DCM dogs, there is a higher proportion of myosin heads in the vicinity of actin when compared with NF dogs (1,0 to 1,1 intensity ratio). Hence, we observed an uncoupling between energetic (Mant-ATP chase) and structural (X-ray diffraction) data. Taken together, these results may indicate that in the heart of Doberman Pinschers with DCM, myosin molecules are potentially stuck in a non-sequestered but ATP-conserving SRX state, that can be counterbalanced by EMD-57033 demonstrating the potential for a myosin-centered pharmacological treatment of DCM.

New &amp; noteworthyThe key finding of the present study is that, in left ventricles of dogs with a naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy, relaxed myosin molecules favor a non-sequestered super-relaxed state potentially impairing sarcomeric contractility. This alteration is rescuable by applying a small molecule activating myosin known as EMD-57033.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer.

MethodsThis study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H&amp;E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors.

ResultsWe found that high TSP (&gt;50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644.

ConclusionsIn HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Melatonin-a natural harmless molecule-displays versatile roles in human health and crop disease control such as for rice blast. Rice blast, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one devastating disease of rice. Application of fungicides is one of the major measures in the control of various crop diseases. However, fungicide resistance in the pathogen and relevant environmental pollution are becoming serious problems. By screening for possible synergistic combinations, here, we discovered an eco-friendly combination for rice blast control, melatonin and the fungicide isoprothiolane. These compounds together exhibited significant synergistic inhibitory effects on vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, penetration, and plant infection by M. oryzae. The combination of melatonin and isoprothiolane reduced the effective concentration of isoprothiolane by over 10-fold as well as residual levels of isoprothiolane. Transcriptomics and lipidomics revealed that melatonin and isoprothiolane synergistically interfered with lipid metabolism by regulating many common targets, including the predicted isocitrate lyase-encoding gene MoICL1. Furthermore, we show that melatonin and isoprothiolane interact with MoIcl1 using different techniques. This study demonstrates that melatonin and isoprothiolane function synergistically and can be used to reduce the dosage and residual level of isoprothiolane, potentially contributing to the environment-friendly and sustainable control of crop diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. The molecular mechanisms how hypertension causes kidney disease are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease. Approach and Results: Myeloid HDAC3 knockout mice were generated by crossing HDAC3f/f mice with LysM-Cre&#43;/- mice. Both LysM-Cre-/-HDAC3f/f (HDAC3CON) mice and LysM-Cre&#43;/&#43;HDAC3f/f (HDAC3MKO) mice were subjected to uninephrectomy and treated with angiotensin II at 1.5 ug/kg/min or vehicle for 28 days. Blood pressure increased comparably in both HDAC3CON and HDAC3MKO mice following angiotensin II treatment. Compared with HDAC3CON mice, HDAC3MKO mice were protected from angiotensin II-induced kidney dysfunction and pathological injury and developed less proteinuria. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency markedly attenuated the protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, and ?-SMA in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. Furthermore, HDAC3MKO mice accumulated significantly fewer myeloid fibroblasts and macrophages in the kidney after angiotensin II treatment. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency significantly reduced the mRNA expression of proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. In cultured macrophages, knockdown of HDAC3 with shRNA suppressed proinflammatory molecule expression. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC3 inhibited NF-kB p65 enrichment to IL-6 promoter. Conclusion: Our study identifies a critical role of myeloid HDAC3 in the regulation of hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting HDAC3 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertensive kidney disease.</p>
