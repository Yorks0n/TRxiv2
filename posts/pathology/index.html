G.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572180\nThe majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19+ patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19+ patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19+ patients.\nIntegrated histopathology, spatial and single cell transcriptomics resolve cellular drivers of early and late alveolar damage in COVID-19\nAuthors: Lee, J. T. H.; Barnett, S. N.; Roberts, K.; Ashwin, H.; Milross, L.; Cho, J.-W.; Huseynov, A.; Woodhams, B.; Aivazidis, A.; Li, T.; Majo, J.; Guerrero, P. C.; Lee, M.; Miranda, A. M. A.; Jablonska, Z.; Arena, V.; Hanley, B.; Osborn, M.; Uhlmann, V.; Xu, X.-N.; McLean, G. R.; Teichmann, S. A.; Randi, A. M.; Filby, A.; Kaye, P. M.; Fisher, A. J.; Hemberg, M.; Noseda, M.; Bayraktar, O. A.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572494\nThe most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.\nAn ovine model for investigation of the microenvironment of the male mammary gland\nAuthors: Davies, B. P.; Crew, R. C.; Cochrane, A. L. K.; Davies, K.; Baptista, A. F.; Jeckel, S.; McCrone, I.; Niu, Y.; Strugnell, B. W.; Waine, K.; Fowden, A. L.; Bryant, C. E.; Wills, J. W.; Giussani, D. A.; Hughes, K.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572059\nThe specific biology of the male breast remains relatively unexplored in spite of the increasing global prevalence of male breast cancer. Delineation of the microenvironment of the male breast is restricted by the low availability of human samples and a lack of characterisation of appropriate animal models. Unlike the mouse, the male ovine gland persists postnatally. We suggest that the male ovine mammary gland constitutes a promising adjunctive model for the male human breast. In this study we evaluate the male ovine mammary gland microenvironment, comparing intact and neutered males. Assessment of the glandular histo-anatomy highlights the resemblance of the male gland to that of the neonatal female sheep and confirms the presence of rudimentary terminal duct lobular units. Irrespective of neutered status, cell proliferation in epithelial and stromal compartments is low in males, and cell proliferation in epithelial cells and in the intralobular stroma is significantly lower than in pubertal female sheep. Between 42% and 72% of the luminal mammary epithelial cells in the male gland express the androgen receptor, and expression is significantly reduced by neutering. Luminal epithelial cells within the intact and neutered male gland also express oestrogen receptor alpha, but minimal progesterone receptor expression is observed. The distrubution of mammary leukocytes within the ducts and stroma is similar in the female mammary gland of sheep and other species. Both macrophages and T lymphocytes are intercalated in the epithelial bilayer and are more abundant in the intralobular stroma than the interlobular stroma, suggesting that they may have a protective immunological function within the vestigial glandular tissue of the male sheep. Mast cells are also observed within the stroma. These cells cluster nearer the glandular tissue and are frequently located adjacent to blood vessels. The abundance of mast cells is significantly higher in intact males compared to neutered males, suggesting that hormone signalling may impact mast cell recruitment. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of the male ovine mammary gland as a model for furthering our knowledge of postnatal male mammary biology.\nDisease progression modelling reveals heterogeneity in trajectories of Lewy-type alpha-synuclein pathology\nAuthors: Mastenbroek, S. E.; Vogel, J. W.; Collij, L. E.; Serrano, G. E.; Tremblay, C.; Young, A. L.; Arce, R. A.; Shill, H. A.; Driver-Dunckley, E. D.; Mehta, S. H.; Belden, C. M.; Atri, A.; Choudhury, P.; Barkhof, F.; Adler, C. H.; Ossenkoppele, R.; Beach, T. G.; Hansson, O.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.569878\nLewy body (LB) disorders, characterized by the aggregation of misfolded -synuclein proteins, exhibit notable clinical heterogeneity. This may be due to variations in accumulation patterns of LB neuropathology. By applying data-driven disease progression modelling to regional neuropathological LB density scores from 814 brain donors, we describe three inferred trajectories of LB pathology that were characterized by differing clinicopathological presentation and longitudinal antemortem clinical progression. Most donors (81.9%) showed earliest pathology in the olfactory bulb, followed by accumulation in either limbic (60.8%) or brainstem (21.1%) regions. The remaining donors (18.1%) exhibited the first abnormalities in brainstem regions. Early limbic pathology was associated with Alzheimers disease-associated characteristics. Meanwhile, brainstem-first pathology was associated with progressive motor impairment and substantial LB pathology outside of the brain. Our data provides evidence for heterogeneity in the temporal spread of LB pathology, possibly explaining some of the clinical disparities observed in LBDs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The specific biology of the male breast remains relatively unexplored in spite of the increasing global prevalence of male breast cancer. Delineation of the microenvironment of the male breast is restricted by the low availability of human samples and a lack of characterisation of appropriate animal models. Unlike the mouse, the male ovine gland persists postnatally. We suggest that the male ovine mammary gland constitutes a promising adjunctive model for the male human breast. In this study we evaluate the male ovine mammary gland microenvironment, comparing intact and neutered males. Assessment of the glandular histo-anatomy highlights the resemblance of the male gland to that of the neonatal female sheep and confirms the presence of rudimentary terminal duct lobular units. Irrespective of neutered status, cell proliferation in epithelial and stromal compartments is low in males, and cell proliferation in epithelial cells and in the intralobular stroma is significantly lower than in pubertal female sheep. Between 42% and 72% of the luminal mammary epithelial cells in the male gland express the androgen receptor, and expression is significantly reduced by neutering. Luminal epithelial cells within the intact and neutered male gland also express oestrogen receptor alpha, but minimal progesterone receptor expression is observed. The distrubution of mammary leukocytes within the ducts and stroma is similar in the female mammary gland of sheep and other species. Both macrophages and T lymphocytes are intercalated in the epithelial bilayer and are more abundant in the intralobular stroma than the interlobular stroma, suggesting that they may have a protective immunological function within the vestigial glandular tissue of the male sheep. Mast cells are also observed within the stroma. These cells cluster nearer the glandular tissue and are frequently located adjacent to blood vessels. The abundance of mast cells is significantly higher in intact males compared to neutered males, suggesting that hormone signalling may impact mast cell recruitment. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of the male ovine mammary gland as a model for furthering our knowledge of postnatal male mammary biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lewy body (LB) disorders, characterized by the aggregation of misfolded -synuclein proteins, exhibit notable clinical heterogeneity. This may be due to variations in accumulation patterns of LB neuropathology. By applying data-driven disease progression modelling to regional neuropathological LB density scores from 814 brain donors, we describe three inferred trajectories of LB pathology that were characterized by differing clinicopathological presentation and longitudinal antemortem clinical progression. Most donors (81.9%) showed earliest pathology in the olfactory bulb, followed by accumulation in either limbic (60.8%) or brainstem (21.1%) regions. The remaining donors (18.1%) exhibited the first abnormalities in brainstem regions. Early limbic pathology was associated with Alzheimers disease-associated characteristics. Meanwhile, brainstem-first pathology was associated with progressive motor impairment and substantial LB pathology outside of the brain. Our data provides evidence for heterogeneity in the temporal spread of LB pathology, possibly explaining some of the clinical disparities observed in LBDs.</p>
