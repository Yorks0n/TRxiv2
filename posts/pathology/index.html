Cumulative evidence points to long-term effects of COVID-19 such as cardiovascular and cognitive disorders diagnosed in patients even after the recovery period. In particular, micrometer-sized blood clots and hyperactivated platelets have been identified as potential indicators of long COVID. Here we resolve individual microclot structures in platelet-rich plasma of donors with different subphenotypes of COVID-19 in a label-free manner, using 3D digital holo-tomographic microscopy (DHTM). Based on 3D refractive index (RI) tomograms, the size, dry mass, and prevalence of microclot composites were quantified and then parametrically differentiated from fibrin-rich microclots and platelet aggregates in the plasma of COVID-19 donors. Importantly, fewer microclots and platelet aggregates were detected in the plasma of healthy controls when compared to COVID-19 donors. Our work highlights the utility of integrating DHTM in clinical settings that may allow the detection of individuals at risk of developing microvascular thrombotic disorders and for monitoring the efficiency of prescribed treatments by screening plasma samples.\nCharacterizing the phenotypic and genetic structure of psychopathology in UK Biobank\nAuthors: Williams, C. M.; Peyre, H.; Wolfram, T.; Lee, Y. H.; Ge, T.; Smoller, J. W.; Mallard, T. T.; Ramus, F.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295086\nMental conditions exhibit a higher-order transdiagnostic factor structure which helps to explain the widespread comorbidity observed in psychopathology. However, the phenotypic and genetic structures of psychopathology may differ, raising questions about the validity and utility of these factors. Here, we study the phenotypic and genetic factor structures of ten psychiatric conditions using UK Biobank and public genomic data. Although the factor structure of psychopathology was generally genetically and phenotypically consistent, conditions related to externalizing (e.g., alcohol use disorder) and compulsivity (e.g., eating disorders) exhibited cross-level disparities in their relationships with other conditions, plausibly due to environmental influences. Domain-level factors, especially thought disorder and internalizing factors, were more informative than a general psychopathology factor in genome-wide association and polygenic index analyses. Collectively, our findings enhance the understanding of comorbidity and shared etiology, highlight the intricate interplay between genes and environment, and offer guidance for psychiatric research using polygenic indices.\nLipid network of plasma extracellular vesicles reveals sex-based differences in the lipidomic profile from patients with alcohol use disorder\nAuthors: Perpina-Clerigues, C.; Mellado, S.; Galiana-Rosello, C.; Fernandez-Regueras, M.; Marcos, M.; Garcia-Garcia, F.; Pascual, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557479\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, and the consumption of this substance is considered one of the main causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Lipids play a crucial functional role in cell membranes, however little is known about the role of lipids containing extracellular vesicles (EVs), as regulatory molecules and biomarkers. In this study, a highly sensitive lipidomic strategy is employed to characterize plasma EV lipid species from individuals with AUD, to evaluate differential functional roles and enzymatic activity networks to improve the knowledge of lipid metabolism in the alcohol consumption. Plasma EV lipids from female and male patients with AUD and healthy individuals were analyzed to obtain lipid differential abundance, as well as biological interpretation of LINEX2 lipidomics data, evaluating enzymatic dysregulation through an enrichment algorithm. Our results showed for the first time that females with AUD exhibit greater substrate-product changes in LPC and PC lipids, as well as phospholipases and acyltransferases activity, potentially linked to cancer progression and neuroinflammation. Conversely, males with AUD showed dysregulation in Cer and SM lipid, involving sphingomyelinases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, and sphingomyelin synthase, which could be related with hepatotoxicity. Notably, females with AUD showed LION-terms associated with \"positive intrinsic curvature\", while males exhibited \"negative intrinsic curvature, contributing to vesicle fusion processes. These methodological developments allow a better understanding of lipid metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms, which contributes not only to identify novel lipid targets, but also the discovery of sex-specific clinical biomarkers in the AUD.\nNeuronal SNCA transcription during Lewy body formation\nAuthors: Kon, T.; Forrest, S. L.; Lee, S.; Martinez Valbuena, I.; Li, J.; Nassir, N.; Uddin, M. J.; Lang, A. E.; Kovacs, G. G.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553427\nBackgroundMisfolded -synuclein (-syn) is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease (LBD) based on considerable evidence including a gene-dosage effect observed in relation to point mutations and multiplication of SNCA in familial Parkinsons disease. A contradictory concept proposes early loss of the physiological -syn as the major driver of neurodegeneration. There is a paucity of data on SNCA transcripts in various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies. MethodsSNCA transcripts in neurons without and with various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies in the substantia nigra and amygdala in LBD (n = 5) were evaluated using RNAscope combined with immunofluorescence for disease-associated -syn. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate cell-type specific SNCA expression in non-diseased frontal cortex (n = 3). ResultsSNCA transcripts in neurons with punctate -syn immunoreactivity were preserved both in the substantia nigra and amygdala but were reduced in neurons with compact -syn inclusions. Only single SNCA transcripts were detected in astrocytes with or without -syn immunoreactivity in the amygdala. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and homeostatic microglia expressed SNCA transcripts, while expression was largely absent in astrocytes and microglia. ConclusionsThe preserved cellular SNCA expression in the more abundant non-Lewy body type -syn cytopathologies provides a pool for local protein production that can aggregate and serve as a seed for misfolded -syn. Successful segregation of disease-associated -syn is associated with the exhaustion of SNCA production in the terminal cytopathology, the Lewy body. Our observations support a therapeutic strategy incorporating a finely tuned dual approach targeting the elimination of misfolded -syn along with the reduction of the SNCA transcription to avoid feeding of pathological -syn seeding.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, and the consumption of this substance is considered one of the main causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Lipids play a crucial functional role in cell membranes, however little is known about the role of lipids containing extracellular vesicles (EVs), as regulatory molecules and biomarkers. In this study, a highly sensitive lipidomic strategy is employed to characterize plasma EV lipid species from individuals with AUD, to evaluate differential functional roles and enzymatic activity networks to improve the knowledge of lipid metabolism in the alcohol consumption. Plasma EV lipids from female and male patients with AUD and healthy individuals were analyzed to obtain lipid differential abundance, as well as biological interpretation of LINEX2 lipidomics data, evaluating enzymatic dysregulation through an enrichment algorithm. Our results showed for the first time that females with AUD exhibit greater substrate-product changes in LPC and PC lipids, as well as phospholipases and acyltransferases activity, potentially linked to cancer progression and neuroinflammation. Conversely, males with AUD showed dysregulation in Cer and SM lipid, involving sphingomyelinases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, and sphingomyelin synthase, which could be related with hepatotoxicity. Notably, females with AUD showed LION-terms associated with &#34;positive intrinsic curvature&#34;, while males exhibited &#34;negative intrinsic curvature, contributing to vesicle fusion processes. These methodological developments allow a better understanding of lipid metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms, which contributes not only to identify novel lipid targets, but also the discovery of sex-specific clinical biomarkers in the AUD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMisfolded -synuclein (-syn) is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease (LBD) based on considerable evidence including a gene-dosage effect observed in relation to point mutations and multiplication of SNCA in familial Parkinsons disease. A contradictory concept proposes early loss of the physiological -syn as the major driver of neurodegeneration. There is a paucity of data on SNCA transcripts in various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies.

MethodsSNCA transcripts in neurons without and with various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies in the substantia nigra and amygdala in LBD (n = 5) were evaluated using RNAscope combined with immunofluorescence for disease-associated -syn. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate cell-type specific SNCA expression in non-diseased frontal cortex (n = 3).

ResultsSNCA transcripts in neurons with punctate -syn immunoreactivity were preserved both in the substantia nigra and amygdala but were reduced in neurons with compact -syn inclusions. Only single SNCA transcripts were detected in astrocytes with or without -syn immunoreactivity in the amygdala. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and homeostatic microglia expressed SNCA transcripts, while expression was largely absent in astrocytes and microglia.

ConclusionsThe preserved cellular SNCA expression in the more abundant non-Lewy body type -syn cytopathologies provides a pool for local protein production that can aggregate and serve as a seed for misfolded -syn. Successful segregation of disease-associated -syn is associated with the exhaustion of SNCA production in the terminal cytopathology, the Lewy body. Our observations support a therapeutic strategy incorporating a finely tuned dual approach targeting the elimination of misfolded -syn along with the reduction of the SNCA transcription to avoid feeding of pathological -syn seeding.</p>
