We previously identified CD9hi adipose tissue progenitors as the main drivers of vWAT fibrosis in mice and humans. However, how their functions are controlled, especially by macrophages, remains largely unknown. We found that obesity-elicited monocyte-derived macrophages (obeMac) accumulation was considerably elevated in mice prone to obesity-induced vWAT fibrosis. Limiting obeMac build-up decreased the numbers and fibrogenic activation of CD9hi progenitors, leading to decreased vWAT fibrosis and improved glucose homeostasis. In patients with obesity, we identified macrophages similar to mouse obeMacs that were associated with accumulation of CD9hi progenitors in the vWAT and loss of glycemic control. Finally, intercellular communication analysis identified mediators produced by obeMacs that control the fibrogenic potential of CD9hi progenitors. Together, we uncovered an obeMac-CD9hi progenitors axis controlling vWAT fibrosis and dysfunction.\nNEW INSIGHTS INTO THE HEPATIC IRON PHENOTYPE OF BMP6 KNOCKOUT MICE\nAuthors: BESSON, C.; WILLEMETZ, A.; LATOUR, C.; ROBERT, L.; COPPIN, H.; ROTH, M.-P.; CANONNE-HERGAUX, F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559941\nObjective: Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and Methods: Livers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. Results: In Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. Conclusions: Unregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporter's iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.\nThe Intricate Relationship of G-Quadruplexes and Pathogenicity Islands: A Window into Bacterial Pathogenicity\nAuthors: Lyu, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548048\nThe dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4s and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in infectious diseases.\nLoss of embryonically-derived Kupffer cells during hypercholesterolemia accelerates atherosclerosis development\nAuthors: Fima, R.; Dussaud, S.; Benbida, C.; Blanchet, M.; Lanthiez, F.; Poupel, L.; Brambilla, C.; Moreau, M.; Boissonnas, A.; Gautier, E.; Huby, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559586\nHypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases. The liver plays a key role in the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels and hosts a large population of tissue-resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs). KCs are located in the hepatic sinusoids where they ensure key functions including blood immune surveillance. However, how KCs homeostasis is affected by the build-up of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins that occurs in the circulation during hypercholesterolemia remains unknown. Here, we found that embryo-derived KCs (EmKCs) accumulated large amounts of lipoprotein- derived cholesterol, in part through the scavenger receptor CD36, and massively expanded early after the induction of hypercholesterolemia. After this rapid adaptive response, EmKCs exhibited mitochondrial oxidative stress and their numbers gradually diminished while monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) with reduced cholesterol-loading capacities seeded the KC pool. Decreased proportion of EmKCs in the KC pool enhanced liver cholesterol content and exacerbated hypercholesterolemia, leading to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development. Together, our data reveal that KC homeostasis is perturbed during hypercholesterolemia, which in turn alters the control of plasma cholesterol levels and increases atherosclerosis.\nNative ultrastructure of fresh human brain vitrified directly from autopsy revealed by cryo-electron tomography with cryo-plasma focused ion beam milling\nAuthors: Creekmore, B. C.; Kixmoeller, K.; Black, B. E.; Lee, E. B.; Chang, Y.-W.\nScore: 27.3, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557623\nUltrastructure of human brain tissue has traditionally been examined using electron microscopy (EM) following chemical fixation, staining, and mechanical sectioning, which limit attainable resolution and introduce artifacts. Alternatively, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offers the potential to image unfixed cellular samples at higher resolution while preserving their native structures, but it requires samples to be frozen free from crystalline ice and thin enough to image via transmission EM. Due to these requirements, cryo-ET has yet to be employed to investigate the native ultrastructure of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue. Here we present a method for generating lamellae in human brain tissue obtained at time of autopsy that can be imaged via cryo-ET. We vitrify the tissue directly on cryo-EM grids via plunge-freezing, as opposed to high pressure freezing which is generally used for thick samples. Following vitrification, we use xenon plasma focused ion beam (FIB) milling to generate lamellae directly on-grid. In comparison to gallium FIB, which is commonly used for biological samples, xenon plasma FIB is powerful enough to efficiently mill large volume samples, such as human brain tissue. Additionally, our approach allows for lamellae to be generated at variable depth inside the tissue as opposed to being limited to starting at the surface of the tissue. Lamellae generated in Alzheimers disease brain tissue and imaged by cryo-ET reveal intact subcellular structures including components of autophagy and potential tau fibrils. Furthermore, we visualize myelin revealing intact compact myelin and functional cytoplasmic expansions such as cytoplasmic channels and the inner tongue. From these images we also measure the dimensions of myelin membranes, providing insight into how myelin basic protein forces out oligodendrocyte cytoplasm to form compact myelin and tightly links intracellular polar head groups of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane. This approach provides a first view of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue prepared by cryo-plasma FIB milling and imaged at high resolution by cryo-ET.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and Methods: Livers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. Results: In Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. Conclusions: Unregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporter&#39;s iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4s and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in infectious diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases. The liver plays a key role in the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels and hosts a large population of tissue-resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs). KCs are located in the hepatic sinusoids where they ensure key functions including blood immune surveillance. However, how KCs homeostasis is affected by the build-up of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins that occurs in the circulation during hypercholesterolemia remains unknown. Here, we found that embryo-derived KCs (EmKCs) accumulated large amounts of lipoprotein- derived cholesterol, in part through the scavenger receptor CD36, and massively expanded early after the induction of hypercholesterolemia. After this rapid adaptive response, EmKCs exhibited mitochondrial oxidative stress and their numbers gradually diminished while monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) with reduced cholesterol-loading capacities seeded the KC pool. Decreased proportion of EmKCs in the KC pool enhanced liver cholesterol content and exacerbated hypercholesterolemia, leading to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development. Together, our data reveal that KC homeostasis is perturbed during hypercholesterolemia, which in turn alters the control of plasma cholesterol levels and increases atherosclerosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ultrastructure of human brain tissue has traditionally been examined using electron microscopy (EM) following chemical fixation, staining, and mechanical sectioning, which limit attainable resolution and introduce artifacts. Alternatively, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offers the potential to image unfixed cellular samples at higher resolution while preserving their native structures, but it requires samples to be frozen free from crystalline ice and thin enough to image via transmission EM. Due to these requirements, cryo-ET has yet to be employed to investigate the native ultrastructure of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue. Here we present a method for generating lamellae in human brain tissue obtained at time of autopsy that can be imaged via cryo-ET. We vitrify the tissue directly on cryo-EM grids via plunge-freezing, as opposed to high pressure freezing which is generally used for thick samples. Following vitrification, we use xenon plasma focused ion beam (FIB) milling to generate lamellae directly on-grid. In comparison to gallium FIB, which is commonly used for biological samples, xenon plasma FIB is powerful enough to efficiently mill large volume samples, such as human brain tissue. Additionally, our approach allows for lamellae to be generated at variable depth inside the tissue as opposed to being limited to starting at the surface of the tissue. Lamellae generated in Alzheimers disease brain tissue and imaged by cryo-ET reveal intact subcellular structures including components of autophagy and potential tau fibrils. Furthermore, we visualize myelin revealing intact compact myelin and functional cytoplasmic expansions such as cytoplasmic channels and the inner tongue. From these images we also measure the dimensions of myelin membranes, providing insight into how myelin basic protein forces out oligodendrocyte cytoplasm to form compact myelin and tightly links intracellular polar head groups of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane. This approach provides a first view of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue prepared by cryo-plasma FIB milling and imaged at high resolution by cryo-ET.</p>
