B.; Pekosz, A.; Villano, J.; Kim, D.-H.; O'Rourke, B.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574280\nBackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nIntegrated histopathology, spatial and single cell transcriptomics resolve cellular drivers of early and late alveolar damage in COVID-19\nAuthors: Lee, J. T. H.; Barnett, S. N.; Roberts, K.; Ashwin, H.; Milross, L.; Cho, J.-W.; Huseynov, A.; Woodhams, B.; Aivazidis, A.; Li, T.; Majo, J.; Guerrero, P. C.; Lee, M.; Miranda, A. M. A.; Jablonska, Z.; Arena, V.; Hanley, B.; Osborn, M.; Uhlmann, V.; Xu, X.-N.; McLean, G. R.; Teichmann, S. A.; Randi, A. M.; Filby, A.; Kaye, P. M.; Fisher, A. J.; Hemberg, M.; Noseda, M.; Bayraktar, O. A.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572494\nThe most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.\nCognitive and molecular characterization of the Ts66Yah murine model of Down syndrome: deepening on hippocampal changes associated with genotype and aging.\nAuthors: Lanzillotta, C.; Rataj-Baniowska, M.; Prestia, F.; Sette, C.; Nalesso, V.; Perluigi, M.; Barone, E.; Duchon, A.; Tramutola, A.; Herault, Y.; Di Domenico, F.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573811\nDown syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.\nDeletion of absent in melanoma (AIM) 2 gene alters bone morphology\nAuthors: Gong, Z.; Dixit, M.; Poudel, S. B.; Yildirim, G.; Yakar, S.; Muzumdar, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574199\nAbsent in Melanoma (AIM) 2 is a gene that is induced by interferon and acts as a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded (ds) DNA. It forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18. Our previous research demonstrated that mice lacking AIM2 exhibit spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of AIM2 gene deletion on bone structure in adult and aged mice. Utilizing micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), we discovered that female mice lacking AIM2 showed an increase in the total cross-sectional area at 5 months of age, accompanied by an increase in cortical thickness in the mid-diaphysis of the femur at both 5 and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, the cortical bone mineral density (BMD) significantly decreased in AIM2 null females compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In AIM2 null mice, both trabecular bone volume and BMD at the distal metaphysis of the femur significantly decreased at 5 and 15 months of age. Similarly, micro-CT analysis of the L4 vertebra revealed significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and BMD in aged AIM2 null females compared to WT mice. Histological examination of femurs from aged mice demonstrated increased bone marrow adiposity in AIM2 null mice, accompanied by a significant increase in CD45-/CD31-/Sca1+/Pdgfa+ adipose progenitor cells, and a decrease in the ratio of CD31-/CD31+ osteogenic progenitor cells, as determined by flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Our findings suggest that AIM2 deficiency affects bone health by promoting adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and inducing a pro-inflammatory environment, potentially contributing to the decreased bone mineral density.\nNeuropathological assessment of the olfactory bulb and tract in individuals with COVID-19\nAuthors: Lengacher, N. A.; Tomlinson, J. J.; Jochum, A.-K.; Franz, J.; Hasan Ali, O.; Flatz, L.; Jochum, W.; Penninger, J.; aSCENT-PD Investigators, ; Stadelmann-Nessler, C.; Woulfe, J. M.; Schlossmacher, M. G.\nScore: 23.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572180\nThe majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19+ patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19+ patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19+ patients.\nInhibiting YAP1 reduced abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by suppressing adventitial fibroblast phenotype transformation and migration\nAuthors: Xie, C.; Hu, Y.; Yin, Z.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573973\nBACKGROUNDThe adventitial fibroblast (AF) is the most abundant cell in the vascular adventitia, a few studies had confirmed that AF contributed to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development; YAP1 involved in several vascular diseases by promoting AF transformed to myofibroblast, the role of YAP1 in AAA is not clear yet. This study aims to determine whether YAP1 play a role in AAA process by regulating AF function. METHODSElastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model were used in this study, we applied YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in vivo to explore the role of YAP1 in AAA information; in vitro, Verteporfin and YAP1-siRNA were used to intervened TGF-{beta}1 induced fibroblasts phenotype transformation and migration model. RESULTSAt first, we use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) to compare the expression of YAP1 in aneurysm tissues of AAA patients with normal adjacent vascular tissues, we found that the expression of YAP1 in AAA tissues was significantly increased, and YAP1 mainly increased in adventitia. YAP1 also upregulated in elastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model. Then, we diminished YAP1 function with YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in above mice AAA model, AAA incident rate was remarkably declined, and the collagen deposition in the adventitia was alleviated obviously. Afterwards, we studied the effect of YAP1 on the function of AF, we found that the process of AF transforming to myofibroblast and migration were almost completely eliminated after inhibiting YAP1 expression. CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrated that YAP1 may play a key role in AAA development, inhibiting YAP1 significantly reduced AAA formation through suppressed the process of AF transformed to myofibroblast and migration.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Down syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Absent in Melanoma (AIM) 2 is a gene that is induced by interferon and acts as a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded (ds) DNA. It forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18. Our previous research demonstrated that mice lacking AIM2 exhibit spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of AIM2 gene deletion on bone structure in adult and aged mice. Utilizing micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), we discovered that female mice lacking AIM2 showed an increase in the total cross-sectional area at 5 months of age, accompanied by an increase in cortical thickness in the mid-diaphysis of the femur at both 5 and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, the cortical bone mineral density (BMD) significantly decreased in AIM2 null females compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In AIM2 null mice, both trabecular bone volume and BMD at the distal metaphysis of the femur significantly decreased at 5 and 15 months of age. Similarly, micro-CT analysis of the L4 vertebra revealed significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and BMD in aged AIM2 null females compared to WT mice. Histological examination of femurs from aged mice demonstrated increased bone marrow adiposity in AIM2 null mice, accompanied by a significant increase in CD45-/CD31-/Sca1&#43;/Pdgfa&#43; adipose progenitor cells, and a decrease in the ratio of CD31-/CD31&#43; osteogenic progenitor cells, as determined by flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Our findings suggest that AIM2 deficiency affects bone health by promoting adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and inducing a pro-inflammatory environment, potentially contributing to the decreased bone mineral density.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19&#43; patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19&#43; patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19&#43; patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDThe adventitial fibroblast (AF) is the most abundant cell in the vascular adventitia, a few studies had confirmed that AF contributed to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development; YAP1 involved in several vascular diseases by promoting AF transformed to myofibroblast, the role of YAP1 in AAA is not clear yet. This study aims to determine whether YAP1 play a role in AAA process by regulating AF function.

METHODSElastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model were used in this study, we applied YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in vivo to explore the role of YAP1 in AAA information; in vitro, Verteporfin and YAP1-siRNA were used to intervened TGF-{beta}1 induced fibroblasts phenotype transformation and migration model.

RESULTSAt first, we use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) to compare the expression of YAP1 in aneurysm tissues of AAA patients with normal adjacent vascular tissues, we found that the expression of YAP1 in AAA tissues was significantly increased, and YAP1 mainly increased in adventitia. YAP1 also upregulated in elastase-induced and Cacl2-induced mice AAA model. Then, we diminished YAP1 function with YAP1 inhibitor-Verteporfin in above mice AAA model, AAA incident rate was remarkably declined, and the collagen deposition in the adventitia was alleviated obviously. Afterwards, we studied the effect of YAP1 on the function of AF, we found that the process of AF transforming to myofibroblast and migration were almost completely eliminated after inhibiting YAP1 expression.

CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrated that YAP1 may play a key role in AAA development, inhibiting YAP1 significantly reduced AAA formation through suppressed the process of AF transformed to myofibroblast and migration.</p>
