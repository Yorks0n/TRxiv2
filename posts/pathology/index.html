  "articleBody": " A drug cocktail of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate enhances resilience to features of early-stage Alzheimer's disease in aging mice\nAuthors: Wezeman, J.; Darvas, M.; Postupna, N.; Klug, J.; Mangalindan, R. S.; Keely, A.; Nguyen, K.; Johnson, C.; Rosenfeld, M.; Ladiges, W.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577437\nThe process of aging is defined by the breakdown of critical maintenance pathways leading to an accumulation of damage and its associated phenotypes. Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice. To test the ability of this drug cocktail to impact Alzheimers disease (AD), an adeno-associated-viral vector model of AD was created. Mice were fed the drug cocktail 2 months prior to injection and allowed 3 months for phenotypic development. Cognitive phenotypes were evaluated through a spatial navigation learning task. To quantify neuropathology, immunohistochemistry was performed for AD proteins and pathways of aging. Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.\nMulti-V-Stain: Multiplexed Virtual Staining of Histopathology Whole-Slide Images\nAuthors: Andani, S.; Chen, B.; Ficek-Pascual, J.; Heinke, S.; Casanova, R.; Sobottka, B.; Bodenmiller, B.; The Tumor Profiler Consortium, ; Kölzer, V. H.; Rätsch, G.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301803\nPathological assessment of Hematoxylin \u0026 Eosin (H\u0026E) stained tissue samples is a well-established clinical routine for cancer diagnosis. While providing rich morphological data, it lacks information on protein expression patterns which is crucial for cancer prognosis and treatment recommendations. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) excels in highly multiplexed protein profiling but faces challenges like high operational cost and a restrictive focus on small Regions-of-Interest. Addressing this, we introduce Multi-V-Stain, a novel image-to-image translation method for multiplexed IMC virtual staining. Our method effectively utilizes the rich morphological features from H\u0026E images to predict multiplexed protein expressions at a Whole-Slide Image level. In evaluations using an in-house melanoma dataset, Multi-V-Stain consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and biological relevance of the generated stains.\nLoss of TIM4-Dependent Efferocytosis in Kupffer CellsPromotes Liver Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis\nAuthors: Shi, H.; Wang, X.; Gerlach, B.; Yurdagul, A.; Moore, M.; Mirshahi, F.; Ronzoni, L.; Sanyal, A.; Valenti, L.; Lin, C.-S.; Tabas, I.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578023\nBackground and aims: Hepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the fate of apoptotic hepatocytes in NASH is poorly understood. Herein we explore the hypothesis that impaired TIM4-mediated clearance of dead hepatocytes by liver macrophages (efferocytosis) is impaired in NASH and drives the progression to liver fibrosis. Methods: Kupffer cell (KC)-TIM4 expression and efferocytosis were assayed in normal and NASH liver from humans and diet-induced NASH mice. The engulfment of human and mouse apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs was assayed ex vivo. Causation was assessed in NASH mice using anti-TIM4 antibodies, KC-TIM4-knockout, or inducible KC-TIM4 expression, with analyses focused on efferocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and liver fibrosis. Results: In human and mouse NASH liver, apoptotic hepatocytes accumulated and was associated with the loss of the KC efferocytosis receptor TIM4. Anti-TIM4 inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs ex vivo, and anti-TIM4 administration to early NASH mice worsened liver macrophage efferocytosis and accelerated the progression to fibrotic NASH. A similar result was obtained by genetically deleting TIM4 in KCs in NASH mice. Most importantly, genetic restoration of macrophage TIM4 in NASH mice enhanced the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and decreased liver fibrosis. Conclusions: The loss of macrophage TIM4 that occurs during NASH progression impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages, which subsequently promotes the progression to fibrotic NASH. This pathogenic sequence of events can be prevented by restoring macrophage TIM4, suggesting that future therapeutic approaches designed to boost TIM4 expression in liver macrophages could represent a novel strategy to prevent fibrotic NASH progression.\nXKidneyOnco: An Explainable Framework to Classify Renal Oncocytoma and Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma with a Small Sample Size\nAuthors: Javaheri, T.; Heidari, S.; Yang, X.; Yerra, S.; Seidi, K.; Setayesh, T.; Zhang, G.; Chitkushev, L.; Salar, S. S.; Sayeeduddin, Z.; Zarrin-Khameh, N.; Gharib, M. H.; Castro, P.; Haeri, M.; Rawassizadeh, R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576782\nRenal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma are two kidney cancer types that present a diagnostic challenge to pathologists and other clinicians due to their microscopic similarities. While RO is a benign renal neoplasm, ChRCC is considered malignant. Therefore, the differentiation between the two is crucial. In this study, we introduce an explainable framework to accurately differentiate ChRCC from RO, histologically. Our approach examined H\u0026E-stained images of 656 ChRCC and 720 RO, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%, the sensitivity of 87%, and 100% specificity for explainable AI, which either outperforms or operate on par with convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Besides, we enrolled 44 pathology experts (including pathologists and pathology trainees) to differentiate the two tumors. The average accuracy of pathologists was 73%, which is 15.2% lower than our framework. These results indicate that the combination of human expert along with explainable AI achieve higher accuracy in differentiating the two tumors, while it reduces the workload of experts and offers the desired explainability for the medical experts.\nInnate Immune Activation and Mitochondrial ROS Invoke Persistent Cardiac Conduction System Dysfunction after COVID-19\nAuthors: Ashok, D.; Liu, T.; Criscione, J.; Prakash, M.; Kim, B.; Chow, J.; Craney, M.; Papanicolaou, K.; Sidor, A.; Foster, D. B.; Pekosz, A.; Villano, J.; Kim, D.-H.; O'Rourke, B.\nScore: 34.9, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574280\nBackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nThe SUbventral-Gland master Regulator (SUGR) of nematode virulence\nAuthors: Pellegrin, C.; Damm, A.; Sperling, A. L.; Molloy, B.; Shin, D. S.; Long, J.; Brett, P.; Bravo, A. D.-T.; Lynch, S. J.; Senatori, B.; Vieira, P.; Mejias, J.; Kumar, A.; Masonbrink, R. E.; Maier, T. R.; Baum, T. J.; Eves-van den Akker, S.\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576598\nAll pathogens must tailor their gene expression to their environment. Therefore, targeting host:parasite biology that regulates these changes in gene expression could open up routes to pathogen control. Here, we show that in the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii, host signals (termed effectostimulins) within plant roots activate the master regulator sugr1. SUGR1, then, directly binds effector promoters, and orchestrates their production. Effector production, in turn, facilitates host entry, releasing more effectostimulins. These data show that gene expression during the very earliest stages of parasitism is defined by a feed forward loop for host entry. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking SUGR1 blocks parasitism, underlining the SUGR1 signalling cascade as a valuable target for crop protection. Given that nematodes also parasitise humans and other animals, the potential impact is broad: disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.

Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice.

Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathological assessment of Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue samples is a well-established clinical routine for cancer diagnosis. While providing rich morphological data, it lacks information on protein expression patterns which is crucial for cancer prognosis and treatment recommendations. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) excels in highly multiplexed protein profiling but faces challenges like high operational cost and a restrictive focus on small Regions-of-Interest. Addressing this, we introduce Multi-V-Stain, a novel image-to-image translation method for multiplexed IMC virtual staining. Our method effectively utilizes the rich morphological features from H&amp;E images to predict multiplexed protein expressions at a Whole-Slide Image level. In evaluations using an in-house melanoma dataset, Multi-V-Stain consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and biological relevance of the generated stains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aims: Hepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the fate of apoptotic hepatocytes in NASH is poorly understood. Herein we explore the hypothesis that impaired TIM4-mediated clearance of dead hepatocytes by liver macrophages (efferocytosis) is impaired in NASH and drives the progression to liver fibrosis. Methods: Kupffer cell (KC)-TIM4 expression and efferocytosis were assayed in normal and NASH liver from humans and diet-induced NASH mice. The engulfment of human and mouse apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs was assayed ex vivo. Causation was assessed in NASH mice using anti-TIM4 antibodies, KC-TIM4-knockout, or inducible KC-TIM4 expression, with analyses focused on efferocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and liver fibrosis. Results: In human and mouse NASH liver, apoptotic hepatocytes accumulated and was associated with the loss of the KC efferocytosis receptor TIM4. Anti-TIM4 inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes by primary human and mouse liver KCs ex vivo, and anti-TIM4 administration to early NASH mice worsened liver macrophage efferocytosis and accelerated the progression to fibrotic NASH. A similar result was obtained by genetically deleting TIM4 in KCs in NASH mice. Most importantly, genetic restoration of macrophage TIM4 in NASH mice enhanced the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages and decreased liver fibrosis. Conclusions: The loss of macrophage TIM4 that occurs during NASH progression impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes by liver macrophages, which subsequently promotes the progression to fibrotic NASH. This pathogenic sequence of events can be prevented by restoring macrophage TIM4, suggesting that future therapeutic approaches designed to boost TIM4 expression in liver macrophages could represent a novel strategy to prevent fibrotic NASH progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Renal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma are two kidney cancer types that present a diagnostic challenge to pathologists and other clinicians due to their microscopic similarities. While RO is a benign renal neoplasm, ChRCC is considered malignant. Therefore, the differentiation between the two is crucial. In this study, we introduce an explainable framework to accurately differentiate ChRCC from RO, histologically. Our approach examined H&amp;E-stained images of 656 ChRCC and 720 RO, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%, the sensitivity of 87%, and 100% specificity for explainable AI, which either outperforms or operate on par with convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

Besides, we enrolled 44 pathology experts (including pathologists and pathology trainees) to differentiate the two tumors. The average accuracy of pathologists was 73%, which is 15.2% lower than our framework.

These results indicate that the combination of human expert along with explainable AI achieve higher accuracy in differentiating the two tumors, while it reduces the workload of experts and offers the desired explainability for the medical experts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All pathogens must tailor their gene expression to their environment. Therefore, targeting host:parasite biology that regulates these changes in gene expression could open up routes to pathogen control. Here, we show that in the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii, host signals (termed effectostimulins) within plant roots activate the master regulator sugr1. SUGR1, then, directly binds effector promoters, and orchestrates their production. Effector production, in turn, facilitates host entry, releasing more effectostimulins. These data show that gene expression during the very earliest stages of parasitism is defined by a feed forward loop for host entry. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking SUGR1 blocks parasitism, underlining the SUGR1 signalling cascade as a valuable target for crop protection. Given that nematodes also parasitise humans and other animals, the potential impact is broad: disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.
