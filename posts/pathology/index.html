This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nComparative analysis of kidney transplantation modeled using precision-cut kidney slices and kidney transplantation in pigs\nAuthors: Moor, M. B.; Nordström, J.; Burmakin, M.; Raki, M.; Al-Saad, S.; Nowak, G.; Wennberg, L.; Patrakka, J.; Olauson, H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575664\nKidney transplants are at risk for so far unavoidable ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several experimental kidney transplantation models are available to study this injury, but all have their own limitations. Here, we describe precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) as a novel model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in comparison with pig and human kidney transplantation. Following bilateral nephrectomy in pigs, we applied warm ischemia (1h), cold ischemia (20h) and a reperfusion period (4h) to one whole kidney undergoing transplantation to a recipient pig and, in parallel, established PCKS undergoing ischemia and modeled reperfusion. Histopathological assessment revealed the presence of some but not all morphological features of tubular injury in PCKS as seen in pig kidney transplantation. RNAseq demonstrated that the majority of changes occurred after reperfusion only, with a partial overlap between PCKS and kidney transplantation, with some differences in transcriptional response attributable to systemic inflammatory responses and immune cell migration. Comparison of PCKS and pig kidney transplantation with RNAseq data from human kidney biopsies by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that both PCKS and pig kidney transplantation reproduced the post-reperfusion pattern of human kidney transplantation. In contrast, only post-cold ischemia PCKS and pig kidney partially resembled the gene set of human acute kidney injury. Overall, the present study established that a PCKS protocol can model kidney transplantation and its reperfusion-related damage on a histological and a transcriptomic level. PCKS may thus expand the toolbox for developing novel therapeutic strategies against ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nDeciphering the Molecular Mechanism of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 through Comorbidity Network Analysis\nAuthors: Tian, L.; Wong, I. C. K.; Zhang, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575851\nIntroductionThe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 presents a significant health challenge in the post-pandemic world. Our study aims to analyze longitudinal electronic health records to determine the impact of COVID-19 on disease progression, provide molecular insights into these mechanisms, and identify associated biomarkers. MethodWe included 58,710 patients with COVID-19 records from 01/01/2020 to 31/08/2022 and at least one hospital admission before and after the acute phase of COVID-19 (28 days) as the treatment group. A healthy control group of 174,071 individuals was established for comparison using propensity score matching based on pre-existing diseases (before COVID-19). We built a comorbidity network using Pearson correlation coefficient differences between pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease in both groups. Disease-protein mapping and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed the impact of COVID-19 on disease trajectories through protein interactions in the human body. ResultsThe disparity in the weight of prevalent disease comorbidity patterns between the treatment and control groups highlights the impact of COVID-19. Certain specific comorbidity patterns show a more pronounced influence by COVID-19. For each comorbidity pattern, overlapping proteins directly associated with pre-existing diseases, post-infection diseases, and COVID-19 help to elucidate the biological mechanism of COVID-19s impact on each comorbidity pattern. Proteins essential for explaining the biological mechanism can be identified based on their weights. ConclusionDisease comorbidity associations influenced by COVID-19, as identified through longitudinal electronic health records and disease-protein mapping, can help elucidate the biological mechanisms of COVID-19, discover intervention methods, and decode the molecular basis of comorbidity associations. This analysis can also yield potential biomarkers and corresponding treatments for specific disease patterns. Ethical approvalEthical approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/HA HK West Cluster (UW20-556, UW21-149 and UW21-138). RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles up to Nov 30, 2022, with no language restrictions, using the terms \"Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19\" OR \"PASC\" OR \"Long COVID\" AND \"comorbidity\" OR \"multimorbidity\" OR \"co-morbidity\" OR \"multi-morbidity\". We found most related papers focus on the comorbidity or multimorbidity patterns among PASC. Some papers focus on the associations between specific diseases and PASC. However, no study investigated the biological mechanism of PASC from the perspective of comorbidity network. Added value of this studyThis study investigated the biological mechanism of PASC based on the comorbidity network including the impact of pre-existing diseases (diseases diagnosed within 730 days before COVID-19) on the development of PASC. We classified pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease (new diseases diagnosed in 28 days to 180 days after COVID-19) as comorbidity associations. Through a comparison of the frequency of comorbidity associations in health people group and patients with COVID-19 infection group, we identified comorbidity patterns that are significantly influenced by COVID-19 infection and constructed a comorbidity network comprising of 117 nodes (representing diseases) and 271 edges (representing comorbidity patterns). These comorbidity patterns suggest COVID-19 patients with these pre-existing diseases have higher risk for post-infection diseases. Through the analysis of the Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network and associations between diseases and proteins, we identified key proteins in the topological distance of each comorbidity pattern and important biological pathways by GO enrichment analysis. These proteins and biological pathways provide insights into the underlying biological mechanism of PASC. Implications of all the available evidenceThe identification of elevated-risk comorbidity patterns associated with COVID-19 infection is crucial for the effective allocation of medical resources, ensuring prompt care for those in greatest need. Furthermore, it facilitates the recovery process of patients from COVID-19, offering a roadmap for their path back to health. The key proteins identified in our study have the potential to serve as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention, thereby establishing a foundation for the development of new drugs and the repurposing of existing ones. Further research should focus on drug discovery and the development of drug recommendations for patients with COVID-19 infections.\nPolymeric nanoparticles delivery of AMPK activator 991 prevents its toxicity and improves muscle homeostasis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\nAuthors: Andreana, I.; Kneppers, A.; Ben Larbi, S.; Tifni, F.; Fessard, A.; Sidi-Boumedine, J.; Kryza, D.; Stella, B.; Bordes, C.; Arpicco, S.; Chevalier, Y.; Chazaud, B.; Mounier, R.; Lollo, G.; Juban, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575840\nMuscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), are caused by permanent muscle injuries leading to chronic inflammation. In that context, macrophages harbor an altered inflammatory profile that contributes to fibrosis through the secretion of the profibrotic cytokine TGF{beta}1. We previously showed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces TGF{beta}1 secretion by macrophages and improves muscle homeostasis and muscle force in a mouse model of DMD. This makes AMPK an attractive therapeutic target for treating chronic inflammation and fibrosis in DMD. However, potent direct AMPK activators like compound 991 show strong adverse effects in vivo, preventing their direct use. Here, we encapsulated 991 into biodegradable polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles for in vivo delivery, in an attempt to overcome toxicity issues. We show that 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles retained drug activity on fibrotic macrophages in vitro, by reducing their secretion of TGF{beta}1. In the D2-mdx pre-clinical DMD mouse model, intravenously injected PLGA nanoparticles reached gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles, which are the most affected muscles in this model. Chronic intravenous injections of 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles decreased inflammation in both muscles, which was associated with fibrosis reduction and increase in myofiber size and muscle mass in the gastrocnemius. No impact on blood cell counts and liver enzymes was observed. These results demonstrate that nanomedicine is an efficient strategy to deliver AMPK activators in vivo to target inflammation and improve the dystrophic muscle phenotype.\nImpact of Mesotherapy with Sodium Deoxycholate on Liver: Metabolic- and Sex-Specific Insights in Swiss mice\nAuthors: Goncalves, L. F.; Rosa, B. R.; Ramos, I. T. T.; Feder, J. B.; Messina, J. R. M.; Barreira, R. M.; Torres, V. M.; Simoes, V. L.; Paes-de-Almeida, E. C.; Fernandes-Santos, C.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576283\nBackground: Sodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions. Objective: To investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption. Methods: Female and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression. Results: Chronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups. Conclusion: DC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.\nCytoarchitecture of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster lungs by X-ray phase contrast tomography: imaging workflow and classification for drug testing\nAuthors: Reichmann, J.; Sarrazin, C.; Schmale, S.; Blaurock, C.; Balkema-Buschmann, A.; Schmitzer, B.; Salditt, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576083\nX-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. In this work, we present a workflow implemented at a laboratory CT setup, using semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification of lung tissue in an early screen of Covid-19 drug candidates. Different drugs were tested in a hamster model after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To make full use of the recorded high-throughput XPCT data, we then used morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing invaluable insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment.\nReduced intra-tendinous sliding in Achilles tendinopathy during active plantarflexion regardless of horizontal foot position\nAuthors: Lecompte, L.; Crouzier, M.; Bogaerts, S.; Scheys, L.; Vanwanseele, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574669\nThe Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons with the ability to slide relative to each other. As optimal intra-tendinous sliding is thought to reduce the overall stress in the tendon, alterations in sliding behavior could potentially play a role in the development of Achilles tendinopathy. The aims of this study were to investigate the difference in intra-tendinous sliding within the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions between asymptomatic controls and patients with Achilles tendinopathy and the effect of changing the horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding in both groups. 29 participants (13 Achilles tendinopathy, 16 controls) performed isometric plantarflexion contractions at 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), in toes-neutral, and at 30% MVC in toes-neutral, toes-in and toes-out positions during which ultrasound images were recorded. Intra-tendinous sliding was estimated as the superficial-to-middle and middle-to-deep relative displacement. Our results indicate that patients with Achilles tendinopathy present lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Regarding the horizontal foot position in both groups, the toes-out foot position resulted in increased sliding compared to both toes-neutral and toes-out foot position. We provided evidence that patients with Achilles tendinopathy show lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Since intra-tendinous sliding is a physiological feature of the Achilles tendon, the external foot position holds promise to increase sliding in patients with Achilles tendinopathy and promote healthy tendon behavior. Future research should investigate if implementing this external foot position in rehabilitation programs stimulates sliding within the Achilles tendon and improves clinical outcome.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kidney transplants are at risk for so far unavoidable ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several experimental kidney transplantation models are available to study this injury, but all have their own limitations. Here, we describe precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) as a novel model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in comparison with pig and human kidney transplantation.

Following bilateral nephrectomy in pigs, we applied warm ischemia (1h), cold ischemia (20h) and a reperfusion period (4h) to one whole kidney undergoing transplantation to a recipient pig and, in parallel, established PCKS undergoing ischemia and modeled reperfusion. Histopathological assessment revealed the presence of some but not all morphological features of tubular injury in PCKS as seen in pig kidney transplantation. RNAseq demonstrated that the majority of changes occurred after reperfusion only, with a partial overlap between PCKS and kidney transplantation, with some differences in transcriptional response attributable to systemic inflammatory responses and immune cell migration. Comparison of PCKS and pig kidney transplantation with RNAseq data from human kidney biopsies by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that both PCKS and pig kidney transplantation reproduced the post-reperfusion pattern of human kidney transplantation. In contrast, only post-cold ischemia PCKS and pig kidney partially resembled the gene set of human acute kidney injury.

Overall, the present study established that a PCKS protocol can model kidney transplantation and its reperfusion-related damage on a histological and a transcriptomic level. PCKS may thus expand the toolbox for developing novel therapeutic strategies against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 presents a significant health challenge in the post-pandemic world. Our study aims to analyze longitudinal electronic health records to determine the impact of COVID-19 on disease progression, provide molecular insights into these mechanisms, and identify associated biomarkers.

MethodWe included 58,710 patients with COVID-19 records from 01/01/2020 to 31/08/2022 and at least one hospital admission before and after the acute phase of COVID-19 (28 days) as the treatment group. A healthy control group of 174,071 individuals was established for comparison using propensity score matching based on pre-existing diseases (before COVID-19). We built a comorbidity network using Pearson correlation coefficient differences between pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease in both groups. Disease-protein mapping and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed the impact of COVID-19 on disease trajectories through protein interactions in the human body.

ResultsThe disparity in the weight of prevalent disease comorbidity patterns between the treatment and control groups highlights the impact of COVID-19. Certain specific comorbidity patterns show a more pronounced influence by COVID-19. For each comorbidity pattern, overlapping proteins directly associated with pre-existing diseases, post-infection diseases, and COVID-19 help to elucidate the biological mechanism of COVID-19s impact on each comorbidity pattern. Proteins essential for explaining the biological mechanism can be identified based on their weights.

ConclusionDisease comorbidity associations influenced by COVID-19, as identified through longitudinal electronic health records and disease-protein mapping, can help elucidate the biological mechanisms of COVID-19, discover intervention methods, and decode the molecular basis of comorbidity associations. This analysis can also yield potential biomarkers and corresponding treatments for specific disease patterns.

Ethical approvalEthical approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/HA HK West Cluster (UW20-556, UW21-149 and UW21-138).

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles up to Nov 30, 2022, with no language restrictions, using the terms &#34;Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19&#34; OR &#34;PASC&#34; OR &#34;Long COVID&#34; AND &#34;comorbidity&#34; OR &#34;multimorbidity&#34; OR &#34;co-morbidity&#34; OR &#34;multi-morbidity&#34;. We found most related papers focus on the comorbidity or multimorbidity patterns among PASC. Some papers focus on the associations between specific diseases and PASC. However, no study investigated the biological mechanism of PASC from the perspective of comorbidity network.

Added value of this studyThis study investigated the biological mechanism of PASC based on the comorbidity network including the impact of pre-existing diseases (diseases diagnosed within 730 days before COVID-19) on the development of PASC. We classified pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease (new diseases diagnosed in 28 days to 180 days after COVID-19) as comorbidity associations. Through a comparison of the frequency of comorbidity associations in health people group and patients with COVID-19 infection group, we identified comorbidity patterns that are significantly influenced by COVID-19 infection and constructed a comorbidity network comprising of 117 nodes (representing diseases) and 271 edges (representing comorbidity patterns). These comorbidity patterns suggest COVID-19 patients with these pre-existing diseases have higher risk for post-infection diseases. Through the analysis of the Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network and associations between diseases and proteins, we identified key proteins in the topological distance of each comorbidity pattern and important biological pathways by GO enrichment analysis. These proteins and biological pathways provide insights into the underlying biological mechanism of PASC.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe identification of elevated-risk comorbidity patterns associated with COVID-19 infection is crucial for the effective allocation of medical resources, ensuring prompt care for those in greatest need. Furthermore, it facilitates the recovery process of patients from COVID-19, offering a roadmap for their path back to health. The key proteins identified in our study have the potential to serve as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention, thereby establishing a foundation for the development of new drugs and the repurposing of existing ones. Further research should focus on drug discovery and the development of drug recommendations for patients with COVID-19 infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), are caused by permanent muscle injuries leading to chronic inflammation. In that context, macrophages harbor an altered inflammatory profile that contributes to fibrosis through the secretion of the profibrotic cytokine TGF{beta}1. We previously showed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces TGF{beta}1 secretion by macrophages and improves muscle homeostasis and muscle force in a mouse model of DMD. This makes AMPK an attractive therapeutic target for treating chronic inflammation and fibrosis in DMD. However, potent direct AMPK activators like compound 991 show strong adverse effects in vivo, preventing their direct use. Here, we encapsulated 991 into biodegradable polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles for in vivo delivery, in an attempt to overcome toxicity issues. We show that 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles retained drug activity on fibrotic macrophages in vitro, by reducing their secretion of TGF{beta}1. In the D2-mdx pre-clinical DMD mouse model, intravenously injected PLGA nanoparticles reached gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles, which are the most affected muscles in this model. Chronic intravenous injections of 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles decreased inflammation in both muscles, which was associated with fibrosis reduction and increase in myofiber size and muscle mass in the gastrocnemius. No impact on blood cell counts and liver enzymes was observed. These results demonstrate that nanomedicine is an efficient strategy to deliver AMPK activators in vivo to target inflammation and improve the dystrophic muscle phenotype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Sodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions. Objective: To investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption. Methods: Female and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression. Results: Chronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups. Conclusion: DC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. In this work, we present a workflow implemented at a laboratory CT setup, using semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification of lung tissue in an early screen of Covid-19 drug candidates. Different drugs were tested in a hamster model after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To make full use of the recorded high-throughput XPCT data, we then used morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing invaluable insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons with the ability to slide relative to each other. As optimal intra-tendinous sliding is thought to reduce the overall stress in the tendon, alterations in sliding behavior could potentially play a role in the development of Achilles tendinopathy. The aims of this study were to investigate the difference in intra-tendinous sliding within the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions between asymptomatic controls and patients with Achilles tendinopathy and the effect of changing the horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding in both groups. 29 participants (13 Achilles tendinopathy, 16 controls) performed isometric plantarflexion contractions at 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), in toes-neutral, and at 30% MVC in toes-neutral, toes-in and toes-out positions during which ultrasound images were recorded. Intra-tendinous sliding was estimated as the superficial-to-middle and middle-to-deep relative displacement. Our results indicate that patients with Achilles tendinopathy present lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Regarding the horizontal foot position in both groups, the toes-out foot position resulted in increased sliding compared to both toes-neutral and toes-out foot position. We provided evidence that patients with Achilles tendinopathy show lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Since intra-tendinous sliding is a physiological feature of the Achilles tendon, the external foot position holds promise to increase sliding in patients with Achilles tendinopathy and promote healthy tendon behavior. Future research should investigate if implementing this external foot position in rehabilitation programs stimulates sliding within the Achilles tendon and improves clinical outcome.</p>
