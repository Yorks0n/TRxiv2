OC43 is a human {beta}-coronavirus that induces mild clinical symptoms and can be safely studied in the BSL2 laboratory. Due to its low risk, OC43 can be a valuable and accessible model for understanding {beta}-coronavirus pathogenesis. One potential target for limiting virus infectivity could be gap junction-mediated communication. This study aims to unveil the status of cell-to-cell communications through gap junctions in human {beta}-coronavirus infection. Infection with OC43 leads to reduced expression of Cx43 in A549, a lung epithelial carcinoma cell line. Infection with this virus also showed a significant ER and oxidative stress increase. Internal localization of Cx43 is observed post OC43 infection in the ERGIC region, which impairs the gap junction communication between two adjacent cells, confirmed by Lucifer yellow dye transfer assay. It also affects hemichannel formation, as depicted by the EtBr uptake assay. Altogether, these results suggest that several physiological changes accompany OC43 infection in A549 cells and can be considered an appropriate model system for understanding the differences in gap junction communication post-viral infections. This model system can provide valuable insights for developing therapies against human {beta}-coronavirus infections. ImportanceThe enduring impact of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscores the importance of studying human {beta}-coronaviruses, advancing our preparedness for future coronavirus infections. Due to SARS-CoV-2 being highly infectious, another human {beta}-coronavirus OC43 can be considered as an experimental model. One of the crucial pathways that can be considered is gap junction communication, as it is vital for cellular homeostasis. Our study seeks to understand the change in Cx43-mediated cell-to-cell communication during human {beta}-coronavirus OC43 infection. In vitro studies showed the downregulation of the gap junction protein Cx43 and the upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress markers post-OC43 infection. Furthermore, OC43 infection causes impairment of functional hemichannel and gap junction formation. Overall, this current study infers that OC43 infection reshapes intercellular communication, suggesting that this pathway may be a promising target for designing highly effective therapeutics against human coronaviruses by regulating Cx43 expression.\nGenerating synthetic data in digital pathology through diffusion models: a multifaceted approach to evaluation\nAuthors: Pozzi, M.; Noei, S.; Robbi, E.; Cima, L.; Moroni, M.; Munari, E.; Torresani, E.; Jurman, G.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298808\nSynthetic data has recently risen as a new precious item in the computational pathologists toolbox, supporting several tasks such as helping with data scarcity or augmenting training set in deep learning. Nonetheless, the use of such novel resources requires a carefully planned construction and evaluation, to avoid pitfalls such as the generation of clinically meaningless artifacts. As the major outcome described in the current manuscript, a novel full stack pipeline is introduced for the generation and evaluation of synthetic pathology data powered by a diffusion model. The workflow features, as characterizing elements, a new multifaceted evaluation strategy with an embedded explainability procedure effectively tackling two critical aspects of the use of synthetic data in health-related domains. An ensemble-like strategy is adopted for the evaluation of the produced data, with the threefold aim of assessing the similarity of real and synthetic data through a set of well-established metrics, evaluating the practical usability of the generated images in deep learning models complemented by explainable AI methods, and validating their histopathological realism through a dedicated questionnaire answered by three professional pathologists. The pipeline is demonstrated on the public GTEx dataset of 650 WSIs, including five different tissues, conditioning the training step of the underlying diffusion model. An equal number of tiles from each of these five tissues are then generated. Finally, the reliability of the generated data is assessed using the proposed evaluation pipeline, with encouraging results. We show that each of these evaluation steps are necessary as they provide complementary information on the generated datas quality.

We present a novel deep learning algorithm predicting local gene expression from histopathology images. Our approach employs a graph isomorphism neural network capturing cell-to-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment and a Vision Transformer (CTransPath) for obtaining the tumor morphological features. Using a dataset of 30,612 spatially resolved gene expression profiles matched with histopathology images from 23 breast cancer patients, we identify 250 genes, including established breast cancer biomarkers, at a 100 {micro}m resolution. Additionally, we co-train our algorithm on spatial spot-level transcriptomics from 10x Visium breast cancer data along with another variant of our algorithm on TCGA-BRCA bulk RNA Seq. data, yielding mutual benefits and enhancing predictive accuracy on both these datasets. This work enables image-based screening for molecular biomarkers with spatial variation, promising breakthroughs in cancer research and diagnostics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Spatial transcriptomics allows precise RNA abundance measurement at high spatial resolution, linking cellular morphology with gene expression. We present a novel deep learning algorithm predicting local gene expression from histopathology images. Our approach employs a graph isomorphism neural network capturing cell-to-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment and a Vision Transformer (CTransPath) for obtaining the tumor morphological features. Using a dataset of 30,612 spatially resolved gene expression profiles matched with histopathology images from 23 breast cancer patients, we identify 250 genes, including established breast cancer biomarkers, at a 100 {micro}m resolution. Additionally, we co-train our algorithm on spatial spot-level transcriptomics from 10x Visium breast cancer data along with another variant of our algorithm on TCGA-BRCA bulk RNA Seq. data, yielding mutual benefits and enhancing predictive accuracy on both these datasets. This work enables image-based screening for molecular biomarkers with spatial variation, promising breakthroughs in cancer research and diagnostics.</p>
