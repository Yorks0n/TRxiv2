Generating high-quality 3D pathology datasets on a consistent basis is non-trivial, requiring careful attention to many details regarding tissue preparation, imaging, and data/image processing in an iterative process. Here we provide an end-to-end protocol covering all aspects of a 3D pathology workflow (using light-sheet microscopy as an illustrative imaging platform) with sufficient detail to perform well-controlled preclinical and clinical studies. While 3D pathology is compatible with diverse staining protocols and computationally generated color palettes for visual analysis, this protocol will focus on a fluorescent analog of hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E), which remains the most common stain for gold-standard diagnostic determinations. We present our guidelines for a broad range of end-users (e.g., biologists, clinical researchers, and engineers) in a simple tutorial format.\nAir Pollution Aggravates Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Acute Kidney Injury\nAuthors: Sanches, T.

N.; Kers, J.; Andrade, L.; Tammaro, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553734\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and declined renal function. PM2.5 exerts its harmful effects on various organs through oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involves similar biological processes involved in PM2.5 toxicity and is a known risk factor for CKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on IRI-induced AKI. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered air for 12 weeks before IRI, and were euthanized 48h after IRI. Animals exposed to PM2.5 and IRI exhibited reduced glomerular filtration and impaired urine concentration ability. Moreover, they showed elevated tubular damage markers NGAL and KIM-1, along with significant tubular necrosis. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated local innate immune activation, leading to an increased infiltration of Ly6G+ granulocytes and F480+ macrophages in the kidney. This, in turn, contributed to heightened renal senescence markers and myofibroblast infiltration. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKI-induced hampered tubular function is worsened by PM2.5, leading to reduced resilience to stress, activation of aging mechanisms and early hallmarks of fibrosis. Decreasing PM2.5 and implementing preventive strategies can improve AKI patients outcome and prevent AKI progression.\nAge-linked lung pathology is reduced by immunotherapeutic targeting of isoDGR protein damage\nAuthors: Kalailingam, P.; Mohd-Kahliab, K.-H.; SoFong Cam Ngan, S.

K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552994\nAging is a significant contributor to chronic lung disorders, yet the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study investigates the impact of isoDGR motif accumulation, a form of protein damage, on age-related lung pathology using both mouse models and human lung tissues. We utilized Pcmt1-/-mice, lacking the isoDGR repair enzyme, and treated them with motif-specific antibodies, employing a range of techniques including histology, RNA sequencing, imaging, and functional analyses. Human lung tissue microarrays (TMA) were also employed to assess isoDGR associations with lung aging and fibrosis. The study revealed notable isoDGR-modified protein accumulation in lung tissue and blood vessels of Pcmt1-/-mice, accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, variable pulmonary edema, and reduced lifespan. This isoDGR buildup triggered mitochondrial and ribosomal dysfunction, as well as cellular senescence and apoptosis, contributing to age-related lung damage. Treatment with anti-isoDGR antibodies suppressed TLR pathway activity, alleviated cytokine-driven inflammation, restored mtDNA expression, and led to reduced lung pathology in vivo. Similarly, exposure of lung endothelial cells to isoDGR-modified fibronectin hindered oxygen consumption, escalated reactive oxygen species, and disrupted acidification; these effects were reversed by motif-specific antibodies. TMA experiments further revealed a positive correlation between isoDGR-protein levels and CD68+ macrophage infiltration in aging lung fibrosis tissues. In conclusion, this study underscores the role of isoDGR-damaged lung proteins in age-related pulmonary inflammation, utilizing both mouse models and human lung tissues. Targeting these proteins with isoDGR-specific antibodies emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for addressing age-related pulmonary disorders in the elderly population.\nNovel Insights into the Aortic Mechanical Properties of Mice Modeling Hereditary Aortic Diseases\nAuthors: Dubacher, N.; Sugiyama, K.; Smith, J. D.; Nussbaumer, V.; Csonka, M.; Ferenczi, S.; Kovacs, K. J.; Caspar, S. M.; Lamberti, L.; Meienberg, J.; Yanagisawa, H.; Sheppard, M. B.; Matyas, G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553452\nOBJECTIVE: Hereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. APPROACH AND RESULT: We used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.\nFlexible and Highly-Efficient Feature Perception for Molecular Traits Prediction via Self-interactive Deep Learning\nAuthors: Hu, Y.; Sirinukunwattana, K.; Li, B.; Gaitskell, K.; Bonnaffe, W.; Wojciechowska, M.; Wood, R.; Alham, N. K.; Malacrino, S.; Woodcock, D.; Verrill, C.; Ahmed, A.; Rittscher, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.23293391\nPredicting disease-related molecular traits from histomorphology brings great opportunities for precision medicine. Despite the rich information present in histopathological images, extracting fine-grained molecular features from standard whole slide images (WSI) is non-trivial. The task is further complicated by the lack of annotations for subtyping and contextual histomorphological features that might span multiple scales. This work proposes a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework capable of WSI-based cancer morpho-molecular subtyping across scales. Our method, debuting as Inter-MIL, follows a weakly-supervised scheme. It enables the training of the patch-level encoder for WSI in a task-aware optimisation procedure, a step normally improbable in most existing MIL-based WSI analysis frameworks. We demonstrate that optimising the patch-level encoder is crucial to achieving high-quality fine-grained and tissue-level subtyping results and offers a significant improvement over task-agnostic encoders. Our approach deploys a pseudo-label propagation strategy to update the patch encoder iteratively, allowing discriminative subtype features to be learned. This mechanism also empowers extracting fine-grained attention within image tiles (the small patches), a task largely ignored in most existing weakly supervised-based frameworks. With Inter-MIL, we carried out four challenging cancer molecular subtyping tasks in the context of ovarian, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. Extensive evaluation results show that Inter-MIL is a robust framework for cancer morpho-molecular subtyping with superior performance compared to several recently proposed methods, even in data-limited scenarios where the number of available training slides is less than 100. The iterative optimisation mechanism of Inter-MIL significantly improves the quality of the image features learned by the patch embedded and generally directs the attention map to areas that better align with experts interpretation, leading to the identification of more reliable histopathology biomarkers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and declined renal function. PM2.5 exerts its harmful effects on various organs through oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involves similar biological processes involved in PM2.5 toxicity and is a known risk factor for CKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on IRI-induced AKI. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered air for 12 weeks before IRI, and were euthanized 48h after IRI. Animals exposed to PM2.5 and IRI exhibited reduced glomerular filtration and impaired urine concentration ability. Moreover, they showed elevated tubular damage markers NGAL and KIM-1, along with significant tubular necrosis. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated local innate immune activation, leading to an increased infiltration of Ly6G&#43; granulocytes and F480&#43; macrophages in the kidney. This, in turn, contributed to heightened renal senescence markers and myofibroblast infiltration. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKI-induced hampered tubular function is worsened by PM2.5, leading to reduced resilience to stress, activation of aging mechanisms and early hallmarks of fibrosis. Decreasing PM2.5 and implementing preventive strategies can improve AKI patients outcome and prevent AKI progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is a significant contributor to chronic lung disorders, yet the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study investigates the impact of isoDGR motif accumulation, a form of protein damage, on age-related lung pathology using both mouse models and human lung tissues. We utilized Pcmt1-/-mice, lacking the isoDGR repair enzyme, and treated them with motif-specific antibodies, employing a range of techniques including histology, RNA sequencing, imaging, and functional analyses. Human lung tissue microarrays (TMA) were also employed to assess isoDGR associations with lung aging and fibrosis.

The study revealed notable isoDGR-modified protein accumulation in lung tissue and blood vessels of Pcmt1-/-mice, accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, variable pulmonary edema, and reduced lifespan. This isoDGR buildup triggered mitochondrial and ribosomal dysfunction, as well as cellular senescence and apoptosis, contributing to age-related lung damage. Treatment with anti-isoDGR antibodies suppressed TLR pathway activity, alleviated cytokine-driven inflammation, restored mtDNA expression, and led to reduced lung pathology in vivo. Similarly, exposure of lung endothelial cells to isoDGR-modified fibronectin hindered oxygen consumption, escalated reactive oxygen species, and disrupted acidification; these effects were reversed by motif-specific antibodies. TMA experiments further revealed a positive correlation between isoDGR-protein levels and CD68&#43; macrophage infiltration in aging lung fibrosis tissues.

In conclusion, this study underscores the role of isoDGR-damaged lung proteins in age-related pulmonary inflammation, utilizing both mouse models and human lung tissues. Targeting these proteins with isoDGR-specific antibodies emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for addressing age-related pulmonary disorders in the elderly population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVE: Hereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. APPROACH AND RESULT: We used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predicting disease-related molecular traits from histomorphology brings great opportunities for precision medicine. Despite the rich information present in histopathological images, extracting fine-grained molecular features from standard whole slide images (WSI) is non-trivial. The task is further complicated by the lack of annotations for subtyping and contextual histomorphological features that might span multiple scales. This work proposes a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework capable of WSI-based cancer morpho-molecular subtyping across scales. Our method, debuting as Inter-MIL, follows a weakly-supervised scheme. It enables the training of the patch-level encoder for WSI in a task-aware optimisation procedure, a step normally improbable in most existing MIL-based WSI analysis frameworks. We demonstrate that optimising the patch-level encoder is crucial to achieving high-quality fine-grained and tissue-level subtyping results and offers a significant improvement over task-agnostic encoders. Our approach deploys a pseudo-label propagation strategy to update the patch encoder iteratively, allowing discriminative subtype features to be learned. This mechanism also empowers extracting fine-grained attention within image tiles (the small patches), a task largely ignored in most existing weakly supervised-based frameworks. With Inter-MIL, we carried out four challenging cancer molecular subtyping tasks in the context of ovarian, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. Extensive evaluation results show that Inter-MIL is a robust framework for cancer morpho-molecular subtyping with superior performance compared to several recently proposed methods, even in data-limited scenarios where the number of available training slides is less than 100. The iterative optimisation mechanism of Inter-MIL significantly improves the quality of the image features learned by the patch embedded and generally directs the attention map to areas that better align with experts interpretation, leading to the identification of more reliable histopathology biomarkers.</p>
