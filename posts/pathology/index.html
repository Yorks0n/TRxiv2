This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nComparative analysis of kidney transplantation modeled using precision-cut kidney slices and kidney transplantation in pigs\nAuthors: Moor, M. B.; Nordström, J.; Burmakin, M.; Raki, M.; Al-Saad, S.; Nowak, G.; Wennberg, L.; Patrakka, J.; Olauson, H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575664\nKidney transplants are at risk for so far unavoidable ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several experimental kidney transplantation models are available to study this injury, but all have their own limitations. Here, we describe precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) as a novel model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in comparison with pig and human kidney transplantation. Following bilateral nephrectomy in pigs, we applied warm ischemia (1h), cold ischemia (20h) and a reperfusion period (4h) to one whole kidney undergoing transplantation to a recipient pig and, in parallel, established PCKS undergoing ischemia and modeled reperfusion. Histopathological assessment revealed the presence of some but not all morphological features of tubular injury in PCKS as seen in pig kidney transplantation. RNAseq demonstrated that the majority of changes occurred after reperfusion only, with a partial overlap between PCKS and kidney transplantation, with some differences in transcriptional response attributable to systemic inflammatory responses and immune cell migration. Comparison of PCKS and pig kidney transplantation with RNAseq data from human kidney biopsies by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that both PCKS and pig kidney transplantation reproduced the post-reperfusion pattern of human kidney transplantation. In contrast, only post-cold ischemia PCKS and pig kidney partially resembled the gene set of human acute kidney injury. Overall, the present study established that a PCKS protocol can model kidney transplantation and its reperfusion-related damage on a histological and a transcriptomic level. PCKS may thus expand the toolbox for developing novel therapeutic strategies against ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nDeciphering the Molecular Mechanism of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 through Comorbidity Network Analysis\nAuthors: Tian, L.; Wong, I. C. K.; Zhang, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575851\nIntroduction: The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 presents a significant health challenge in the post-pandemic world. Our study aims to analyze longitudinal electronic health records to determine the impact of COVID-19 on disease progression, provide molecular insights into these mechanisms, and identify associated biomarkers. Method: We included 58,710 patients with COVID-19 records from 01/01/2020 to 31/08/2022 and at least one hospital admission before and after the acute phase of COVID-19 (28 days) as the treatment group. A healthy control group of 174,071 individuals was established for comparison using propensity score matching based on pre-existing diseases (before COVID-19). We built a comorbidity network using Pearson correlation coefficient differences between pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease in both groups. Disease-protein mapping and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed the impact of COVID-19 on disease trajectories through protein interactions in the human body. Results: The disparity in the weight of prevalent disease comorbidity patterns between the treatment and control groups highlights the impact of COVID-19. Certain specific comorbidity patterns show a more pronounced influence by COVID-19. For each comorbidity pattern, overlapping proteins directly associated with pre-existing diseases, post-infection diseases, and COVID-19 help to elucidate the biological mechanism of COVID-19's impact on each comorbidity pattern. Proteins essential for explaining the biological mechanism can be identified based on their weights. Conclusion: Disease comorbidity associations influenced by COVID-19, as identified through longitudinal electronic health records and disease-protein mapping, can help elucidate the biological mechanisms of COVID-19, discover intervention methods, and decode the molecular basis of comorbidity associations. This analysis can also yield potential biomarkers and corresponding treatments for specific disease patterns.\nPolymeric nanoparticles delivery of AMPK activator 991 prevents its toxicity and improves muscle homeostasis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\nAuthors: Andreana, I.; Kneppers, A.; Ben Larbi, S.; Tifni, F.; Fessard, A.; Sidi-Boumedine, J.; Kryza, D.; Stella, B.; Bordes, C.; Arpicco, S.; Chevalier, Y.; Chazaud, B.; Mounier, R.; Lollo, G.; Juban, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575840\nMuscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), are caused by permanent muscle injuries leading to chronic inflammation. In that context, macrophages harbor an altered inflammatory profile that contributes to fibrosis through the secretion of the profibrotic cytokine TGF{beta}1. We previously showed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces TGF{beta}1 secretion by macrophages and improves muscle homeostasis and muscle force in a mouse model of DMD. This makes AMPK an attractive therapeutic target for treating chronic inflammation and fibrosis in DMD. However, potent direct AMPK activators like compound 991 show strong adverse effects in vivo, preventing their direct use. Here, we encapsulated 991 into biodegradable polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles for in vivo delivery, in an attempt to overcome toxicity issues. We show that 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles retained drug activity on fibrotic macrophages in vitro, by reducing their secretion of TGF{beta}1. In the D2-mdx pre-clinical DMD mouse model, intravenously injected PLGA nanoparticles reached gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles, which are the most affected muscles in this model. Chronic intravenous injections of 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles decreased inflammation in both muscles, which was associated with fibrosis reduction and increase in myofiber size and muscle mass in the gastrocnemius. No impact on blood cell counts and liver enzymes was observed. These results demonstrate that nanomedicine is an efficient strategy to deliver AMPK activators in vivo to target inflammation and improve the dystrophic muscle phenotype.\nDifferent outcomes of endurance and resistance exercise in skeletal muscles of Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.\nAuthors: Boulinguiez, A.; Dhiab, J.; Crisol, B.; Muraine, L.; Gaut, L.; Rouxel, C.; Flaire, J.; Mouigni, H.-R.; Lemaitre, M.; Giroux, B.; Adoux, L.; SaintPierre, B.; Ferry, A.; Mouly, V.; Butler-Bowne, G. S.; Negroni, E.; Malerba, A.; Trollet, C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575335\nBackgroundExercise is widely considered to have beneficial impact on skeletal muscle aging. In addition, there are also several studies demonstrating a positive effect of exercise on muscular dystrophies. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the PAPBN1 gene. These mutations consist in short (1-8) and meiotically stable GCN trinucleotide repeat expansions in its coding region responsible for the formation of PAPBN1 intranuclear aggregates. This study aims to characterize the effects of two types of chronic exercise, resistance and endurance, on the OPMD skeletal muscle phenotype using a relevant murine model of OPMD. MethodsIn this study, we tested two protocols of exercise. In the first, based on endurance exercise, FvB (wild-type) and A17 (OPMD) mice underwent a 6-week-long motorized treadmill protocol consisting in 3 sessions per week of running 20cm/s for 20 minutes. In the second protocol, based on resistance exercise generated by chronic mechanical overload (OVL), surgical removal of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was performed, inducing hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle. In both types of exercise, muscles of A17 and FvB mice were compared to those of respective sedentary mice. For all the groups, force measurement, muscle histology and molecular analyses were conducted. ResultsFollowing the endurance exercise protocol, we did not observe any major changes in the muscle physiological parameters, but an increase in the number of PABPN1 intranuclear aggregates and enhanced collagen deposition in the exercised A17 OPMD mice. In the resistance overload protocol, we also observed an increased collagen deposition in the A17 OPMD mice which was associated with larger muscle mass and fiber cross sectional area and increased absolute maximal force as well as a reduction in PABPN1 aggregate number. ConclusionsRunning exercise and mechanical overload led to very different outcome in skeletal muscles of A17 mice. Both types of exercise enhanced collagen deposition but while the running protocol increased aggregates, the OVL reduced them. More importantly OVL reversed muscle atrophy and maximal force in the A17 mice. Our study performed in a relevant model gives an indication of the effect of different types of exercise on OPMD muscle which should be further evaluated in humans for future recommendations as a part of the lifestyle of individuals with OPMD.\nReduced intra-tendinous sliding in Achilles tendinopathy during active plantarflexion regardless of horizontal foot position\nAuthors: Lecompte, L.; Crouzier, M.; Bogaerts, S.; Scheys, L.; Vanwanseele, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574669\nThe Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons with the ability to slide relative to each other. As optimal intra-tendinous sliding is thought to reduce the overall stress in the tendon, alterations in sliding behavior could potentially play a role in the development of Achilles tendinopathy. The aims of this study were to investigate the difference in intra-tendinous sliding within the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions between asymptomatic controls and patients with Achilles tendinopathy and the effect of changing the horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding in both groups. 29 participants (13 Achilles tendinopathy, 16 controls) performed isometric plantarflexion contractions at 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), in toes-neutral, and at 30% MVC in toes-neutral, toes-in and toes-out positions during which ultrasound images were recorded. Intra-tendinous sliding was estimated as the superficial-to-middle and middle-to-deep relative displacement. Our results indicate that patients with Achilles tendinopathy present lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Regarding the horizontal foot position in both groups, the toes-out foot position resulted in increased sliding compared to both toes-neutral and toes-out foot position. We provided evidence that patients with Achilles tendinopathy show lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Since intra-tendinous sliding is a physiological feature of the Achilles tendon, the external foot position holds promise to increase sliding in patients with Achilles tendinopathy and promote healthy tendon behavior. Future research should investigate if implementing this external foot position in rehabilitation programs stimulates sliding within the Achilles tendon and improves clinical outcome.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kidney transplants are at risk for so far unavoidable ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several experimental kidney transplantation models are available to study this injury, but all have their own limitations. Here, we describe precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) as a novel model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in comparison with pig and human kidney transplantation. Following bilateral nephrectomy in pigs, we applied warm ischemia (1h), cold ischemia (20h) and a reperfusion period (4h) to one whole kidney undergoing transplantation to a recipient pig and, in parallel, established PCKS undergoing ischemia and modeled reperfusion. Histopathological assessment revealed the presence of some but not all morphological features of tubular injury in PCKS as seen in pig kidney transplantation. RNAseq demonstrated that the majority of changes occurred after reperfusion only, with a partial overlap between PCKS and kidney transplantation, with some differences in transcriptional response attributable to systemic inflammatory responses and immune cell migration. Comparison of PCKS and pig kidney transplantation with RNAseq data from human kidney biopsies by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that both PCKS and pig kidney transplantation reproduced the post-reperfusion pattern of human kidney transplantation. In contrast, only post-cold ischemia PCKS and pig kidney partially resembled the gene set of human acute kidney injury. Overall, the present study established that a PCKS protocol can model kidney transplantation and its reperfusion-related damage on a histological and a transcriptomic level. PCKS may thus expand the toolbox for developing novel therapeutic strategies against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 presents a significant health challenge in the post-pandemic world. Our study aims to analyze longitudinal electronic health records to determine the impact of COVID-19 on disease progression, provide molecular insights into these mechanisms, and identify associated biomarkers. Method: We included 58,710 patients with COVID-19 records from 01/01/2020 to 31/08/2022 and at least one hospital admission before and after the acute phase of COVID-19 (28 days) as the treatment group. A healthy control group of 174,071 individuals was established for comparison using propensity score matching based on pre-existing diseases (before COVID-19). We built a comorbidity network using Pearson correlation coefficient differences between pairs of pre-existing disease and post-infection disease in both groups. Disease-protein mapping and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed the impact of COVID-19 on disease trajectories through protein interactions in the human body. Results: The disparity in the weight of prevalent disease comorbidity patterns between the treatment and control groups highlights the impact of COVID-19. Certain specific comorbidity patterns show a more pronounced influence by COVID-19. For each comorbidity pattern, overlapping proteins directly associated with pre-existing diseases, post-infection diseases, and COVID-19 help to elucidate the biological mechanism of COVID-19&#39;s impact on each comorbidity pattern. Proteins essential for explaining the biological mechanism can be identified based on their weights. Conclusion: Disease comorbidity associations influenced by COVID-19, as identified through longitudinal electronic health records and disease-protein mapping, can help elucidate the biological mechanisms of COVID-19, discover intervention methods, and decode the molecular basis of comorbidity associations. This analysis can also yield potential biomarkers and corresponding treatments for specific disease patterns.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), are caused by permanent muscle injuries leading to chronic inflammation. In that context, macrophages harbor an altered inflammatory profile that contributes to fibrosis through the secretion of the profibrotic cytokine TGF{beta}1. We previously showed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces TGF{beta}1 secretion by macrophages and improves muscle homeostasis and muscle force in a mouse model of DMD. This makes AMPK an attractive therapeutic target for treating chronic inflammation and fibrosis in DMD. However, potent direct AMPK activators like compound 991 show strong adverse effects in vivo, preventing their direct use. Here, we encapsulated 991 into biodegradable polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles for in vivo delivery, in an attempt to overcome toxicity issues. We show that 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles retained drug activity on fibrotic macrophages in vitro, by reducing their secretion of TGF{beta}1. In the D2-mdx pre-clinical DMD mouse model, intravenously injected PLGA nanoparticles reached gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles, which are the most affected muscles in this model. Chronic intravenous injections of 991-loaded PLGA nanoparticles decreased inflammation in both muscles, which was associated with fibrosis reduction and increase in myofiber size and muscle mass in the gastrocnemius. No impact on blood cell counts and liver enzymes was observed. These results demonstrate that nanomedicine is an efficient strategy to deliver AMPK activators in vivo to target inflammation and improve the dystrophic muscle phenotype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExercise is widely considered to have beneficial impact on skeletal muscle aging. In addition, there are also several studies demonstrating a positive effect of exercise on muscular dystrophies. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the PAPBN1 gene. These mutations consist in short (1-8) and meiotically stable GCN trinucleotide repeat expansions in its coding region responsible for the formation of PAPBN1 intranuclear aggregates. This study aims to characterize the effects of two types of chronic exercise, resistance and endurance, on the OPMD skeletal muscle phenotype using a relevant murine model of OPMD.

MethodsIn this study, we tested two protocols of exercise. In the first, based on endurance exercise, FvB (wild-type) and A17 (OPMD) mice underwent a 6-week-long motorized treadmill protocol consisting in 3 sessions per week of running 20cm/s for 20 minutes. In the second protocol, based on resistance exercise generated by chronic mechanical overload (OVL), surgical removal of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was performed, inducing hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle. In both types of exercise, muscles of A17 and FvB mice were compared to those of respective sedentary mice. For all the groups, force measurement, muscle histology and molecular analyses were conducted.

ResultsFollowing the endurance exercise protocol, we did not observe any major changes in the muscle physiological parameters, but an increase in the number of PABPN1 intranuclear aggregates and enhanced collagen deposition in the exercised A17 OPMD mice. In the resistance overload protocol, we also observed an increased collagen deposition in the A17 OPMD mice which was associated with larger muscle mass and fiber cross sectional area and increased absolute maximal force as well as a reduction in PABPN1 aggregate number.

ConclusionsRunning exercise and mechanical overload led to very different outcome in skeletal muscles of A17 mice. Both types of exercise enhanced collagen deposition but while the running protocol increased aggregates, the OVL reduced them. More importantly OVL reversed muscle atrophy and maximal force in the A17 mice. Our study performed in a relevant model gives an indication of the effect of different types of exercise on OPMD muscle which should be further evaluated in humans for future recommendations as a part of the lifestyle of individuals with OPMD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons with the ability to slide relative to each other. As optimal intra-tendinous sliding is thought to reduce the overall stress in the tendon, alterations in sliding behavior could potentially play a role in the development of Achilles tendinopathy. The aims of this study were to investigate the difference in intra-tendinous sliding within the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions between asymptomatic controls and patients with Achilles tendinopathy and the effect of changing the horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding in both groups. 29 participants (13 Achilles tendinopathy, 16 controls) performed isometric plantarflexion contractions at 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), in toes-neutral, and at 30% MVC in toes-neutral, toes-in and toes-out positions during which ultrasound images were recorded. Intra-tendinous sliding was estimated as the superficial-to-middle and middle-to-deep relative displacement. Our results indicate that patients with Achilles tendinopathy present lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Regarding the horizontal foot position in both groups, the toes-out foot position resulted in increased sliding compared to both toes-neutral and toes-out foot position. We provided evidence that patients with Achilles tendinopathy show lower intra-tendinous sliding compared to asymptomatic controls. Since intra-tendinous sliding is a physiological feature of the Achilles tendon, the external foot position holds promise to increase sliding in patients with Achilles tendinopathy and promote healthy tendon behavior. Future research should investigate if implementing this external foot position in rehabilitation programs stimulates sliding within the Achilles tendon and improves clinical outcome.</p>
