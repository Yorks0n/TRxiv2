T.; van der Ploeg, M.; Wesseling, J.; Neefjes, J.\nScore: 38.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555057\nThe association between bacterial activity and tumorigenesis has gained attention in recent years, alongside the well-established link between viruses and cancer. A recent study proposed the presence of intracellular bacteria in cancer cells, particularly in melanomas and breast cancers, with detectable bacterial DNA. The authors suggested that these bacteria contribute to the tumors' development. We sought to replicate these findings using the same experimental methods on different tissue microarrays. Our investigation included 129 breast cancer samples, but we found no evidence of LPS expression within cancer cells. Instead, LPS immunoreactivity was observed in ducts or immune cells, specifically macrophages. The discrepancies in LPS staining warrant caution in interpreting the reported observations, and further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of intracellular bacteria in cancer development.\nAn end-to-end workflow for non-destructive 3D pathology\nAuthors: Bishop, K. W.; Barner, L. A. E.; Han, Q.; Baraznenok, E.; Lan, L.; Poudel, C.; Gao, G.; Serafin, R. B.; Chow, S. S. L.; Glaser, A. K.; Janowczyk, A.; Brenes, D.; Huang, H.; Miyasato, D.; True, L.

C.\nScore: 137.5, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551845\nRecent advances in 3D pathology offer the ability to image orders-of-magnitude more tissue than conventional pathology while providing a volumetric context that is lacking with 2D tissue sections, all without requiring destructive tissue sectioning. Generating high-quality 3D pathology datasets on a consistent basis is non-trivial, requiring careful attention to many details regarding tissue preparation, imaging, and data/image processing in an iterative process. Here we provide an end-to-end protocol covering all aspects of a 3D pathology workflow (using light-sheet microscopy as an illustrative imaging platform) with sufficient detail to perform well-controlled preclinical and clinical studies. While 3D pathology is compatible with diverse staining protocols and computationally generated color palettes for visual analysis, this protocol will focus on a fluorescent analog of hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E), which remains the most common stain for gold-standard diagnostic determinations. We present our guidelines for a broad range of end-users (e.g., biologists, clinical researchers, and engineers) in a simple tutorial format.\nNovel Insights into the Aortic Mechanical Properties of Mice Modeling Hereditary Aortic Diseases\nAuthors: Dubacher, N.; Sugiyama, K.; Smith, J. D.; Nussbaumer, V.; Csonka, M.; Ferenczi, S.; Kovacs, K. J.; Caspar, S. M.; Lamberti, L.; Meienberg, J.; Yanagisawa, H.; Sheppard, M. B.; Matyas, G.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553452\nOBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.

C.; Noffsinger, V. P.; Meredith, L. W.; de Beer, F. C.; Mullick, A. E.; Webb, N. R.; Karounos, D. G.; Tannock, L. R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554377\nObjectiveObesity increases the risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in humans and enhances angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAA formation in C57BL/6 mice. Obesity is also associated with increases in serum amyloid A (SAA). We previously reported that deficiency of SAA significantly reduces AngII-induced inflammation and AAA in both hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient and obese C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we investigated whether SAA plays a role in the progression of early AAA in obese C57BL/6 mice. Approach and ResultsMale C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal as fat) throughout the study. After 4 months of diet, the mice were infused with angiotensin II (AngII) until the end of the study. Mice with at least a 25% increase in the luminal diameter of the abdominal aorta after 4 weeks of AngII infusion were stratified into 2 groups. The first group received a control antisense oligonucleotide (Ctr ASO), and the second group received ASO that suppresses SAA (SAA-ASO) until the end of the study. Plasma SAA levels were significantly reduced by the SAA ASO treatment. While mice that received the control ASO had continued aortic dilation throughout the AngII infusion periods, the mice that received SAA-ASO had a significant reduction in the progression of aortic dilation, which was associated with significant reductions in matrix metalloprotease activities, decreased macrophage infiltration and decreased elastin breaks in the abdominal aortas. ConclusionWe demonstrate for the first time that suppression of SAA protects obese C57BL/6 mice from the progression of AngII-induced AAA. Suppression of SAA may be a therapeutic approach to limit AAA progression. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPlasma Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels are significantly reduced by SAA-specific antisense-oligonucleotide (SAA ASO) treatment. C_LIO_LISAA ASO treatment significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease activities, macrophage infiltration, and elastin breaks in the abdominal aorta during the progression of AAA in obese C57BL/6J mice. C_LIO_LITreatment with SAA ASO significantly reduced the progression of aortic dilation, thus limiting the progression of the disease. C_LI\nMacrophage-targeted DNA methyltransferase inhibitor SGI-1027 decreases atherosclerosis in ApoE-null mice\nAuthors: Marquez-Sanchez, A. C.; Manzanares-Guzman, A.; Carriles-Jaimes, R.; Sanchez-Segura, L.; Colin-Castelan, D.; Kamen, D.; Koltsova, E. K.; Maritnez-Antonio, A.; Rodriguez-Rios, D.; Romo-Morales, G. d. C.; Lund, G.; Zaina, S.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554347\nBackground and aimsCorrection of vascular DNA hypermethylation may slow atherogenesis. We tested the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity of macrophage-targeted DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor SGI-1027. Methods, ResultsSGI-1027 was encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles (HSANP) functionalized with the PP1 peptide, a macrophage scavenger receptor 1 ligand, fused to a FLAG epitope (S-HSANP-FLAGPP1). Nanoparticle physico-chemical characteristics predicted good marginalization towards the vascular wall, although SGI-1027 encapsulation efficiency was relatively low ([~]23%). S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 were rapidly internalized compared to non-functionalized and, surprisingly, functionalized void controls, and induced a shift towards an anti-inflammatory profile of secreted cytokines in human THP-1 macrophages. S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 colonized the atheroma and induced a significant [~]44% reduction of atherosclerosis burden in the aortic tree of ApoE-null mice compared to controls. A reduction in aortic root atherosclerosis was observed, although primarily induced by HSANP irrespective of loading or functionalization. No alteration of body weight, non-vascular tissue gross histology, plasma glucose, triglyceride or cholesterol were observed. HSA whether free or structured in nanoparticles, induced a 3-4-fold increase in HDL compared to vehicle. ConclusionsWe confirm that DNMT inhibition is anti-atherogenic and provide proof of principle that targeted HSANP are effective carriers for those molecules. SGI-1027 displayed a novel anti-inflammatory activity that is independent of cell proliferation and therefore likely unrelated to DNMT inhibition. HDL elevation may represent an additional advantage of HSA-based nanocarriers.\nNeuronal SNCA transcription during Lewy body formation\nAuthors: Kon, T.; Forrest, S. L.; Lee, S.; Martinez Valbuena, I.; Li, J.; Nassir, N.; Uddin, M. J.; Lang, A. E.; Kovacs, G. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553427\nBackgroundMisfolded -synuclein (-syn) is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease (LBD) based on considerable evidence including a gene-dosage effect observed in relation to point mutations and multiplication of SNCA in familial Parkinsons disease. A contradictory concept proposes early loss of the physiological -syn as the major driver of neurodegeneration. There is a paucity of data on SNCA transcripts in various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies. MethodsSNCA transcripts in neurons without and with various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies in the substantia nigra and amygdala in LBD (n = 5) were evaluated using RNAscope combined with immunofluorescence for disease-associated -syn. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate cell-type specific SNCA expression in non-diseased frontal cortex (n = 3). ResultsSNCA transcripts in neurons with punctate -syn immunoreactivity were preserved both in the substantia nigra and amygdala but were reduced in neurons with compact -syn inclusions. Only single SNCA transcripts were detected in astrocytes with or without -syn immunoreactivity in the amygdala. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and homeostatic microglia expressed SNCA transcripts, while expression was largely absent in astrocytes and microglia. ConclusionsThe preserved cellular SNCA expression in the more abundant non-Lewy body type -syn cytopathologies provides a pool for local protein production that can aggregate and serve as a seed for misfolded -syn. Successful segregation of disease-associated -syn is associated with the exhaustion of SNCA production in the terminal cytopathology, the Lewy body. Our observations support a therapeutic strategy incorporating a finely tuned dual approach targeting the elimination of misfolded -syn along with the reduction of the SNCA transcription to avoid feeding of pathological -syn seeding.\nThree dimensional fibrotic extracellular matrix directs microenvironment fiber remodeling by fibroblasts\nAuthors: Nizamoglu, M.; Alleblas, F.; Koster, T.; Borghuis, T.; Vonk, J. M.; Thomas, M. J.; White, E. S.; Kirstin Watson, C.; Timens, W.; El Kasmi, K. C.; Melgert, B. N.; Heijink, I. H.; Burgess, J. K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552411\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), for which effective treatments are limited, results in excessive and disorganized deposition of an aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM). An altered ECM microenvironment is postulated to contribute to disease perpetuation in a feed-forward manner through inducing profibrotic behavior by lung fibroblasts, the main producers and regulators of ECM. Here, we examined this hypothesis in a 3D in vitro model system by growing primary human lung fibroblasts in ECM-derived hydrogels from non-fibrotic (control) or IPF lung tissue. Culture of fibroblasts in fibrotic hydrogels did not trigger a change in the overall amount of collagen or glycosaminoglycans but did cause a drastic change in fiber organization compared to culture in control hydrogels. Mechanical properties of fibrotic hydrogels were modified by fibroblasts while control hydrogels were not. These results illustrate how the 3D microenvironment plays a crucial role in directing cells to exhibit pro-fibrotic responses by providing biochemical and/or biomechanical cues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The association between bacterial activity and tumorigenesis has gained attention in recent years, alongside the well-established link between viruses and cancer. A recent study proposed the presence of intracellular bacteria in cancer cells, particularly in melanomas and breast cancers, with detectable bacterial DNA. The authors suggested that these bacteria contribute to the tumors&#39; development. We sought to replicate these findings using the same experimental methods on different tissue microarrays. Our investigation included 129 breast cancer samples, but we found no evidence of LPS expression within cancer cells. Instead, LPS immunoreactivity was observed in ducts or immune cells, specifically macrophages. The discrepancies in LPS staining warrant caution in interpreting the reported observations, and further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of intracellular bacteria in cancer development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in 3D pathology offer the ability to image orders-of-magnitude more tissue than conventional pathology while providing a volumetric context that is lacking with 2D tissue sections, all without requiring destructive tissue sectioning. Generating high-quality 3D pathology datasets on a consistent basis is non-trivial, requiring careful attention to many details regarding tissue preparation, imaging, and data/image processing in an iterative process. Here we provide an end-to-end protocol covering all aspects of a 3D pathology workflow (using light-sheet microscopy as an illustrative imaging platform) with sufficient detail to perform well-controlled preclinical and clinical studies. While 3D pathology is compatible with diverse staining protocols and computationally generated color palettes for visual analysis, this protocol will focus on a fluorescent analog of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), which remains the most common stain for gold-standard diagnostic determinations. We present our guidelines for a broad range of end-users (e.g., biologists, clinical researchers, and engineers) in a simple tutorial format.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models.

APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice.

CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveObesity increases the risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in humans and enhances angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAA formation in C57BL/6 mice. Obesity is also associated with increases in serum amyloid A (SAA). We previously reported that deficiency of SAA significantly reduces AngII-induced inflammation and AAA in both hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient and obese C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we investigated whether SAA plays a role in the progression of early AAA in obese C57BL/6 mice.

Approach and ResultsMale C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal as fat) throughout the study. After 4 months of diet, the mice were infused with angiotensin II (AngII) until the end of the study. Mice with at least a 25% increase in the luminal diameter of the abdominal aorta after 4 weeks of AngII infusion were stratified into 2 groups. The first group received a control antisense oligonucleotide (Ctr ASO), and the second group received ASO that suppresses SAA (SAA-ASO) until the end of the study. Plasma SAA levels were significantly reduced by the SAA ASO treatment. While mice that received the control ASO had continued aortic dilation throughout the AngII infusion periods, the mice that received SAA-ASO had a significant reduction in the progression of aortic dilation, which was associated with significant reductions in matrix metalloprotease activities, decreased macrophage infiltration and decreased elastin breaks in the abdominal aortas.

ConclusionWe demonstrate for the first time that suppression of SAA protects obese C57BL/6 mice from the progression of AngII-induced AAA. Suppression of SAA may be a therapeutic approach to limit AAA progression.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPlasma Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels are significantly reduced by SAA-specific antisense-oligonucleotide (SAA ASO) treatment.
C_LIO_LISAA ASO treatment significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease activities, macrophage infiltration, and elastin breaks in the abdominal aorta during the progression of AAA in obese C57BL/6J mice.
C_LIO_LITreatment with SAA ASO significantly reduced the progression of aortic dilation, thus limiting the progression of the disease.

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimsCorrection of vascular DNA hypermethylation may slow atherogenesis. We tested the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity of macrophage-targeted DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor SGI-1027.

Methods, ResultsSGI-1027 was encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles (HSANP) functionalized with the PP1 peptide, a macrophage scavenger receptor 1 ligand, fused to a FLAG epitope (S-HSANP-FLAGPP1). Nanoparticle physico-chemical characteristics predicted good marginalization towards the vascular wall, although SGI-1027 encapsulation efficiency was relatively low ([~]23%). S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 were rapidly internalized compared to non-functionalized and, surprisingly, functionalized void controls, and induced a shift towards an anti-inflammatory profile of secreted cytokines in human THP-1 macrophages. S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 colonized the atheroma and induced a significant [~]44% reduction of atherosclerosis burden in the aortic tree of ApoE-null mice compared to controls. A reduction in aortic root atherosclerosis was observed, although primarily induced by HSANP irrespective of loading or functionalization. No alteration of body weight, non-vascular tissue gross histology, plasma glucose, triglyceride or cholesterol were observed. HSA whether free or structured in nanoparticles, induced a 3-4-fold increase in HDL compared to vehicle.

ConclusionsWe confirm that DNMT inhibition is anti-atherogenic and provide proof of principle that targeted HSANP are effective carriers for those molecules. SGI-1027 displayed a novel anti-inflammatory activity that is independent of cell proliferation and therefore likely unrelated to DNMT inhibition. HDL elevation may represent an additional advantage of HSA-based nanocarriers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMisfolded -synuclein (-syn) is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease (LBD) based on considerable evidence including a gene-dosage effect observed in relation to point mutations and multiplication of SNCA in familial Parkinsons disease. A contradictory concept proposes early loss of the physiological -syn as the major driver of neurodegeneration. There is a paucity of data on SNCA transcripts in various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies.

MethodsSNCA transcripts in neurons without and with various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies in the substantia nigra and amygdala in LBD (n = 5) were evaluated using RNAscope combined with immunofluorescence for disease-associated -syn. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate cell-type specific SNCA expression in non-diseased frontal cortex (n = 3).

ResultsSNCA transcripts in neurons with punctate -syn immunoreactivity were preserved both in the substantia nigra and amygdala but were reduced in neurons with compact -syn inclusions. Only single SNCA transcripts were detected in astrocytes with or without -syn immunoreactivity in the amygdala. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and homeostatic microglia expressed SNCA transcripts, while expression was largely absent in astrocytes and microglia.

ConclusionsThe preserved cellular SNCA expression in the more abundant non-Lewy body type -syn cytopathologies provides a pool for local protein production that can aggregate and serve as a seed for misfolded -syn. Successful segregation of disease-associated -syn is associated with the exhaustion of SNCA production in the terminal cytopathology, the Lewy body. Our observations support a therapeutic strategy incorporating a finely tuned dual approach targeting the elimination of misfolded -syn along with the reduction of the SNCA transcription to avoid feeding of pathological -syn seeding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), for which effective treatments are limited, results in excessive and disorganized deposition of an aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM). An altered ECM microenvironment is postulated to contribute to disease perpetuation in a feed-forward manner through inducing profibrotic behavior by lung fibroblasts, the main producers and regulators of ECM. Here, we examined this hypothesis in a 3D in vitro model system by growing primary human lung fibroblasts in ECM-derived hydrogels from non-fibrotic (control) or IPF lung tissue. Culture of fibroblasts in fibrotic hydrogels did not trigger a change in the overall amount of collagen or glycosaminoglycans but did cause a drastic change in fiber organization compared to culture in control hydrogels. Mechanical properties of fibrotic hydrogels were modified by fibroblasts while control hydrogels were not. These results illustrate how the 3D microenvironment plays a crucial role in directing cells to exhibit pro-fibrotic responses by providing biochemical and/or biomechanical cues.</p>
