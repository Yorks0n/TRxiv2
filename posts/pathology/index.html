Generating high-quality 3D pathology datasets on a consistent basis is non-trivial, requiring careful attention to many details regarding tissue preparation, imaging, and data/image processing in an iterative process. Here we provide an end-to-end protocol covering all aspects of a 3D pathology workflow (using light-sheet microscopy as an illustrative imaging platform) with sufficient detail to perform well-controlled preclinical and clinical studies. While 3D pathology is compatible with diverse staining protocols and computationally generated color palettes for visual analysis, this protocol will focus on a fluorescent analog of hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E), which remains the most common stain for gold-standard diagnostic determinations. We present our guidelines for a broad range of end-users (e.g., biologists, clinical researchers, and engineers) in a simple tutorial format.\nSpatial Transcriptomics Reveals Alterations in Perivascular Macrophage Lipid Metabolism: Insights into the onset of Wooden Breast Myopathy in Broiler Chickens\nAuthors: Wang, Z.; Khondowe, P.; Brannick, E. M.; Abasht, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553989\nThis study aims to use spatial transcriptomics to characterize the cell-type-specific expression profile associated with the microscopic features observed in Wooden Breast myopathy. 1 cm3 muscle sample was dissected from the cranial part of the right pectoralis major muscle from three randomly sampled broiler chickens at 23 days post-hatch and processed with Visium Spatial Gene Expression kits (10X Genomics), followed by high-resolution imaging and sequencing on the Illumina Nextseq 2000 system. WB classification was based on histopathologic features identified. Sequence reads were aligned to the chicken reference genome (Galgal6) and mapped to histological images. Unsupervised K-means clustering and Seurat integrative analysis differentiated histologic features and their specific gene expression pattern, including lipid laden macrophages (LLM), unaffected myofibers, myositis and vasculature. In particular, LLM exhibited reprogramming of lipid metabolism with up-regulated lipid transporters and genes in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors pathway, possibly through CD36-mediated signaling. Moreover, overexpression of fatty acid binding protein 5 could enhance fatty acid uptake in adjacent veins. In myositic regions, increased expression of cathepsins may play a role in muscle homeostasis and repair by mediating lysosomal activity and apoptosis. A better knowledge of different cell-type interactions at early stages of WB is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding.\nAir Pollution Aggravates Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Acute Kidney Injury\nAuthors: Sanches, T.

Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and declined renal function. PM2.5 exerts its harmful effects on various organs through oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involves similar biological processes involved in PM2.5 toxicity and is a known risk factor for CKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on IRI-induced AKI. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered air for 12 weeks before IRI, and were euthanized 48h after IRI. Animals exposed to PM2.5 and IRI exhibited reduced glomerular filtration and impaired urine concentration ability. Moreover, they showed elevated tubular damage markers NGAL and KIM-1, along with significant tubular necrosis. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated local innate immune activation, leading to an increased infiltration of Ly6G+ granulocytes and F480+ macrophages in the kidney. This, in turn, contributed to heightened renal senescence markers and myofibroblast infiltration. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKI-induced hampered tubular function is worsened by PM2.5, leading to reduced resilience to stress, activation of aging mechanisms and early hallmarks of fibrosis. Decreasing PM2.5 and implementing preventive strategies can improve AKI patients outcome and prevent AKI progression.\nNovel Insights into the Aortic Mechanical Properties of Mice Modeling Hereditary Aortic Diseases\nAuthors: Dubacher, N.; Sugiyama, K.; Smith, J. D.; Nussbaumer, V.; Csonka, M.; Ferenczi, S.; Kovacs, K. J.; Caspar, S. M.; Lamberti, L.; Meienberg, J.; Yanagisawa, H.; Sheppard, M. B.; Matyas, G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553452\nOBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models. APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice. CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.

        <p class="abstract">This study aims to use spatial transcriptomics to characterize the cell-type-specific expression profile associated with the microscopic features observed in Wooden Breast myopathy. 1 cm3 muscle sample was dissected from the cranial part of the right pectoralis major muscle from three randomly sampled broiler chickens at 23 days post-hatch and processed with Visium Spatial Gene Expression kits (10X Genomics), followed by high-resolution imaging and sequencing on the Illumina Nextseq 2000 system. WB classification was based on histopathologic features identified. Sequence reads were aligned to the chicken reference genome (Galgal6) and mapped to histological images. Unsupervised K-means clustering and Seurat integrative analysis differentiated histologic features and their specific gene expression pattern, including lipid laden macrophages (LLM), unaffected myofibers, myositis and vasculature. In particular, LLM exhibited reprogramming of lipid metabolism with up-regulated lipid transporters and genes in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors pathway, possibly through CD36-mediated signaling. Moreover, overexpression of fatty acid binding protein 5 could enhance fatty acid uptake in adjacent veins. In myositic regions, increased expression of cathepsins may play a role in muscle homeostasis and repair by mediating lysosomal activity and apoptosis. A better knowledge of different cell-type interactions at early stages of WB is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and declined renal function. PM2.5 exerts its harmful effects on various organs through oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involves similar biological processes involved in PM2.5 toxicity and is a known risk factor for CKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on IRI-induced AKI. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered air for 12 weeks before IRI, and were euthanized 48h after IRI. Animals exposed to PM2.5 and IRI exhibited reduced glomerular filtration and impaired urine concentration ability. Moreover, they showed elevated tubular damage markers NGAL and KIM-1, along with significant tubular necrosis. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated local innate immune activation, leading to an increased infiltration of Ly6G&#43; granulocytes and F480&#43; macrophages in the kidney. This, in turn, contributed to heightened renal senescence markers and myofibroblast infiltration. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKI-induced hampered tubular function is worsened by PM2.5, leading to reduced resilience to stress, activation of aging mechanisms and early hallmarks of fibrosis. Decreasing PM2.5 and implementing preventive strategies can improve AKI patients outcome and prevent AKI progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models.

APPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice.

CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.
