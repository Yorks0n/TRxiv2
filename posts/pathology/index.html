M.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545678\nImaging platforms for generating highly multiplexed histological images are being continually developed and improved. Significant improvements have also been made in the accuracy of methods for automated cell segmentation and classification. However, less attention has focussed on the quantification and analysis of the resulting point clouds which describe the spatial coordinates of individual cells. We focus here on a particular spatial statistical method, the cross-pair correlation function (cross-PCF), which can identify positive and negative spatial correlation between cells across a range of length scales. However, limitations of the cross-PCF hinder its widespread application to multiplexed histology. For example, it can only consider relations between pairs of cells, and cells must be classified using discrete categorical labels (rather than labelling continuous labels such as stain intensity). In this paper, we present three extensions to the cross-PCF which address these limitations and permit more detailed analysis of multiplex images: Topographical Correlation Maps (TCMs) can visualise local clustering and exclusion between cells; Neighbourhood Correlation Functions (NCFs) can identify colocalisation of two or more cell types; and weighted-PCFs (wPCFs) describe spatial correlation between points with continuous (rather than discrete) labels. We apply the extended PCFs to synthetic and biological datasets in order to demonstrate the insight that they can generate. Impact statementThis paper introduces three methods for performing spatial analysis on multiplex digital pathology images. We apply the methods to synthetic datasets and regions of interest from a murine colorectal carcinoma, in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. We note that these methods have wider application to marked point pattern data from other sources.\nPredominant myosin super-relaxed state in canine myocardium with naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: Ochala, J.; Lewis, C. T. A.; Beck, T.; Iwamoto, H.; Hessel, A.; Campbell, K.; Pyle, G.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.10.532046\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a naturally occurring heart failure condition in humans and dogs, notably characterized by a reduced contractility and ejection fraction. As the identification of its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incomplete, the aim of the present study was to assess whether the molecular motor myosin and its known relaxed conformational states are altered in DCM. For that, we dissected and skinned thin cardiac strips from left ventricle obtained from six DCM Doberman Pinschers and six non-failing controls (NF). We then used a combination of Mant-ATP chase experiments and X-ray diffraction to assess both energetic and structural changes of myosin. Using the Mant-ATP chase protocol, we observed that in DCM dogs, the amount of myosin molecules in the ATP-conserving conformational state also known as super-relaxed (SRX), is significantly increased when compared with NF dogs. This alteration can be rescued by applying EMD-57033, a small molecule activating myosin. Conversely, with X-ray diffraction, we found that in DCM dogs, there is a higher proportion of myosin heads in the vicinity of actin when compared with NF dogs (1,0 to 1,1 intensity ratio). Hence, we observed an uncoupling between energetic (Mant-ATP chase) and structural (X-ray diffraction) data. Taken together, these results may indicate that in the heart of Doberman Pinschers with DCM, myosin molecules are potentially stuck in a non-sequestered but ATP-conserving SRX state, that can be counterbalanced by EMD-57033 demonstrating the potential for a myosin-centered pharmacological treatment of DCM. New \u0026 noteworthyThe key finding of the present study is that, in left ventricles of dogs with a naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy, relaxed myosin molecules favor a non-sequestered super-relaxed state potentially impairing sarcomeric contractility. This alteration is rescuable by applying a small molecule activating myosin known as EMD-57033.\nMelatonin Targets MoIcl1 and Works Synergistically with Fungicide Isoprothiolane in Rice Blast Control\nAuthors: Li, G.; Bi, R.; Li, R. j.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547317\nMelatonin-a natural harmless molecule-displays versatile roles in human health and crop disease control such as for rice blast. Rice blast, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one devastating disease of rice. Application of fungicides is one of the major measures in the control of various crop diseases. However, fungicide resistance in the pathogen and relevant environmental pollution are becoming serious problems. By screening for possible synergistic combinations, here, we discovered an eco-friendly combination for rice blast control, melatonin and the fungicide isoprothiolane. These compounds together exhibited significant synergistic inhibitory effects on vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, penetration, and plant infection by M. oryzae. The combination of melatonin and isoprothiolane reduced the effective concentration of isoprothiolane by over 10-fold as well as residual levels of isoprothiolane. Transcriptomics and lipidomics revealed that melatonin and isoprothiolane synergistically interfered with lipid metabolism by regulating many common targets, including the predicted isocitrate lyase-encoding gene MoICL1. Furthermore, we show that melatonin and isoprothiolane interact with MoIcl1 using different techniques. This study demonstrates that melatonin and isoprothiolane function synergistically and can be used to reduce the dosage and residual level of isoprothiolane, potentially contributing to the environment-friendly and sustainable control of crop diseases.\n",

Rice blast, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one devastating disease of rice. Application of fungicides is one of the major measures in the control of various crop diseases. However, fungicide resistance in the pathogen and relevant environmental pollution are becoming serious problems. By screening for possible synergistic combinations, here, we discovered an eco-friendly combination for rice blast control, melatonin and the fungicide isoprothiolane. These compounds together exhibited significant synergistic inhibitory effects on vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, penetration, and plant infection by M. oryzae. The combination of melatonin and isoprothiolane reduced the effective concentration of isoprothiolane by over 10-fold as well as residual levels of isoprothiolane. Transcriptomics and lipidomics revealed that melatonin and isoprothiolane synergistically interfered with lipid metabolism by regulating many common targets, including the predicted isocitrate lyase-encoding gene MoICL1. Furthermore, we show that melatonin and isoprothiolane interact with MoIcl1 using different techniques. This study demonstrates that melatonin and isoprothiolane function synergistically and can be used to reduce the dosage and residual level of isoprothiolane, potentially contributing to the environment-friendly and sustainable control of crop diseases.</p>
