This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nDeletion of absent in melanoma (AIM) 2 gene alters bone morphology\nAuthors: Gong, Z.; Dixit, M.; Poudel, S. B.; Yildirim, G.; Yakar, S.; Muzumdar, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574199\nAbsent in Melanoma (AIM) 2 is a gene that is induced by interferon and acts as a cytosolic sensor for double-stranded (ds) DNA. It forms the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18. Our previous research demonstrated that mice lacking AIM2 exhibit spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of AIM2 gene deletion on bone structure in adult and aged mice. Utilizing micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), we discovered that female mice lacking AIM2 showed an increase in the total cross-sectional area at 5 months of age, accompanied by an increase in cortical thickness in the mid-diaphysis of the femur at both 5 and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, the cortical bone mineral density (BMD) significantly decreased in AIM2 null females compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In AIM2 null mice, both trabecular bone volume and BMD at the distal metaphysis of the femur significantly decreased at 5 and 15 months of age. Similarly, micro-CT analysis of the L4 vertebra revealed significant decreases in trabecular bone volume and BMD in aged AIM2 null females compared to WT mice. Histological examination of femurs from aged mice demonstrated increased bone marrow adiposity in AIM2 null mice, accompanied by a significant increase in CD45-/CD31-/Sca1+/Pdgfa+ adipose progenitor cells, and a decrease in the ratio of CD31-/CD31+ osteogenic progenitor cells, as determined by flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Our findings suggest that AIM2 deficiency affects bone health by promoting adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and inducing a pro-inflammatory environment, potentially contributing to the decreased bone mineral density.\n",
