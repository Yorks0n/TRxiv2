S.; Vitkovski, T.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296400\nObjectives: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI. Its extensive knowledge and unique interactive capabilities enable it to be utilized in various innovative ways in the medical field such as writing clinical notes, simplifying radiology reports. Through this study we aim to analyze its pathology knowledge to advocate its role in transforming pathology education. Methods: American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Resident Question bank (RQB) 2022 was used to test ChatGPT v4. Practice tests were created in each sub-category and were answered based on the input provided by ChatGPT. Questions that required interpretation of images were excluded. ChatGPTs performance was analyzed and compared with the average peer performance. Results: The overall performance of ChatGPT was 56.98%, lower than that of the average peer performance of 62.81%. ChatGPT performed better on clinical pathology (60.42%) than anatomic pathology (54.94%). Furthermore, its performance was better on easy questions (68.47%) compared to intermediate (52.88%) and difficult questions (37.21%). Conclusions: ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable resource in pathology education if trained on a larger, specialized medical dataset. Relying on it solely for the purpose of pathology training should be with caution, in its current form.\nTRENDS IN CLINICAL STAGE AT PRESENTATION FOR FOUR COMMON ADULT CANCERS IN IBADAN, NIGERIA\nAuthors: Omigbodun, A. O.; Agboola, A. D.; Fayehun, O. A.; Ajisola, M.; Oladejo, A.; Popoola, O.; Lilford, R. J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295952\nIntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria. MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch. ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.\niQC: machine-learning-driven prediction of surgical procedure uncovers systematic confounds of cancer whole slide images in specific medical centers\nAuthors: Schaumberg, A. J.; Lewis, M. S.; Nazarian, R.; Wadhwa, A.; Kane, N.; Turner, G.; Karnam, P.; Devineni, P.; Wolfe, N.; Kintner, R.; Rettig, M. B.; Knudsen, B. S.; Garraway, I. P.; Pyarajan, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295798\nProblemThe past decades have yielded an explosion of research using artificial intelligence for cancer detection and diagnosis in the field of computational pathology. Yet, an often unspoken assumption of this research is that a glass microscopy slide faithfully represents the underlying disease. Here we show systematic failure modes may dominate the slides digitized from a given medical center, such that neither the whole slide images nor the glass slides are suitable for rendering a diagnosis. MethodsWe quantitatively define high quality data as a set of whole slide images where the type of surgery the patient received may be accurately predicted by an automated system such as ours, called \"iQC\". We find iQC accurately distinguished biopsies from nonbiopsies, e.g. prostatectomies or transurethral resections (TURPs, a.k.a. prostate chips), only when the data qualitatively appeared to be high quality, e.g. vibrant histopathology stains and minimal artifacts. Crucially, prostate needle biopsies appear as thin strands of tissue, whereas prostatectomies and TURPs appear as larger rectangular blocks of tissue. Therefore, when the data are of high quality, iQC (i) accurately classifies pixels as tissue, (ii) accurately generates statistics that describe the distribution of tissue in a slide, and (iii) accurately predicts surgical procedure. ResultsWhile we do not control any medical centers protocols for making or storing slides, we developed the iQC tool to hold all medical centers and datasets to the same objective standard of quality. We validate this standard across five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and the Automated Gleason Grading Challenge (AGGC) 2022 public dataset. For our surgical procedure prediction task, we report an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.9966-1.000 at the VAMCs that consistently produce high quality data and AUROC of 0.9824 for the AGGC dataset. In contrast, we report an AUROC of 0.7115 at the VAMC that consistently produced poor quality data. An attending pathologist determined poor data quality was likely driven by faded histopathology stains and protocol differences among VAMCs. Specifically, this VAMC produced slides entirely by hand, whereas all other VAMCs leveraged automated methods to produce slides. ConclusionOur surgical procedure prediction AUROC may be a quantitative indicator positively associated with high data quality at a medical center or for a specific dataset. To produce high quality data, we recommend producing slides using robotics or other forms of automation whenever possible. We recommend scanning slides digitally before the glass slide has time to develop signs of age, e.g faded stains and acrylamide bubbles. To our knowledge, iQC is the first automated system in computational pathology that validates data quality against objective evidence, e.g. surgical procedure data available in the EHR or LIMS, which requires zero efforts or annotations from anatomic pathologists.\nScaling use of the rust fungus Puccinia punctiformis for biological control of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.): First report on a U.S. statewide effort\nAuthors: Bean, D. W.; Gladem, K.; Rosen, K.; Blake, A.; Clark, R. E.; Henderson, C.; Kaltenbach, J.; Price, J.; Smallwood, E. L.; Berner, D. K.; Young, S. L.; Schaeffer, R. N.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560232\nCanada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., CT) is one of the worst weeds threatening temperate regions of the world. A host-specific rust fungus, Puccinia punctiformis (F. Strauss) Rohl., is known to cause systemic disease of CT, ultimately killing individuals and reducing stand densities. In 2013, it was demonstrated that fall inoculation of rosettes with coarsely ground leaves bearing P. punctiformis telia can successfully initiate epiphytotics. In the same year, a cooperative project between the Colorado Department of Agriculture and United States Department of Agriculture was initiated, in which CT patches across the state of Colorado (USA) were inoculated and tracked over subsequent years for changes in stem density. Here, we report our findings from 8 years (2014-2021) of monitoring effort. At most sites (N = 87), CT stem densities declined, from a mean (+/- SE) of 87.9 (+/- 6.5) stems to 44.7 (+/- 4.2). These declines however were spatially-autocorrelated, and likely attributable to local growing conditions, as mean annual daily maximum temperature and standard deviation of elevation, as well as climatic conditions around the times of both treatment and monitoring, were found to be important predictors of CT decline. Further, we observed that the amount of inoculum deployed, timing since last release, and method in which it was spread locally at a site were also associated with the magnitude of CT stem decline. These results are indicative of the value of P. punctiformis as a CT biological control agent. The name Cirsium arvense dieback (CADB) is proposed herein to describe the agriculturally important decline in CT stem densities attributable to this previously un-named systemic disease.\nObesity-elicited macrophages shape CD9hi progenitor fate to promote adipose tissue fibrosis and dysfunction\nAuthors: Askia, H.; Dussaud, S.; Chaves de Oliveira, M.; Oliveira, A.; Poupel, L.; Rebiere, C.; Ouhachi, M.; Manuel, R.; Merabtene, F.; Genser, L.; Aron-Wisnewsky, J.; Moreau, M.; Yvan-Charvet, L.; Ferreira, A.; Huby, T.; Clement, K.; Marcelin, G.; Gautier, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559540\nObesity is a life-threatening condition characterized by a maladaptive remodeling of the visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT), including fibrosis, that drives vWAT metabolic alterations. We previously identified CD9hi adipose tissue progenitors as the main drivers of vWAT fibrosis in mice and humans. However, how their functions are controlled, especially by macrophages, remains largely unknown. We found that obesity-elicited monocyte-derived macrophages (obeMac) accumulation was considerably elevated in mice prone to obesity-induced vWAT fibrosis. Limiting obeMac build-up decreased the numbers and fibrogenic activation of CD9hi progenitors, leading to decreased vWAT fibrosis and improved glucose homeostasis. In patients with obesity, we identified macrophages similar to mouse obeMacs that were associated with accumulation of CD9hi progenitors in the vWAT and loss of glycemic control. Finally, intercellular communication analysis identified mediators produced by obeMacs that control the fibrogenic potential of CD9hi progenitors. Together, we uncovered an obeMac-CD9hi progenitors axis controlling vWAT fibrosis and dysfunction.\nOld foe, new host: epidemiology, genetic diversity and pathogenic characterization of maize streak virus in rice fields from Burkina Faso.\nAuthors: Fouad, N. M. I.; Barro, M.; Bangratz, M.; Sereme, D.; Filloux, D.; Fernandez, E.; Julian, C.; Saibou, N.; Kassankogno, A. I.; Guigma, A. K.; Roumagnac, P.; Wonni, I.; Tollenaere, C.; Poulicard, N.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560455\nRice is of critical significance regarding food security worldwide including in Africa. Only two viruses impacting rice production in Africa have been deeply investigated for decades: the rice yellow mottle virus (Solemoviridae) and the rice stripe necrosis virus (Benyviridae). Using viral metagenomics, we aimed at exploring the diversity of viruses circulating in Burkina Faso rice fields. We performed an epidemiological survey in this country between 2016 and 2019 involving 57 small farmer's rice fields under two production systems (rainfed lowlands and irrigated areas). More than 2700 rice samples were collected without a priori (not based on symptom observation) following a regular scheme. In addition, wild and cultivated (maize and sugarcane) Poaceae growing nearby rice fields were also collected. Unexpectedly, metagenomics detected maize streak virus (MSV, Geminiviridae) in analyzed rice samples. Further molecular analyses using RCA-PCR showed that MSV is widely distributed and highly prevalent in both rainfed lowlands and irrigated rice areas. MSV-A and MSV-G strains were identified. MSV-G, exclusively identified so far in wild grasses, was the most prevalent strain while MSV-A, known to cause severe symptoms in maize, was sporadically identified. No genetic differentiation was detected between MSV isolates either infecting wild or cultivated plant species. Using infectious clones in experimental conditions, we confirmed the pathogenicity of both MSV strains on rice. Thus, in addition to contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of rice production in Africa, our results illuminate new epidemiological and pathogenic aspects of one of the most studied plant viruses with significant economic consequences in Africa.\nNEW INSIGHTS INTO THE HEPATIC IRON PHENOTYPE OF BMP6 KNOCKOUT MICE\nAuthors: BESSON, C.; WILLEMETZ, A.; LATOUR, C.; ROBERT, L.; COPPIN, H.; ROTH, M.-P.; CANONNE-HERGAUX, F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559941\nObjective: Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and Methods: Livers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. Results: In Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. Conclusions: Unregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporter's iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.\nThe Intricate Relationship of G-Quadruplexes and Pathogenicity Islands: A Window into Bacterial Pathogenicity\nAuthors: Lyu, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548048\nThe dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4s and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in infectious diseases.\nLoss of embryonically-derived Kupffer cells during hypercholesterolemia accelerates atherosclerosis development\nAuthors: Fima, R.; Dussaud, S.; Benbida, C.; Blanchet, M.; Lanthiez, F.; Poupel, L.; Brambilla, C.; Moreau, M.; Boissonnas, A.; Gautier, E.; Huby, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559586\nHypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases. The liver plays a key role in the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels and hosts a large population of tissue-resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs). KCs are located in the hepatic sinusoids where they ensure key functions including blood immune surveillance. However, how KCs homeostasis is affected by the build-up of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins that occurs in the circulation during hypercholesterolemia remains unknown. Here, we found that embryo-derived KCs (EmKCs) accumulated large amounts of lipoprotein- derived cholesterol, in part through the scavenger receptor CD36, and massively expanded early after the induction of hypercholesterolemia. After this rapid adaptive response, EmKCs exhibited mitochondrial oxidative stress and their numbers gradually diminished while monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) with reduced cholesterol-loading capacities seeded the KC pool. Decreased proportion of EmKCs in the KC pool enhanced liver cholesterol content and exacerbated hypercholesterolemia, leading to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development. Together, our data reveal that KC homeostasis is perturbed during hypercholesterolemia, which in turn alters the control of plasma cholesterol levels and increases atherosclerosis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objectives: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI. Its extensive knowledge and unique interactive capabilities enable it to be utilized in various innovative ways in the medical field such as writing clinical notes, simplifying radiology reports. Through this study we aim to analyze its pathology knowledge to advocate its role in transforming pathology education. Methods: American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Resident Question bank (RQB) 2022 was used to test ChatGPT v4. Practice tests were created in each sub-category and were answered based on the input provided by ChatGPT. Questions that required interpretation of images were excluded. ChatGPTs performance was analyzed and compared with the average peer performance. Results: The overall performance of ChatGPT was 56.98%, lower than that of the average peer performance of 62.81%. ChatGPT performed better on clinical pathology (60.42%) than anatomic pathology (54.94%). Furthermore, its performance was better on easy questions (68.47%) compared to intermediate (52.88%) and difficult questions (37.21%). Conclusions: ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable resource in pathology education if trained on a larger, specialized medical dataset. Relying on it solely for the purpose of pathology training should be with caution, in its current form.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionCancer outcome is largely determined by stage at diagnosis. We hypothesised that people living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries may be reaching diagnosis at an early stage, reflecting growth in awareness of the disease and its symptoms. We examined stage at diagnosis for four common cancers presenting at a referral centre in Nigeria.

MethodsA retrospective review of case-records from cases treated for four common cancers (colorectal, uterine cervix, breast and prostate) at University College Hospital, Ibadan over two epochs: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018.

ResultsThere is no evidence that cases were diagnosed at an earlier stage in the later epoch. Seventy-five percent of cases were diagnosed at late stage (III or IV) in the second epoch, vs seventy percent in the first epoch.

ConclusionThere is no evidence in the data that the problem of late presentation of common cancers is reducing in Oyo State, Nigeria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ProblemThe past decades have yielded an explosion of research using artificial intelligence for cancer detection and diagnosis in the field of computational pathology. Yet, an often unspoken assumption of this research is that a glass microscopy slide faithfully represents the underlying disease. Here we show systematic failure modes may dominate the slides digitized from a given medical center, such that neither the whole slide images nor the glass slides are suitable for rendering a diagnosis.

MethodsWe quantitatively define high quality data as a set of whole slide images where the type of surgery the patient received may be accurately predicted by an automated system such as ours, called &#34;iQC&#34;. We find iQC accurately distinguished biopsies from nonbiopsies, e.g. prostatectomies or transurethral resections (TURPs, a.k.a. prostate chips), only when the data qualitatively appeared to be high quality, e.g. vibrant histopathology stains and minimal artifacts. Crucially, prostate needle biopsies appear as thin strands of tissue, whereas prostatectomies and TURPs appear as larger rectangular blocks of tissue. Therefore, when the data are of high quality, iQC (i) accurately classifies pixels as tissue, (ii) accurately generates statistics that describe the distribution of tissue in a slide, and (iii) accurately predicts surgical procedure.

ResultsWhile we do not control any medical centers protocols for making or storing slides, we developed the iQC tool to hold all medical centers and datasets to the same objective standard of quality. We validate this standard across five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and the Automated Gleason Grading Challenge (AGGC) 2022 public dataset. For our surgical procedure prediction task, we report an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.9966-1.000 at the VAMCs that consistently produce high quality data and AUROC of 0.9824 for the AGGC dataset. In contrast, we report an AUROC of 0.7115 at the VAMC that consistently produced poor quality data. An attending pathologist determined poor data quality was likely driven by faded histopathology stains and protocol differences among VAMCs. Specifically, this VAMC produced slides entirely by hand, whereas all other VAMCs leveraged automated methods to produce slides.

ConclusionOur surgical procedure prediction AUROC may be a quantitative indicator positively associated with high data quality at a medical center or for a specific dataset. To produce high quality data, we recommend producing slides using robotics or other forms of automation whenever possible. We recommend scanning slides digitally before the glass slide has time to develop signs of age, e.g faded stains and acrylamide bubbles. To our knowledge, iQC is the first automated system in computational pathology that validates data quality against objective evidence, e.g. surgical procedure data available in the EHR or LIMS, which requires zero efforts or annotations from anatomic pathologists.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., CT) is one of the worst weeds threatening temperate regions of the world. A host-specific rust fungus, Puccinia punctiformis (F. Strauss) Rohl., is known to cause systemic disease of CT, ultimately killing individuals and reducing stand densities. In 2013, it was demonstrated that fall inoculation of rosettes with coarsely ground leaves bearing P. punctiformis telia can successfully initiate epiphytotics. In the same year, a cooperative project between the Colorado Department of Agriculture and United States Department of Agriculture was initiated, in which CT patches across the state of Colorado (USA) were inoculated and tracked over subsequent years for changes in stem density. Here, we report our findings from 8 years (2014-2021) of monitoring effort. At most sites (N = 87), CT stem densities declined, from a mean (&#43;/- SE) of 87.9 (&#43;/- 6.5) stems to 44.7 (&#43;/- 4.2). These declines however were spatially-autocorrelated, and likely attributable to local growing conditions, as mean annual daily maximum temperature and standard deviation of elevation, as well as climatic conditions around the times of both treatment and monitoring, were found to be important predictors of CT decline. Further, we observed that the amount of inoculum deployed, timing since last release, and method in which it was spread locally at a site were also associated with the magnitude of CT stem decline. These results are indicative of the value of P. punctiformis as a CT biological control agent. The name Cirsium arvense dieback (CADB) is proposed herein to describe the agriculturally important decline in CT stem densities attributable to this previously un-named systemic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a life-threatening condition characterized by a maladaptive remodeling of the visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT), including fibrosis, that drives vWAT metabolic alterations. We previously identified CD9hi adipose tissue progenitors as the main drivers of vWAT fibrosis in mice and humans. However, how their functions are controlled, especially by macrophages, remains largely unknown. We found that obesity-elicited monocyte-derived macrophages (obeMac) accumulation was considerably elevated in mice prone to obesity-induced vWAT fibrosis. Limiting obeMac build-up decreased the numbers and fibrogenic activation of CD9hi progenitors, leading to decreased vWAT fibrosis and improved glucose homeostasis. In patients with obesity, we identified macrophages similar to mouse obeMacs that were associated with accumulation of CD9hi progenitors in the vWAT and loss of glycemic control. Finally, intercellular communication analysis identified mediators produced by obeMacs that control the fibrogenic potential of CD9hi progenitors. Together, we uncovered an obeMac-CD9hi progenitors axis controlling vWAT fibrosis and dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rice is of critical significance regarding food security worldwide including in Africa. Only two viruses impacting rice production in Africa have been deeply investigated for decades: the rice yellow mottle virus (Solemoviridae) and the rice stripe necrosis virus (Benyviridae). Using viral metagenomics, we aimed at exploring the diversity of viruses circulating in Burkina Faso rice fields. We performed an epidemiological survey in this country between 2016 and 2019 involving 57 small farmer&#39;s rice fields under two production systems (rainfed lowlands and irrigated areas). More than 2700 rice samples were collected without a priori (not based on symptom observation) following a regular scheme. In addition, wild and cultivated (maize and sugarcane) Poaceae growing nearby rice fields were also collected. Unexpectedly, metagenomics detected maize streak virus (MSV, Geminiviridae) in analyzed rice samples. Further molecular analyses using RCA-PCR showed that MSV is widely distributed and highly prevalent in both rainfed lowlands and irrigated rice areas. MSV-A and MSV-G strains were identified. MSV-G, exclusively identified so far in wild grasses, was the most prevalent strain while MSV-A, known to cause severe symptoms in maize, was sporadically identified. No genetic differentiation was detected between MSV isolates either infecting wild or cultivated plant species. Using infectious clones in experimental conditions, we confirmed the pathogenicity of both MSV strains on rice. Thus, in addition to contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of rice production in Africa, our results illuminate new epidemiological and pathogenic aspects of one of the most studied plant viruses with significant economic consequences in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice progressively accumulate a significant amount of iron in their liver as they age due to a defect in hepcidin (Hamp) expression and an upregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the hepatic iron overload phenotype, with specific emphasis on the cellular and subcellular localization of Fpn in Bmp6 KO mice. Materials and Methods: Livers obtained from Bmp6 knockout (KO) mice at different developmental stages were utilized for the quantification of iron content, investigation of iron distribution, histological analysis, histoimmunofluorescence assays performed on paraffin-embedded sections, confocal microscopy examinations, subcellular membrane fractionation, and western blot analysis. Results: In Bmp6 KO livers, iron overload increased with age and was not homogeneous, with certain hepatic lobes and specific areas in liver sections showing more pronounced iron accumulation. In young mice, iron accumulated mostly in the centrilobular zone where low Fpn expression was observed. Fpn was strongly detected in periportal Kupffer cells and at the apical membrane of periportal hepatocytes lining the sinusoidal capillaries. The zonal distribution of iron tended to disappear with age in strongly iron-overloaded areas, with the appearance of large cellular aggregates strongly positive for Fpn, iron, and ceroid/lipofuscin. At the subcellular level, hepatic Fpn seemed to concentrate in specific cell surface compartments and was enriched in a lipid raft fraction. Conclusions: Unregulated expression of Fpn on the cell surface of periportal macrophages and hepatocytes results in centrilobular iron overload within hepatocytes. In areas of pronounced iron overload, Fpn expression is present in lipogranulomas, identified as aggregations of macrophages accumulating hemosiderin and ceroid/lipofuscin pigments. These lesions likely form due to the phagocytosis of sideronecrotic/ferroptotic hepatocytes by macrophages. In contrast to the duodenal form of Fpn, both splenic and hepatic Fpn demonstrated robust enrichment within lipid rafts. The observed variations in the subcellular localization of Fpn could play a significant role in influencing the transporter&#39;s iron transport activity and/or its regulation by hepcidin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dynamic interplay between guanine-quadruplex (G4) structures and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) represents a captivating area of research with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale dataset from reported 89 pathogenic strains to investigate the potential interactions between G4 structures and PAIs. G4 structures exhibited an uneven and non-random distribution within the PAIs and were consistently conserved within the same pathogenic strains. Additionally, this investigation identified positive correlations between the number and frequency of G4s and the GC content across different genomic features, including the genome, promoters, genes, tRNA, and rRNA regions, indicating a potential relationship between G4 structures and the GC-associated regions of the genome. The observed differences in GC content between PAIs and the core genome further highlight the unique nature of PAIs and underlying factors, such as DNA topology. High-confidence G4 structures within regulatory regions of Escherichia coli were identified, modulating the efficiency or specificity of DNA integration events within PAIs. Collectively, these findings pave the way for future research to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms and functional implications of G4-PAI interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and the role of G4 structures in infectious diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases. The liver plays a key role in the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels and hosts a large population of tissue-resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs). KCs are located in the hepatic sinusoids where they ensure key functions including blood immune surveillance. However, how KCs homeostasis is affected by the build-up of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins that occurs in the circulation during hypercholesterolemia remains unknown. Here, we found that embryo-derived KCs (EmKCs) accumulated large amounts of lipoprotein- derived cholesterol, in part through the scavenger receptor CD36, and massively expanded early after the induction of hypercholesterolemia. After this rapid adaptive response, EmKCs exhibited mitochondrial oxidative stress and their numbers gradually diminished while monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) with reduced cholesterol-loading capacities seeded the KC pool. Decreased proportion of EmKCs in the KC pool enhanced liver cholesterol content and exacerbated hypercholesterolemia, leading to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development. Together, our data reveal that KC homeostasis is perturbed during hypercholesterolemia, which in turn alters the control of plasma cholesterol levels and increases atherosclerosis.</p>
