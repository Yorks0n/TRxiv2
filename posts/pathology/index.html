M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545678\nImaging platforms for generating highly multiplexed histological images are being continually developed and improved. Significant improvements have also been made in the accuracy of methods for automated cell segmentation and classification. However, less attention has focussed on the quantification and analysis of the resulting point clouds which describe the spatial coordinates of individual cells. We focus here on a particular spatial statistical method, the cross-pair correlation function (cross-PCF), which can identify positive and negative spatial correlation between cells across a range of length scales. However, limitations of the cross-PCF hinder its widespread application to multiplexed histology. For example, it can only consider relations between pairs of cells, and cells must be classified using discrete categorical labels (rather than labelling continuous labels such as stain intensity). In this paper, we present three extensions to the cross-PCF which address these limitations and permit more detailed analysis of multiplex images: Topographical Correlation Maps (TCMs) can visualise local clustering and exclusion between cells; Neighbourhood Correlation Functions (NCFs) can identify colocalisation of two or more cell types; and weighted-PCFs (wPCFs) describe spatial correlation between points with continuous (rather than discrete) labels. We apply the extended PCFs to synthetic and biological datasets in order to demonstrate the insight that they can generate. Impact statementThis paper introduces three methods for performing spatial analysis on multiplex digital pathology images. We apply the methods to synthetic datasets and regions of interest from a murine colorectal carcinoma, in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. We note that these methods have wider application to marked point pattern data from other sources.\nAlternative protocols of tissue fixation dramatically reduces the impact of DNA artifacts, unraveling the interpretation of clinical Comprehensive Genomic Profiling\nAuthors: Berrino, E.; Bellomo, S. E.; Chesta, A.; Detillo, P.; Bragoni, A.; Gagliardi, A.; Naccarati, A.; Cereda, M.; Witel, G.; Sapino, A.; Bussolati, B.; Bussolati, G. P.; Marchio, C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.23291533\nFormalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples represent the cornerstone of tissue-based analysis in precision medicine. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels are routinely used to analyze a limited number of genes to guide treatment decision making for advanced stage patients. The number and complexity of genetic alterations to be investigated are rapidly growing, in several instances a comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) analysis is required. The poor quality of genetic material extracted from FFPE samples may impact the feasibility/reliability of sequencing data. We sampled 9 colorectal cancers to allow 4 parallel fixations: i) neutral buffered formalin (NBF); ii) acid-deprived formalin fixation (ADF); iii) pre-cooled ADF (coldADF); iv) Glyoxal Acid-Free (GAF). DNA extraction, fragmentation analysis and sequencing by using two large NGS panels (OCAv3, TSO500) followed. We comprehensively analyzed library and sequencing QCs, and the quality of sequencing results. Libraries from coldADF samples showed significantly longer reads than the others with both panels. ADF and coldADF derived libraries showed the lowest level of noise and the highest levels of uniformity with the OCAv3 panel, followed by GAF and NBF samples. The data uniformity was confirmed by TSO500 results, which also highlighted the best performance in terms of total region sequenced for ADF and coldADF samples. NBF samples had a significantly smaller region sequenced, displayed a significantly lower number of evaluable MS loci and a significant increase in SNVs compared to other protocols. The mutational Signature 1 (aging-, FFPE artifact-related) showed the highest (37%) and the lowest (17%) values in NBF and coldADF samples, respectively. Most of identified genetic alterations were shared by all samples in each lesion. Five genes showed a different mutational status across samples and/or panels: four discordant results involved NBF samples. In conclusion, acid-deprived fixatives guarantee the highest DNA preservation/sequencing performance, suggesting possible implementation of even more complex molecular profiling on tissue samples.\nClinical Significance of the Stromatic Component in Ovarian Cancer: Quantity Over Quality in Outcome Prediction\nAuthors: Lou, E.; Clemente, V.; Grube, M.; Svedbom, A.; Nelson, A. C.; Blome, F.; Staebler, A.; Kommoss, S.; Bazzaro, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546712\nBackground: The tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer. Methods: This study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H\u0026E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors. Results: We found that high TSP (\u003e50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644. Conclusions: In HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.\nHistone deacetylase 3 plays a critical role in hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis\nAuthors: An, C.; Jiao, B.; Du, H.; Tran, M.; Song, B.; Wang, P.; Hu, Z.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Y.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546796\nObjective: Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. The molecular mechanisms how hypertension causes kidney disease are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease. Approach and Results: Myeloid HDAC3 knockout mice were generated by crossing HDAC3f/f mice with LysM-Cre+/- mice. Both LysM-Cre-/-HDAC3f/f (HDAC3CON) mice and LysM-Cre+/+HDAC3f/f (HDAC3MKO) mice were subjected to uninephrectomy and treated with angiotensin II at 1.5 ug/kg/min or vehicle for 28 days. Blood pressure increased comparably in both HDAC3CON and HDAC3MKO mice following angiotensin II treatment. Compared with HDAC3CON mice, HDAC3MKO mice were protected from angiotensin II-induced kidney dysfunction and pathological injury and developed less proteinuria. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency markedly attenuated the protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, and ?-SMA in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. Furthermore, HDAC3MKO mice accumulated significantly fewer myeloid fibroblasts and macrophages in the kidney after angiotensin II treatment. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency significantly reduced the mRNA expression of proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. In cultured macrophages, knockdown of HDAC3 with shRNA suppressed proinflammatory molecule expression. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC3 inhibited NF-kB p65 enrichment to IL-6 promoter. Conclusion: Our study identifies a critical role of myeloid HDAC3 in the regulation of hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting HDAC3 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertensive kidney disease.\nObserver-rated outcomes of Communication-Centered Treatment (CCT) for adults who stutter: A preliminary study\nAuthors: Byrd, C. T.; Coalson, G.; Werle, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23290720\nPrevious studies have reported that adults who stutter demonstrate significant gains in communication competence, per self-ratings and clinician-ratings, upon completion of a communication-centered treatment, or CCT. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether gains in communication competence would also be reported by untrained observers. Eighty-one untrained observers completed an online survey that required each to view one of two videos depicting an adult who stutters during a mock interview recorded prior to CCT or after CCT. Participants were then asked to rate the communication competence of the interviewee on a 100-point visual analog scale and provide additional demographic information. Communication competence of the adult who stutters was rated significantly higher in their post-treatment video. Two observer-based factors were significantly associated with ratings of communication competence: years of education and years the respondent had known an adult who stutters. Upon controlling for these demographic factors, significantly higher ratings of communication competence for the post-treatment video were maintained. Although preliminary, findings suggest gains in communication competence demonstrated in previous studies through clinician and client observations are not limited to the sterile clinical environment, and further emphasizes the ecological validity of CCT.

F.; Quillfeldt, P.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545710\nAvian haemosporidians are vector-borne blood parasites, which infect a great variety of avian host species. The order Passeriformes has the highest average infection probability; nevertheless, some common species of this order have been rather poorly studied in terms of haemosporidian prevalence and diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of haemosporidians in one of such species, the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (Corvidae), from a forest population in Hesse, Central Germany. All individuals were infected with at least one haemosporidian genus, i.e. an overall prevalence of 100%. The most common infection pattern was a mixed infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas no Plasmodium infection was detected. Our results regarding lineage diversity combined with data from other studies indicate a rather pronounced host-specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages infecting birds of the family Corvidae.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Imaging platforms for generating highly multiplexed histological images are being continually developed and improved. Significant improvements have also been made in the accuracy of methods for automated cell segmentation and classification. However, less attention has focussed on the quantification and analysis of the resulting point clouds which describe the spatial coordinates of individual cells. We focus here on a particular spatial statistical method, the cross-pair correlation function (cross-PCF), which can identify positive and negative spatial correlation between cells across a range of length scales. However, limitations of the cross-PCF hinder its widespread application to multiplexed histology. For example, it can only consider relations between pairs of cells, and cells must be classified using discrete categorical labels (rather than labelling continuous labels such as stain intensity).

        <p class="abstract">Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples represent the cornerstone of tissue-based analysis in precision medicine. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels are routinely used to analyze a limited number of genes to guide treatment decision making for advanced stage patients. The number and complexity of genetic alterations to be investigated are rapidly growing, in several instances a comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) analysis is required. The poor quality of genetic material extracted from FFPE samples may impact the feasibility/reliability of sequencing data.

We sampled 9 colorectal cancers to allow 4 parallel fixations: i) neutral buffered formalin (NBF); ii) acid-deprived formalin fixation (ADF); iii) pre-cooled ADF (coldADF); iv) Glyoxal Acid-Free (GAF). DNA extraction, fragmentation analysis and sequencing by using two large NGS panels (OCAv3, TSO500) followed. We comprehensively analyzed library and sequencing QCs, and the quality of sequencing results.

Libraries from coldADF samples showed significantly longer reads than the others with both panels. ADF and coldADF derived libraries showed the lowest level of noise and the highest levels of uniformity with the OCAv3 panel, followed by GAF and NBF samples. The data uniformity was confirmed by TSO500 results, which also highlighted the best performance in terms of total region sequenced for ADF and coldADF samples. NBF samples had a significantly smaller region sequenced, displayed a significantly lower number of evaluable MS loci and a significant increase in SNVs compared to other protocols. The mutational Signature 1 (aging-, FFPE artifact-related) showed the highest (37%) and the lowest (17%) values in NBF and coldADF samples, respectively.

Most of identified genetic alterations were shared by all samples in each lesion. Five genes showed a different mutational status across samples and/or panels: four discordant results involved NBF samples.

In conclusion, acid-deprived fixatives guarantee the highest DNA preservation/sequencing performance, suggesting possible implementation of even more complex molecular profiling on tissue samples.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer. Methods: This study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H&amp;E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors. Results: We found that high TSP (&gt;50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644. Conclusions: In HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. The molecular mechanisms how hypertension causes kidney disease are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease. Approach and Results: Myeloid HDAC3 knockout mice were generated by crossing HDAC3f/f mice with LysM-Cre&#43;/- mice. Both LysM-Cre-/-HDAC3f/f (HDAC3CON) mice and LysM-Cre&#43;/&#43;HDAC3f/f (HDAC3MKO) mice were subjected to uninephrectomy and treated with angiotensin II at 1.5 ug/kg/min or vehicle for 28 days. Blood pressure increased comparably in both HDAC3CON and HDAC3MKO mice following angiotensin II treatment. Compared with HDAC3CON mice, HDAC3MKO mice were protected from angiotensin II-induced kidney dysfunction and pathological injury and developed less proteinuria. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency markedly attenuated the protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, and ?-SMA in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. Furthermore, HDAC3MKO mice accumulated significantly fewer myeloid fibroblasts and macrophages in the kidney after angiotensin II treatment. Myeloid HDAC3 deficiency significantly reduced the mRNA expression of proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following angiotensin II treatment. In cultured macrophages, knockdown of HDAC3 with shRNA suppressed proinflammatory molecule expression. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC3 inhibited NF-kB p65 enrichment to IL-6 promoter. Conclusion: Our study identifies a critical role of myeloid HDAC3 in the regulation of hypertension-induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting HDAC3 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertensive kidney disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previous studies have reported that adults who stutter demonstrate significant gains in communication competence, per self-ratings and clinician-ratings, upon completion of a communication-centered treatment, or CCT. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether gains in communication competence would also be reported by untrained observers. Eighty-one untrained observers completed an online survey that required each to view one of two videos depicting an adult who stutters during a mock interview recorded prior to CCT or after CCT. Participants were then asked to rate the communication competence of the interviewee on a 100-point visual analog scale and provide additional demographic information. Communication competence of the adult who stutters was rated significantly higher in their post-treatment video. Two observer-based factors were significantly associated with ratings of communication competence: years of education and years the respondent had known an adult who stutters. Upon controlling for these demographic factors, significantly higher ratings of communication competence for the post-treatment video were maintained. Although preliminary, findings suggest gains in communication competence demonstrated in previous studies through clinician and client observations are not limited to the sterile clinical environment, and further emphasizes the ecological validity of CCT.

        <p class="abstract">Avian haemosporidians are vector-borne blood parasites, which infect a great variety of avian host species. The order Passeriformes has the highest average infection probability; nevertheless, some common species of this order have been rather poorly studied in terms of haemosporidian prevalence and diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of haemosporidians in one of such species, the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (Corvidae), from a forest population in Hesse, Central Germany. All individuals were infected with at least one haemosporidian genus, i.e. an overall prevalence of 100%. The most common infection pattern was a mixed infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas no Plasmodium infection was detected. Our results regarding lineage diversity combined with data from other studies indicate a rather pronounced host-specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages infecting birds of the family Corvidae.</p>
