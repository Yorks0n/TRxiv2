It offers unprecedented opportunities for improved efficiency in treatment decisions by allowing pathologists to achieve higher precision and objectivity in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First, we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in the literature. This paves the way for the development of a foundation model for histopathology.\nProtective role of N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide on endothelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Rajewska-Tabor, J.; Sosinska, P.; Pyda, M.; Breborowicz, A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549800\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes hyperinflammation and activation of coagulation cascade and in the result aggravates endothelial cell dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum collected after 4+/-1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue Plasminogen Activator and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with N-acetylocysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor. No changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Sulodexide can also play a protective role in post-COVID-19 patients.\nIn situ cryo-electron tomography of beta-amyloid and tau in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain\nAuthors: Gilbert, M. A. G.; Fatima, N.; Jenkins, J.; O'Sullivan, T. J.; Schertel, A.; Halfon, Y.; Morrema, T. H. J.; Geibel, M.; Radford, S. E.; Hoozemans, J. J. M.; Frank, R. A. W.\nScore: 59.9, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549278\nA defining pathological feature of most neurodegenerative diseases is the assembly of proteins into amyloid that form disease-specific structures. In Alzheimers disease (AD) this is characterised by the deposition of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau with AD-specific conformations. The in situ structure of amyloid in the human brain is unknown. Here, using cryogenic fluorescence microscopy (cryoFM)-targeted cryo-sectioning, cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryoFIB-SEM) liftout and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), we determined the in-tissue structure of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology in fresh post-mortem AD donor brain. {beta}-amyloid plaques contained a mixture of fibrils and protofilaments arranged in parallel arrays and lattice-like structures, some of which were branched. Extracellular vesicles, extracellular droplets and open lipid bilayer sheets defined non-amyloid constituents of amyloid plaques. In contrast, tau inclusions were characterised by clusters of unbranched filaments. Subtomogram averaging of filaments within each cluster revealed distinct structures including variably twisted paired helical filaments (PHF) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-like tau filaments that were situated [~]1 m apart within two microscopic regions of pathology. Filaments within a cluster were similar to each other, but different between clusters, showing that fibril heterogeneity is spatially organised and influenced by the subcellular tissue environment. The in situ structural approaches outlined here for targeting specific proteins within human donor tissues have applications to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.\nGlycoprotein VI is Critical for the Detection and Progression of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\nAuthors: Benson, T.

E.; Mackman, N.; Cameron, S. J.; Owens, A. P.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547361\nA common feature in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is the formation of a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in regions of aortic dilation. Platelets are known to maintain hemostasis and propagate thrombosis through several redundant activation mechanisms, yet the role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of AAA associated ILT is still poorly understood. Thus, we sought to investigate how platelet activation impacts the pathogenesis of AAA. Using RNA-sequencing, we identify that the platelet-associated transcripts are significantly enriched in the ILT compared to the adjacent aneurysm wall and healthy control aortas. We found that the platelet specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is among the top enriched genes in AAA ILT and is increased on the platelet surface of AAA patients. Examination of a specific indicator of platelet activity, soluble GPVI (sGPVI), in two independent AAA patient cohorts is highly predictive of a AAA diagnosis and associates more strongly with aneurysm growth rate when compared to D-dimer in humans. Finally, intervention with the anti-GPVI antibody (J) in mice with established aneurysms blunted the progression of AAA in two independent mouse models. In conclusion, we show that levels of sGPVI in humans can predict a diagnosis of AAA and AAA growth rate, which may be critical in the identification of high-risk patients. We also identify GPVI as a novel platelet-specific AAA therapeutic target, with minimal risk of adverse bleeding complications, where none currently exist. KEY POINTSO_LISoluble glycoprotein VI, which is a platelet-derived blood biomarker, predicts a diagnosis of AAA, with high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients with fast from slow-growing AAA. C_LIO_LIBlockade of glycoprotein VI in mice with established aneurysms reduces AAA progression and mortality, indicating therapeutic potential.

N.; Field, E.; Tollit, J.; Heenan, I. K.; Barnes, A.; Taylor, M. R.; Mestroni, L.; Kaski, J. P.; Saffitz, J. E.; Asimaki, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550526\nNF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes arrhythmias and myocardial injury in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing pro-inflammatory CCR2-expressing macrophages to the heart. Based on these new mechanistic insights, we analyzed hearts of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We observed active NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes associated with marked infiltration of CCR2-expressing cells. We also observed NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells obtained from young subjects with active disease. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy may be effective in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Screening buccal cells may be a reliable way to identify patients most likely to benefit.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes hyperinflammation and activation of coagulation cascade and in the result aggravates endothelial cell dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum collected after 4&#43;/-1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue Plasminogen Activator and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with N-acetylocysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor. No changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Sulodexide can also play a protective role in post-COVID-19 patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A defining pathological feature of most neurodegenerative diseases is the assembly of proteins into amyloid that form disease-specific structures. In Alzheimers disease (AD) this is characterised by the deposition of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau with AD-specific conformations. The in situ structure of amyloid in the human brain is unknown. Here, using cryogenic fluorescence microscopy (cryoFM)-targeted cryo-sectioning, cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryoFIB-SEM) liftout and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), we determined the in-tissue structure of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology in fresh post-mortem AD donor brain. {beta}-amyloid plaques contained a mixture of fibrils and protofilaments arranged in parallel arrays and lattice-like structures, some of which were branched. Extracellular vesicles, extracellular droplets and open lipid bilayer sheets defined non-amyloid constituents of amyloid plaques. In contrast, tau inclusions were characterised by clusters of unbranched filaments. Subtomogram averaging of filaments within each cluster revealed distinct structures including variably twisted paired helical filaments (PHF) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-like tau filaments that were situated [~]1 m apart within two microscopic regions of pathology. Filaments within a cluster were similar to each other, but different between clusters, showing that fibril heterogeneity is spatially organised and influenced by the subcellular tissue environment. The in situ structural approaches outlined here for targeting specific proteins within human donor tissues have applications to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A common feature in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is the formation of a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in regions of aortic dilation. Platelets are known to maintain hemostasis and propagate thrombosis through several redundant activation mechanisms, yet the role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of AAA associated ILT is still poorly understood. Thus, we sought to investigate how platelet activation impacts the pathogenesis of AAA. Using RNA-sequencing, we identify that the platelet-associated transcripts are significantly enriched in the ILT compared to the adjacent aneurysm wall and healthy control aortas. We found that the platelet specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is among the top enriched genes in AAA ILT and is increased on the platelet surface of AAA patients. Examination of a specific indicator of platelet activity, soluble GPVI (sGPVI), in two independent AAA patient cohorts is highly predictive of a AAA diagnosis and associates more strongly with aneurysm growth rate when compared to D-dimer in humans. Finally, intervention with the anti-GPVI antibody (J) in mice with established aneurysms blunted the progression of AAA in two independent mouse models. In conclusion, we show that levels of sGPVI in humans can predict a diagnosis of AAA and AAA growth rate, which may be critical in the identification of high-risk patients. We also identify GPVI as a novel platelet-specific AAA therapeutic target, with minimal risk of adverse bleeding complications, where none currently exist.

KEY POINTSO_LISoluble glycoprotein VI, which is a platelet-derived blood biomarker, predicts a diagnosis of AAA, with high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients with fast from slow-growing AAA.
C_LIO_LIBlockade of glycoprotein VI in mice with established aneurysms reduces AAA progression and mortality, indicating therapeutic potential.

        <p class="abstract">NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes causes arrhythmias and myocardial injury in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy by mobilizing pro-inflammatory CCR2-expressing macrophages to the heart. Based on these new mechanistic insights, we analyzed hearts of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients who died suddenly or required cardiac transplantation. We observed active NF{kappa}B signaling in cardiac myocytes associated with marked infiltration of CCR2-expressing cells. We also observed NF{kappa}B signaling in buccal mucosa cells obtained from young subjects with active disease. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy may be effective in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Screening buccal cells may be a reliable way to identify patients most likely to benefit.</p>
