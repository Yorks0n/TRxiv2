G.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572180\nThe majority of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a loss in their sense of smell and accumulate insoluble -synuclein aggregates in their olfactory bulbs (OB). Subjects affected by a SARS-CoV-2-linked illness (COVID-19) frequently experience hyposmia. We previously hypothesized that -synuclein and tau misprocessing could occur following host responses to microbial triggers. Using semiquantitative measurements of immunohistochemical signals, we examined OB and olfactory tract specimens collected serially at autopsies between 2020 and 2023. Deceased subjects comprised 50 adults, which included COVID19+ patients (n=22), individuals with Lewy body disease (e.g., PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n=6)), Alzheimer disease (AD; n=3), other non-synucleinopathy-linked degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=2) and multisystem atrophy (MSA; n=1)). Further, we included neurologically healthy controls (HCO; n=9) and those with an inflammation-rich brain disorder as neurological controls (NCO; n=7). When probing for inflammatory changes focusing on anterior olfactory nuclei (AON) using anti-CD68 immunostaining, scores were consistently elevated in NCO and AD cases. In contrast, inflammation on average was not significantly altered in COVID19+ patients relative to controls, although anti-CD68 reactivity in their OB and tracts declined with progression in age. Mild-to-moderate increases in phospho-Syn and phospho-tau signals were detected in the AON of tauopathy-and synucleinopathy-afflicted brains, respectively, consistent with mixed pathology, as described by others. Lastly, when both sides were available for comparison in our case series, we saw no asymmetry in the degree of pathology of the left versus right OB and tracts. We concluded from our autopsy series that after a fatal course of COVID-19, microscopic changes -when present-in the rostral, intracranial portion of the olfactory circuitry generally reflected neurodegenerative processes seen elsewhere in the brain. In general, inflammation correlated best with the degree of Alzheimers-linked tauopathy and declined with progression of age in COVID19+ patients.\nIntegrated histopathology, spatial and single cell transcriptomics resolve cellular drivers of early and late alveolar damage in COVID-19\nAuthors: Lee, J. T. H.; Barnett, S. N.; Roberts, K.; Ashwin, H.; Milross, L.; Cho, J.-W.; Huseynov, A.; Woodhams, B.; Aivazidis, A.; Li, T.; Majo, J.; Guerrero, P. C.; Lee, M.; Miranda, A. M.

J.; Hemberg, M.; Noseda, M.; Bayraktar, O. A.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572494\nThe most common cause of death due to COVID-19 remains respiratory failure. Yet, our understanding of the precise cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of COVID-19 donor lungs with spatial transcriptomic data stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive DAD, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and depleted epithelial and endothelial populations throughout different types of tissue damage. Predicted markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in early DAD, and fibrosis-related collagens in organised DAD. Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key regulator during early DAD. These results provide the first comprehensive, spatially resolved atlas of DAD stages, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways across alveolar damage progression.\nAn Endogenous Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Ligand Induces Preeclampsia-like Phenotypes: Transcriptome, Phosphoproteome, and Cell Functions\nAuthors: Zhao, Y.-j.; Zhou, C.; Wei, Y.-y.; Zhang, S.; Mishra, J.; Li, H.; Lei, W.; Wang, K.; Kumar, S.; Zheng, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572271\nBACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is one hypertensive disorder and a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity during human pregnancy. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor, which regulates vascular development and functions. Exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands can induce hypertension in animals. However, if dysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands contributes to the pathophysiology of PE remains elusive. METHODS: We applied physiological, cellular, and molecular approaches to dissect the role of endogenous AhR ligands in vascular functions during pregnancy using pregnant rats and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as models. RESULTS: PE increased AhR antagonistic activities in human umbilical vein sera. Exposure of pregnant rats to endogenous AhR ligands, 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) increased blood pressure and proteinuria, while decreased uteroplacental blood flow and reduced fetal and placental weights, all of which are hallmarks of PE. ITE dampened vascular growth and altered immune cell infiltration in rat placentas. ITE also decreased cell proliferation and cell monolayer integrity in HUVECs in vitro. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ITE dysregulated transcriptomes in rat placentas and HUVECs in a fetal sex-specific manner. Bottom-up phosphoproteomic analysis showed that ITE disrupted phosphoproteomes in HUVECs. These ITE-dysregulated genes and phosphoproteins were enriched in biological functions and pathways which are highly relevant to diseases of heart, liver, and kidney, vascular functions, inflammation responses, cell death, and kinase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands during pregnancy may lead to the development of PE with underlying impaired vascular functions, fetal sex-specific immune cell infiltration and transcriptomes, and phosphoproteomes. Thus, this study has provided a novel mechanism for the development of PE and potentially other forms of hypertensive pregnancies as well. These AhR ligand-activated genes and phosphoproteins might represent promising therapeutic and fetal sex-specific targets for PE-impaired vascular functions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is one hypertensive disorder and a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity during human pregnancy. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor, which regulates vascular development and functions. Exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands can induce hypertension in animals. However, if dysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands contributes to the pathophysiology of PE remains elusive. METHODS: We applied physiological, cellular, and molecular approaches to dissect the role of endogenous AhR ligands in vascular functions during pregnancy using pregnant rats and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as models. RESULTS: PE increased AhR antagonistic activities in human umbilical vein sera. Exposure of pregnant rats to endogenous AhR ligands, 2-(1&#39;H-indole-3&#39;-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) increased blood pressure and proteinuria, while decreased uteroplacental blood flow and reduced fetal and placental weights, all of which are hallmarks of PE. ITE dampened vascular growth and altered immune cell infiltration in rat placentas. ITE also decreased cell proliferation and cell monolayer integrity in HUVECs in vitro. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ITE dysregulated transcriptomes in rat placentas and HUVECs in a fetal sex-specific manner. Bottom-up phosphoproteomic analysis showed that ITE disrupted phosphoproteomes in HUVECs. These ITE-dysregulated genes and phosphoproteins were enriched in biological functions and pathways which are highly relevant to diseases of heart, liver, and kidney, vascular functions, inflammation responses, cell death, and kinase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands during pregnancy may lead to the development of PE with underlying impaired vascular functions, fetal sex-specific immune cell infiltration and transcriptomes, and phosphoproteomes. Thus, this study has provided a novel mechanism for the development of PE and potentially other forms of hypertensive pregnancies as well. These AhR ligand-activated genes and phosphoproteins might represent promising therapeutic and fetal sex-specific targets for PE-impaired vascular functions.</p>
