D.-T.; Lynch, S. J.; Senatori, B.; Vieira, P.; Mejias, J.; Kumar, A.; Masonbrink, R. E.; Maier, T. R.; Baum, T.

Therefore, targeting host:parasite biology that regulates these changes in gene expression could open up routes to pathogen control. Here, we show that in the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii, host signals (termed effectostimulins) within plant roots activate the master regulator sugr1. SUGR1, then, directly binds effector promoters, and orchestrates their production. Effector production, in turn, facilitates host entry, releasing more effectostimulins. These data show that gene expression during the very earliest stages of parasitism is defined by a feed forward loop for host entry. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking SUGR1 blocks parasitism, underlining the SUGR1 signalling cascade as a valuable target for crop protection. Given that nematodes also parasitise humans and other animals, the potential impact is broad: disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.

S.; Keely, A.; Nguyen, K.; Johnson, C.; Rosenfeld, M.; Ladiges, W.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577437\nThe process of aging is defined by the breakdown of critical maintenance pathways leading to an accumulation of damage and its associated phenotypes. Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice. To test the ability of this drug cocktail to impact Alzheimer's disease (AD), an adeno-associated-viral vector model of AD was created. Mice were fed the drug cocktail 2 months prior to injection and allowed 3 months for phenotypic development. Cognitive phenotypes were evaluated through a spatial navigation learning task. To quantify neuropathology, immunohistochemistry was performed for AD proteins and pathways of aging. Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early-stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.\nMulti-V-Stain: Multiplexed Virtual Staining of Histopathology Whole-Slide Images\nAuthors: Andani, S.; Chen, B.; Ficek-Pascual, J.; Heinke, S.; Casanova, R.; Sobottka, B.; Bodenmiller, B.; The Tumor Profiler Consortium, ; Kölzer, V. H.; Rätsch, G.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301803\nPathological assessment of Hematoxylin \u0026 Eosin (H\u0026E) stained tissue samples is a well-established clinical routine for cancer diagnosis. While providing rich morphological data, it lacks information on protein expression patterns which is crucial for cancer prognosis and treatment recommendations. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) excels in highly multiplexed protein profiling but faces challenges like high operational cost and a restrictive focus on small Regions-of-Interest. Addressing this, we introduce Multi-V-Stain, a novel image-to-image translation method for multiplexed IMC virtual staining. Our method effectively utilizes the rich morphological features from H\u0026E images to predict multiplexed protein expressions at a Whole-Slide Image level. In evaluations using an in-house melanoma dataset, Multi-V-Stain consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and biological relevance of the generated stains.\nAtypia of Undetermined Significance and ThyroSeq v3 Positive Call Rates as Quality Control Metrics for Cytology Laboratory Performance\nAuthors: Mejia, O.; Bravo-Gonzalez, A.; Sanchez-Avila, M.; Tjendra, Y.; Santoscoy, R.; Drews-Elger, K.; Zuo, Y.; Arias-Abad, C.; Gomez, C.; Garcia-Buitrago, M.; Nadji, M.; Jorda, M.; Velez-Torres, J. M.; Ruiz-Cordero, R.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301631\nBackgroundThe Bethesda system (TBS) for reporting thyroid cytopathology recommends an \"atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)\" rate of 10%. Recent data suggest that this category might be overused when the rate of cases with molecular positive results is low. As a quality metric, we calculated the AUS and positive call rates for our cytology lab and each cytopathologist. MethodsA retrospective analysis of all thyroid cytology cases in a 4.5-year period was performed. Cases were stratified by TBS category, and molecular testing results were collected for indeterminate categories. The AUS rate was calculated for each cytopathologist (CP) and the laboratory. The molecular positive call rate (PCR) was calculated with and without the addition of currently negative to the positive results obtained from the ThyroSeq report. Results7,535 cases were classified as non-diagnostic 7.6%, benign 69%, AUS 17.5%, follicular neoplasm / suspicious for follicular neoplasm 1.4%, suspicious for malignancy 0.7 %, and malignant 3.8%. The AUS rate for each cytopathologist ranged from 9.9-36.8%. The overall PCR for the cytology laboratory was 24% (range 13-35.6% per CP). When including cases with currently negative results, the PCR increased to 35.5% for the cytology laboratory (range 13-42.6% per CP). Comparison analysis indicates a combination of overcalling benign cases and, less frequently, under calling of higher TBS category cases. ConclusionsThe AUS rate in the context of PCR is a useful metric to assess cytology laboratory and cytopathologists performance. Continuous feedback on this metric could help improve the overall quality of reporting thyroid cytology.\nXKidneyOnco: An Explainable Framework to Classify Renal Oncocytoma and Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma with a Small Sample Size\nAuthors: Javaheri, T.; Heidari, S.; Yang, X.; Yerra, S.; Seidi, K.; Setayesh, T.; Zhang, G.; Chitkushev, L.; Salar, S. S.; Sayeeduddin, Z.; Zarrin-Khameh, N.; Gharib, M. H.; Castro, P.; Haeri, M.; Rawassizadeh, R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576782\nRenal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma are two kidney cancer types that present a diagnostic challenge to pathologists and other clinicians due to their microscopic similarities. While RO is a benign renal neoplasm, ChRCC is considered malignant. Therefore, the differentiation between the two is crucial. In this study, we introduce an explainable framework to accurately differentiate ChRCC from RO, histologically. Our approach examined H\u0026E-stained images of 656 ChRCC and 720 RO, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%, the sensitivity of 87%, and 100% specificity for explainable AI, which either outperforms or operate on par with convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Besides, we enrolled 44 pathology experts (including pathologists and pathology trainees) to differentiate the two tumors. The average accuracy of pathologists was 73%, which is 15.2% lower than our framework. These results indicate that the combination of human expert along with explainable AI achieve higher accuracy in differentiating the two tumors, while it reduces the workload of experts and offers the desired explainability for the medical experts.\nInnate Immune Activation and Mitochondrial ROS Invoke Persistent Cardiac Conduction System Dysfunction after COVID-19\nAuthors: Ashok, D.; Liu, T.; Criscione, J.; Prakash, M.; Kim, B.; Chow, J.; Craney, M.; Papanicolaou, K.; Sidor, A.; Foster, D. B.; Pekosz, A.; Villano, J.; Kim, D.-H.; O'Rourke, B.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574280\nBackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nImpact of Mesotherapy with Sodium Deoxycholate on Liver: Metabolic- and Sex-Specific Insights in Swiss mice\nAuthors: Goncalves, L. F.; Rosa, B. R.; Ramos, I. T. T.; Feder, J. B.; Messina, J. R. M.; Barreira, R. M.; Torres, V. M.; Simoes, V. L.; Paes-de-Almeida, E. C.; Fernandes-Santos, C.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576283\nBackgroundSodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions. ObjectiveTo investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption. MethodsFemale and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression. ResultsChronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups. ConclusionDC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">All pathogens must tailor their gene expression to their environment. Therefore, targeting host:parasite biology that regulates these changes in gene expression could open up routes to pathogen control. Here, we show that in the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii, host signals (termed effectostimulins) within plant roots activate the master regulator sugr1. SUGR1, then, directly binds effector promoters, and orchestrates their production. Effector production, in turn, facilitates host entry, releasing more effectostimulins. These data show that gene expression during the very earliest stages of parasitism is defined by a feed forward loop for host entry. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking SUGR1 blocks parasitism, underlining the SUGR1 signalling cascade as a valuable target for crop protection. Given that nematodes also parasitise humans and other animals, the potential impact is broad: disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.

        <p class="abstract">The process of aging is defined by the breakdown of critical maintenance pathways leading to an accumulation of damage and its associated phenotypes. Aging affects many systems and is considered the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases. Therefore, interventions aimed at establishing resilience to aging should delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown a three-drug cocktail consisting of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate delayed the onset of physical, cognitive, and biological aging phenotypes in old mice. To test the ability of this drug cocktail to impact Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), an adeno-associated-viral vector model of AD was created. Mice were fed the drug cocktail 2 months prior to injection and allowed 3 months for phenotypic development. Cognitive phenotypes were evaluated through a spatial navigation learning task. To quantify neuropathology, immunohistochemistry was performed for AD proteins and pathways of aging. Results suggested the drug cocktail was able to increase resilience to cognitive impairment, inflammation, and AD protein aggregation while enhancing autophagy and synaptic integrity, preferentially in female cohorts. In conclusion, female mice were more susceptible to the development of early-stage AD neuropathology and learning impairment, and more responsive to treatment with the drug cocktail in comparison to male mice. Translationally, a model of AD where females are more susceptible would have greater value as women have a greater burden and incidence of disease compared to men. These findings validate past results and provide the rationale for further investigations into enhancing resilience to early-stage AD by enhancing resilience to aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathological assessment of Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue samples is a well-established clinical routine for cancer diagnosis. While providing rich morphological data, it lacks information on protein expression patterns which is crucial for cancer prognosis and treatment recommendations. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) excels in highly multiplexed protein profiling but faces challenges like high operational cost and a restrictive focus on small Regions-of-Interest. Addressing this, we introduce Multi-V-Stain, a novel image-to-image translation method for multiplexed IMC virtual staining. Our method effectively utilizes the rich morphological features from H&amp;E images to predict multiplexed protein expressions at a Whole-Slide Image level. In evaluations using an in-house melanoma dataset, Multi-V-Stain consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and biological relevance of the generated stains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Bethesda system (TBS) for reporting thyroid cytopathology recommends an &#34;atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)&#34; rate of 10%. Recent data suggest that this category might be overused when the rate of cases with molecular positive results is low. As a quality metric, we calculated the AUS and positive call rates for our cytology lab and each cytopathologist.

MethodsA retrospective analysis of all thyroid cytology cases in a 4.5-year period was performed. Cases were stratified by TBS category, and molecular testing results were collected for indeterminate categories. The AUS rate was calculated for each cytopathologist (CP) and the laboratory. The molecular positive call rate (PCR) was calculated with and without the addition of currently negative to the positive results obtained from the ThyroSeq report.

Results7,535 cases were classified as non-diagnostic 7.6%, benign 69%, AUS 17.5%, follicular neoplasm / suspicious for follicular neoplasm 1.4%, suspicious for malignancy 0.7 %, and malignant 3.8%. The AUS rate for each cytopathologist ranged from 9.9-36.8%. The overall PCR for the cytology laboratory was 24% (range 13-35.6% per CP). When including cases with currently negative results, the PCR increased to 35.5% for the cytology laboratory (range 13-42.6% per CP). Comparison analysis indicates a combination of overcalling benign cases and, less frequently, under calling of higher TBS category cases.

ConclusionsThe AUS rate in the context of PCR is a useful metric to assess cytology laboratory and cytopathologists performance. Continuous feedback on this metric could help improve the overall quality of reporting thyroid cytology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Renal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma are two kidney cancer types that present a diagnostic challenge to pathologists and other clinicians due to their microscopic similarities. While RO is a benign renal neoplasm, ChRCC is considered malignant. Therefore, the differentiation between the two is crucial. In this study, we introduce an explainable framework to accurately differentiate ChRCC from RO, histologically. Our approach examined H&amp;E-stained images of 656 ChRCC and 720 RO, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%, the sensitivity of 87%, and 100% specificity for explainable AI, which either outperforms or operate on par with convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

Besides, we enrolled 44 pathology experts (including pathologists and pathology trainees) to differentiate the two tumors. The average accuracy of pathologists was 73%, which is 15.2% lower than our framework.

These results indicate that the combination of human expert along with explainable AI achieve higher accuracy in differentiating the two tumors, while it reduces the workload of experts and offers the desired explainability for the medical experts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions.

ObjectiveTo investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption.

MethodsFemale and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression.

ResultsChronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups.

ConclusionDC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.</p>
