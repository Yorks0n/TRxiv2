Therefore, targeting host:parasite biology that regulates these changes in gene expression could open up routes to pathogen control. Here, we show that in the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii, host signals (termed effectostimulins) within plant roots activate the master regulator sugr1. SUGR1, then, directly binds effector promoters, and orchestrates their production. Effector production, in turn, facilitates host entry, releasing more effectostimulins. These data show that gene expression during the very earliest stages of parasitism is defined by a feed forward loop for host entry. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking SUGR1 blocks parasitism, underlining the SUGR1 signalling cascade as a valuable target for crop protection. Given that nematodes also parasitise humans and other animals, the potential impact is broad: disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.

M.; Ruiz-Cordero, R.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301631\nBackground: The Bethesda system (TBS) for reporting thyroid cytopathology recommends an atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) rate of 10%. Recent data suggest that this category might be overused when the rate of cases with molecular positive results is low. As a quality metric, we calculated the AUS and positive call rates for our cytology lab and each cytopathologist. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all thyroid cytology cases in a 4.5-year period was performed. Cases were stratified by TBS category, and molecular testing results were collected for indeterminate categories. The AUS rate was calculated for each cytopathologist (CP) and the laboratory. The molecular positive call rate (PCR) was calculated with and without the addition of currently negative to the positive results obtained from the ThyroSeq report. Results: 7,535 cases were classified as non-diagnostic 7.6%, benign 69%, AUS 17.5%, follicular neoplasm / suspicious for follicular neoplasm 1.4%, suspicious for malignancy 0.7 %, and malignant 3.8%. The AUS rate for each cytopathologist ranged from 9.9-36.8%. The overall PCR for the cytology laboratory was 24% (range 13-35.6% per CP). When including cases with currently negative results, the PCR increased to 35.5% for the cytology laboratory (range 13-42.6% per CP). Comparison analysis indicates a combination of overcalling benign cases and, less frequently, under calling of higher TBS category cases. Conclusions: The AUS rate in the context of PCR is a useful metric to assess cytology laboratory and cytopathologists' performance. Continuous feedback on this metric could help improve the overall quality of reporting thyroid cytology.\nInnate Immune Activation and Mitochondrial ROS Invoke Persistent Cardiac Conduction System Dysfunction after COVID-19\nAuthors: Ashok, D.; Liu, T.; Criscione, J.; Prakash, M.; Kim, B.; Chow, J.; Craney, M.; Papanicolaou, K.; Sidor, A.; Foster, D. B.; Pekosz, A.; Villano, J.; Kim, D.-H.; O'Rourke, B.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574280\nBackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19. MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2+ handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.\nImpact of Mesotherapy with Sodium Deoxycholate on Liver: Metabolic- and Sex-Specific Insights in Swiss mice\nAuthors: Goncalves, L. F.; Rosa, B. R.; Ramos, I. T. T.; Feder, J. B.; Messina, J. R. M.; Barreira, R. M.; Torres, V. M.; Simoes, V. L.; Paes-de-Almeida, E. C.; Fernandes-Santos, C.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576283\nBackgroundSodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions. ObjectiveTo investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption. MethodsFemale and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression. ResultsChronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups. ConclusionDC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.\nCytoarchitecture of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster lungs by X-ray phase contrast tomography: imaging workflow and classification for drug testing\nAuthors: Reichmann, J.; Sarrazin, C.; Schmale, S.; Blaurock, C.; Balkema-Buschmann, A.; Schmitzer, B.; Salditt, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576083\nX-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. In this work, we present a workflow implemented at a laboratory CT setup, using semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification of lung tissue in an early screen of Covid-19 drug candidates. Different drugs were tested in a hamster model after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To make full use of the recorded high-throughput XPCT data, we then used morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing invaluable insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: The Bethesda system (TBS) for reporting thyroid cytopathology recommends an atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) rate of 10%. Recent data suggest that this category might be overused when the rate of cases with molecular positive results is low. As a quality metric, we calculated the AUS and positive call rates for our cytology lab and each cytopathologist. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all thyroid cytology cases in a 4.5-year period was performed. Cases were stratified by TBS category, and molecular testing results were collected for indeterminate categories. The AUS rate was calculated for each cytopathologist (CP) and the laboratory. The molecular positive call rate (PCR) was calculated with and without the addition of currently negative to the positive results obtained from the ThyroSeq report. Results: 7,535 cases were classified as non-diagnostic 7.6%, benign 69%, AUS 17.5%, follicular neoplasm / suspicious for follicular neoplasm 1.4%, suspicious for malignancy 0.7 %, and malignant 3.8%. The AUS rate for each cytopathologist ranged from 9.9-36.8%. The overall PCR for the cytology laboratory was 24% (range 13-35.6% per CP). When including cases with currently negative results, the PCR increased to 35.5% for the cytology laboratory (range 13-42.6% per CP). Comparison analysis indicates a combination of overcalling benign cases and, less frequently, under calling of higher TBS category cases. Conclusions: The AUS rate in the context of PCR is a useful metric to assess cytology laboratory and cytopathologists&#39; performance. Continuous feedback on this metric could help improve the overall quality of reporting thyroid cytology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiac risk rises during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and in long COVID syndrome in humans, but the mechanisms behind COVID-19-linked arrhythmias are unknown. This study explores the acute and long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiac conduction system (CCS) in a hamster model of COVID-19.

MethodsRadiotelemetry in conscious animals was used to non-invasively record electrocardiograms and subpleural pressures after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage infiltration of the CCS, were assessed at 4 days and 4 weeks post-infection. A double-stranded RNA mimetic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), was used in vivo and in vitro to activate viral pattern recognition receptors in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 induced pronounced tachypnea and severe cardiac conduction system (CCS) dysfunction, spanning from bradycardia to persistent atrioventricular block, although no viral protein expression was detected in the heart. Arrhythmias developed rapidly, partially reversed, and then redeveloped after the pulmonary infection was resolved, indicating persistent CCS injury. Increased cardiac cytokines, interferon-stimulated gene expression, and macrophage remodeling in the CCS accompanied the electrophysiological abnormalities. Interestingly, the arrhythmia phenotype was reproduced by cardiac injection of PIC in the absence of virus, indicating that innate immune activation was sufficient to drive the response. PIC also strongly induced cytokine secretion and robust interferon signaling in hearts, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and engineered heart tissues, accompanied by alterations in electrical and Ca2&#43; handling properties. Importantly, the pulmonary and cardiac effects of COVID-19 were blunted by in vivo inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or by a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

ConclusionsThe findings indicate that long term dysfunction and immune cell remodeling of the CCS is induced by COVID-19, arising indirectly from oxidative stress and excessive activation of cardiac innate immune responses during infection, with implications for long COVID Syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSodium deoxycholate (DC) is often used in mesotherapy for the aesthetic improvement of body contouring. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, DC use is off-label since, to date, it is approved solely for submental fat reduction, lacking evidence to support its safety to other body regions.

ObjectiveTo investigate the systemic and hepatic effects of the prolonged use of DC in mesotherapy for fat reduction in Swiss mice under fructose consumption.

MethodsFemale and male Swiss mice received water or 20% fructose (F) ad libitum for 12 weeks. DC 50 g sc. was administered into the right inguinal white adipose tissue (riWAT) twice weekly for 4 weeks starting week 8. We assessed body weight (BW), glucose, lipolysis, hepatic enzymes, adipose tissue remodeling, liver histopathology, and protein expression.

ResultsChronic DC did not affect BW, glucose, lipolysis, and hepatic enzymes, except for ALT in males. Although the riWAT weight remained stable, we found foam cells, tissue hemorrhage, and fibrosis. DC induced neither hepatomegaly nor hepatocyte hypertrophy in either sex except for fructose in females, which led to heavier livers and increased hepatocyte nuclei volume. Mild fat deposition was present in fructose-fed female mice, with no influence of DC injections. Finally, FXR and FGF21 protein expression were similar among the groups.

ConclusionDC had no impact on BW or adipose tissue mass, although there were features of chronic riWAT inflammation. It failed to impair glucose and hepatic metabolism, morphology, and protein expression in both sexes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. In this work, we present a workflow implemented at a laboratory CT setup, using semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification of lung tissue in an early screen of Covid-19 drug candidates. Different drugs were tested in a hamster model after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To make full use of the recorded high-throughput XPCT data, we then used morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing invaluable insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment.</p>
