While successful alveolar regeneration after injury depends on pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCEC) reprogramming, the steps involving PCEC during lung injury and resolution as well as the influence of aging are unknown. MethodsWe used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to compare the transcriptome of bleomycin-induced fibrotic lungs of young (7 weeks) and aged (18 months) mice, at 3 time points corresponding to the peak of fibrosis (14 days), regeneration (28 days) and resolution (60 days). ResultsAmong the 44541 sequenced and annotated cells, we confirmed the transcriptomic dynamics of several cell types including macrophages, in which conversion is conserved between young and aged mice. We also found that lung injury shifts the transcriptomic profiles of recently described PCEC cell types, with 4 prominent signatures. These signatures are characterized by the overexpression of Lrg1 and are associated with pro-angiogenic signaling, potentially supported by adjacent cell types into the alveolar niche. These signatures were not equally maintained through the resolution process and between young and old animals. Moreover, part of this set of resolution-associated markers was also detected in pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) from IPF samples. Finally, we found that aging also altered the transcriptome of general capillary cells (gCap) which display typical pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory features. ConclusionsWe provide a detailed characterization of the cellular dynamics associated with fibrosis development and resolution in young and aged lungs and propose that age-associated alterations in specific PCEC subpopulations may interfere with the process of lung progenitor differentiation contributing to the persistent fibrotic process typical of human pathology.\nIFNγ modestly contributes to disease progression in the Ndufs4(-/-) model of Leigh syndrome while IP10 is dispensable\nAuthors: Hanaford, A. R.; Khanna, A.; James, K.; Truong, V.; Liao, R. W.; Chen, Y.; Mulholland, M.; Kayser, E.-B.; Hsieh, E. S.; Sedensky, M.; Morgan, P.; Kalia, V.; Sarkar, S.; Johnson, S. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.09.548281\nLeigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric presentation of genetic mitochondrial disease. LS is a multi-system disease characterized by severe neurologic and metabolic abnormalities. The defining feature of the disease is the presence of symmetric, bilateral, progressive necrotizing lesions in the brain stem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression in LS have yet to be elucidated. Recent evidence demonstrates that the immune system plays a key role in LS pathogenesis. Treatment with the macrophage-depleting Csf1r inhibitor pexidartinib prevents disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS, but the mechanisms leading to immune activation and governing disease progression remain to be elucidated. In recent work, the cytokines IFN{gamma} and IFN{gamma}-induced protein 10 (IP10) were found to be significantly elevated in Ndufs4(-/-) brainstem. Given their role as macrophage-activating factors, here we sought to assess the role of IFN{gamma} and IP10 in LS using by generating Ndufs4(-/-)/Ifng(-/-) and Ndufs4(-/-)/IP10(-/-) double knockout lines. We find that IP10 alone does not significantly impact the onset or progression of disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) model, while IFN{gamma} loss significantly, but modestly, improves survival. These data indicate that IFN{gamma} contributes to pathology, but that IFN{gamma} and IP10 are both dispensable for overall disease course of LS. Our findings support some role for IFN{gamma} targeting therapies in the management of mitochondrial disease, but suggest they may provide only modest benefits, at least in LS.\nClinical Significance of the Stromatic Component in Ovarian Cancer: Quantity Over Quality in Outcome Prediction\nAuthors: Lou, E.; Clemente, V.; Grube, M.; Svedbom, A.; Nelson, A. C.; Blome, F.; Staebler, A.; Kommoss, S.; Bazzaro, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546712\nBackgroundThe tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer. MethodsThis study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H\u0026E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors. ResultsWe found that high TSP (\u003e50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644. ConclusionsIn HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.\n",

We find that IP10 alone does not significantly impact the onset or progression of disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) model, while IFN{gamma} loss significantly, but modestly, improves survival. These data indicate that IFN{gamma} contributes to pathology, but that IFN{gamma} and IP10 are both dispensable for overall disease course of LS. Our findings support some role for IFN{gamma} targeting therapies in the management of mitochondrial disease, but suggest they may provide only modest benefits, at least in LS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe tumor stroma is composed of a complex network of non-cancerous cells and extracellular matrix elements that collectively are crucial for cancer progression and treatment response. Within the realm of ovarian cancer, the expression of the stromal gene cluster has been linked to poorer progression-free and overall survival rates. However, in the age of precision medicine and genome sequencing, the notion that the simple measurement of tumor-stroma proportion alone can serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome is a topic that continues to generate controversy and provoke discussion. Our current study reveals that it is the quantity of stroma, rather than its quality, that serves as a clinically significant indicator of patient outcome in ovarian cancer.

MethodsThis study leveraged the High-Grade-Serous-Carcinoma (HGSC) cohort of the publicly accessible Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) along with an independent cohort comprising HGSC clinical specimens in diagnostic and Tissue Microarray formats. Our objective was to investigate the correlation between the Tumor-Stroma-Proportion (TSP) and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response to chemotherapy. We assessed these associations using H&amp;E-stained slides and tissue microarrays. Our analysis employed semi-parametric models that accounted for age, metastases, and residual disease as controlling factors.

ResultsWe found that high TSP (&gt;50% stroma) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.016) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.006). Tumors from patients with chemoresistant tumors were twice as likely to have high TSP as compared to tumors from chemosensitive patients (p=0.012). In tissue microarrays, high TSP was again associated with significantly shorter PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0001), further confirming our findings. The Area Under the ROC curve for the model predicting platinum was estimated at 0.7644.

ConclusionsIn HGSC, TSP was a consistent and reproducible marker of clinical outcome measures, including PFS, OS, and platinum chemoresistance. Assessment of TSP as a predictive biomarker that can be easily implemented and integrated into prospective clinical trial design and adapted to identify, at time of initial diagnosis, patients who are least likely to benefit long-term from conventional platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.</p>
