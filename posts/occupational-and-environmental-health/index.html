Currently, influenza A virus surveillance is based on the clinical diagnosis and reporting of disease cases. In this study, we apply wastewater-based surveillance to monitor the incidence of the influenza A virus at the population level. We report incidence data of the influenza A virus in 10 wastewater treatment plant catchment areas covering 40% of the Finnish population. Altogether, 141 monthly composite influent wastewater samples (collected between April 2020 and May 2021) were analysed from supernatant fraction using influenza A virus specific RT-qPCR method. During the study period, an influenza A virus epidemic occurred in two waves in Finland. This study shows that the influenza A virus can be detected from the supernatant fraction of 24 h composite influent wastewater samples. The influenza A virus gene copy number in wastewater correlated with the number of confirmed disease cases in the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The Kendalls {tau} correlation strength was over 0.600 in all wastewater treatment plants, save for one, which was 0.459. The strongest correlations were 0.761 and 0.833. Wastewater-based surveillance of the influenza A virus is an unbiased method and cost-efficiently reflects the circulation of the virus in the entire population. Thus, wastewater monitoring complements the available, but often too sparse, information from individual testing and improves health care and public health preparedness for influenza A virus pandemics.\nAddressing tuberculosis in artisanal and small-scale mining activities in sub-Saharan Africa: meta-analysis and a call for actions\nAuthors: Mayeri, D. G.; Kambale, R. M.; Bugeme, P. M.; Ngaboyeka, G. A.; Mushagalusa, C.; Zahinda, F. M.; Tamuzi, J. L.; Katoto, P. C.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294543\nBackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a significant health issue in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, and artisanal mining (AM) may be a contributing factor. However, no systematic review has investigated the association between AM and TB in SSA. Therefore, this study aims to assess the burden of TB among artisanal miners in SSA. MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies on AM and TB published up to January 25, 2022. We presented the findings of seven studies that met our inclusion criteria narratively and through figure synthesis, and used inverse-variance weighted random-effects models to combine effect estimates for meta-analysis. ResultsThe overall prevalence of TB among artisanal workers was estimated to be 15% (95%CI: 8, 23), with higher rates in high TB burden countries (19%, 95%CI: 11, 28) compared to upper-moderate burden countries (8%, 95%CI: 3, 19. Further, exposure to silica dust, a common byproduct of AM, significantly increased the incidence of TB, with a pooled relative risk of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.77, 2.71). Additionally, we found that a higher number of artisanal miners in Ghana was associated with a reduction in TB incidence. ConclusionOur findings suggest that exposure to silica dust in AM is a neglected but a significant risk factor for TB in SSA. More studies and efforts are needed to address this threat to TB control.\nInfection Risk Perception, Reporting and Post-Exposure Management of Occupational Injuries Among Healthcare Workers in District Hospitals (Yaounde, Cameroon)\nAuthors: Takougang, I.; Lekeumo Cheuyem, F. Z.; Hangi Ndungo, J.; Enjema Lyonga, E.; Mbopi-Keou, F.-X.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294797\nBackground: The risk of infection among healthcare workers (HCW) is a looming public health problem worldwide. Developing countries are most affected. The present study aimed to identify knowledge gaps, risk perceptions, reporting patterns, and post-exposure management, following needle stick and sharp injuries and contact with other body fluids HCW. Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out from January to April 2022 in six District Hospitals in Yaounde. An auto-administered questionnaire was addressed to consenting HCW. Data were analyzed using R statistic version 4.2.3 and p-value\u003c5% was considered significant. Results: Out of the 217 HCWs that were enrolled, some 10% were unaware of sources of exposure to blood and other body fluids (BBF). Respondents displayed insufficient awareness (74-94%) of the main infectious agents that are likely to be transmitted during an accidental exposure to body fluids (AEB). Some HCWs (6,9%) reported a lack of knowledge of the vaccine against Viral Hepatitis B (VHB). Almost half of participants did not know the appropriate Recommended action for post-exposure case management was known to less than half (42.9%) of participating HCW. Most HCW who had experienced exposure (53.7 %) reported that they did not receive any post-exposure care. Such exposure was often (56.4%) not reported. There was a horizontal variation in underreporting for the same level of healthcare facilities, as it was higher in the Efoulan (OR=3.33) and Nkolndongo (OR=5) District Hospitals. Reasons explaining AEB underreporting were underestimation of vulnerability (51 %) and lack of unawareness of existing post-exposure prophylaxis procedures (42%). Conclusion: While most HCW are aware of the risk of infection associated with exposure to blood and body fluids, reporting was low. Continued educational activities on the risk of infections associated to AEB is warranted. There is a need to implement and scale up structural facilities to enforce measures to prevent exposure, report cases of accidental exposure, ensure post-exposure prophylaxis and counselling.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: The risk of infection among healthcare workers (HCW) is a looming public health problem worldwide. Developing countries are most affected. The present study aimed to identify knowledge gaps, risk perceptions, reporting patterns, and post-exposure management, following needle stick and sharp injuries and contact with other body fluids HCW. Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out from January to April 2022 in six District Hospitals in Yaounde. An auto-administered questionnaire was addressed to consenting HCW. Data were analyzed using R statistic version 4.2.3 and p-value&lt;5% was considered significant. Results: Out of the 217 HCWs that were enrolled, some 10% were unaware of sources of exposure to blood and other body fluids (BBF). Respondents displayed insufficient awareness (74-94%) of the main infectious agents that are likely to be transmitted during an accidental exposure to body fluids (AEB). Some HCWs (6,9%) reported a lack of knowledge of the vaccine against Viral Hepatitis B (VHB). Almost half of participants did not know the appropriate Recommended action for post-exposure case management was known to less than half (42.9%) of participating HCW. Most HCW who had experienced exposure (53.7 %) reported that they did not receive any post-exposure care. Such exposure was often (56.4%) not reported. There was a horizontal variation in underreporting for the same level of healthcare facilities, as it was higher in the Efoulan (OR=3.33) and Nkolndongo (OR=5) District Hospitals. Reasons explaining AEB underreporting were underestimation of vulnerability (51 %) and lack of unawareness of existing post-exposure prophylaxis procedures (42%). Conclusion: While most HCW are aware of the risk of infection associated with exposure to blood and body fluids, reporting was low. Continued educational activities on the risk of infections associated to AEB is warranted. There is a need to implement and scale up structural facilities to enforce measures to prevent exposure, report cases of accidental exposure, ensure post-exposure prophylaxis and counselling.</p>
