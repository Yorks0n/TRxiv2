These hazards pose significant threats to the health of female market traders, who make up the majority of the workforce. However, there has been limited attention given to identifying and addressing the occupational risks faced by these women. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the occupational hazards and the contributing factors to health effects among female market traders in Nakasero market, central Kampala. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among female market traders in Nakasero market, central Kampala. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Data collection involved face-to-face, interviewer-administered, semi-structured questionnaires and key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using EPIDATA 3.02, STATA 14, and Microsoft Excel, while qualitative data were subjected to deductive thematic analysis. Results: The study enrolled 183 female market traders and included input from four key informants. The participants had a mean age of 38 years (standard deviation, SD: 9.37), with the largest age group being 30 to 39 years (36.6%). Most of the respondents were married (43.1%), and the majority had achieved primary education (38.2%) as their highest level of education. Conclusion: This study underscores the ongoing occupational hazards and health effects faced by female market traders in public markets throughout Uganda, arising from a combination of various contributing factors. Addressing these issues is crucial to safeguard the well-being of these women and improve their working conditions.\n",
