Exposure to wood dust leads to multiple respiratory manifestations including cough, chest pain, asthma and altered lung function. The aim of this study was to assess the level of exposure to wood dust and its respiratory health correlates among woodworkers in Yaounde. Methodology: The present descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 37 carpentry workshops in the city of Yaounde. From October 2021 to February 2022. The geographical site selection was purposeful, taking into account areas with large numbers of workers and woodworker shop. Woodworker shops were enumerated and randomly selected. Respiratory manifestations were assessed upon a clinical respiratory examination involving cough, expectoration, wheezing and dyspnea. The forced expiratory volume was determined using a dry spirometer. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23.0 software; tables and graphs were generated using Excel 2013 software. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: The study population was exclusively male, with a mean age of 34.04 plus-minus 11.69 years. With 15.02 plus-minus 12 years of woodwork experience. The respiratory symptoms reported were cough that was productive (41.8%) or dry (33.6%), chest pain (34.4%), dyspnea (41%) and wheezing (15.6%). The lung function decreased among the duration of woodwork experience. Conclusion: Respiratory manifestation among woodworkers were reported. And there is a urgent need to implement woodwork safety measures including education on exposure and adherence to protective measure.\n",
