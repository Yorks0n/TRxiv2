M.; Bugeme, P. M.; Ngaboyeka, G. A.; Mushagalusa, C.; Zahinda, F. M.; Tamuzi, J. L.; Katoto, P. C.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294543\nBackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a significant health issue in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, and artisanal mining (AM) may be a contributing factor. However, no systematic review has investigated the association between AM and TB in SSA. Therefore, this study aims to assess the burden of TB among artisanal miners in SSA. MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies on AM and TB published up to January 25, 2022. We presented the findings of seven studies that met our inclusion criteria narratively and through figure synthesis, and used inverse-variance weighted random-effects models to combine effect estimates for meta-analysis. ResultsThe overall prevalence of TB among artisanal workers was estimated to be 15% (95%CI: 8, 23), with higher rates in high TB burden countries (19%, 95%CI: 11, 28) compared to upper-moderate burden countries (8%, 95%CI: 3, 19. Further, exposure to silica dust, a common byproduct of AM, significantly increased the incidence of TB, with a pooled relative risk of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.77, 2.71). Additionally, we found that a higher number of artisanal miners in Ghana was associated with a reduction in TB incidence. ConclusionOur findings suggest that exposure to silica dust in AM is a neglected but a significant risk factor for TB in SSA. More studies and efforts are needed to address this threat to TB control.\nWastewater-based surveillance is an efficient monitoring tool for tracking influenza A virus in the community\nAuthors: Lehto, K.-M.; Hyder, R.; Länsivaara, A.; Luomala, O.; Lipponen, A.; Hokajärvi, A.-M.; Heikinheimo, A.; Pitkänen, T.; Oikarinen, S.; WastPan Study Group, Score: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294723\nAround the world, influenza A virus has caused severe pandemics, and the risk of future pandemics remains high. Currently, influenza A virus surveillance is based on the clinical diagnosis and reporting of disease cases. In this study, we apply wastewater-based surveillance to monitor the incidence of the influenza A virus at the population level. We report incidence data of the influenza A virus in 10 wastewater treatment plant catchment areas covering 40% of the Finnish population. Altogether, 141 monthly composite influent wastewater samples (collected between April 2020 and May 2021) were analysed from supernatant fraction using influenza A virus specific RT-qPCR method. During the study period, an influenza A virus epidemic occurred in two waves in Finland. This study shows that the influenza A virus can be detected from the supernatant fraction of 24 h composite influent wastewater samples. The influenza A virus gene copy number in wastewater correlated with the number of confirmed disease cases in the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The Kendalls {tau} correlation strength was over 0.600 in all wastewater treatment plants, save for one, which was 0.459. The strongest correlations were 0.761 and 0.833. Wastewater-based surveillance of the influenza A virus is an unbiased method and cost-efficiently reflects the circulation of the virus in the entire population. Thus, wastewater monitoring complements the available, but often too sparse, information from individual testing and improves health care and public health preparedness for influenza A virus pandemics.\nRisk factors for SARS-Cov-2 infection at a United Kingdom electricity-generating company: a test-negative design case-control study\nAuthors: Rutter, C. E.; Van Tongeren, M. J.; Fletcher, T.; Rhodes, S. E.; Chen, Y.; Hall, I.; Warren, N.; Pearce, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294609\nObjectives Identify workplace risk factors for SARS-Cov-2 infection, using data collected by a United Kingdom electricity-generating company. Methods Using a test-negative design case-control study we estimated the odds ratios (OR) of infection by job category, site, test reason, sex, vaccination status, vulnerability, site outage, and site COVID-19 weekly risk rating, adjusting for age, test date and test type. Results From an original 80,077 COVID-19 tests, there were 70,646 included in the final analysis. Most exclusions were due to being visitor tests (5,030) or tests after an individual first tested positive (2,968). Women were less likely to test positive than men (OR=0.71; 95% confidence interval=0.58-0.86). Test reason was strongly associated with positivity and although not a cause of infection itself, due to differing test regimes by area it was a strong confounder for other variables. Compared to routine tests, tests due to symptoms were highest risk (94.99; 78.29-115.24), followed by close contacts (16.73; 13.80-20.29) and looser work contacts 2.66 (1.99-3.56). After adjustment, we found little difference in risk by job category, but some differences by site with three sites showing substantially lower risks, and one site showing higher risks in the final model. Conclusions Infection risk was not associated with job category. Vulnerable individuals were at slightly lower risk, tests during outages were higher risk, vaccination showed no evidence of an effect on testing positive, and site COVID-19 risk rating did not show an ordered trend in positivity rates.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objectives Identify workplace risk factors for SARS-Cov-2 infection, using data collected by a United Kingdom electricity-generating company. Methods Using a test-negative design case-control study we estimated the odds ratios (OR) of infection by job category, site, test reason, sex, vaccination status, vulnerability, site outage, and site COVID-19 weekly risk rating, adjusting for age, test date and test type. Results From an original 80,077 COVID-19 tests, there were 70,646 included in the final analysis. Most exclusions were due to being visitor tests (5,030) or tests after an individual first tested positive (2,968). Women were less likely to test positive than men (OR=0.71; 95% confidence interval=0.58-0.86). Test reason was strongly associated with positivity and although not a cause of infection itself, due to differing test regimes by area it was a strong confounder for other variables. Compared to routine tests, tests due to symptoms were highest risk (94.99; 78.29-115.24), followed by close contacts (16.73; 13.80-20.29) and looser work contacts 2.66 (1.99-3.56). After adjustment, we found little difference in risk by job category, but some differences by site with three sites showing substantially lower risks, and one site showing higher risks in the final model. Conclusions Infection risk was not associated with job category. Vulnerable individuals were at slightly lower risk, tests during outages were higher risk, vaccination showed no evidence of an effect on testing positive, and site COVID-19 risk rating did not show an ordered trend in positivity rates.</p>
