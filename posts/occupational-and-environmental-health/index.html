  "articleBody": " Wastewater-based surveillance is an efficient monitoring tool for tracking influenza A virus in the community\nAuthors: Lehto, K.-M.; Hyder, R.; Länsivaara, A.; Luomala, O.; Lipponen, A.; Hokajärvi, A.-M.; Heikinheimo, A.; Pitkänen, T.; Oikarinen, S.; WastPan Study Group, Score: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294723\nAround the world, influenza A virus has caused severe pandemics, and the risk of future pandemics remains high. Currently, influenza A virus surveillance is based on the clinical diagnosis and reporting of disease cases. In this study, we apply wastewater-based surveillance to monitor the incidence of the influenza A virus at the population level. We report incidence data of the influenza A virus in 10 wastewater treatment plant catchment areas covering 40% of the Finnish population. Altogether, 141 monthly composite influent wastewater samples (collected between April 2020 and May 2021) were analysed from supernatant fraction using influenza A virus specific RT-qPCR method. During the study period, an influenza A virus epidemic occurred in two waves in Finland. This study shows that the influenza A virus can be detected from the supernatant fraction of 24 h composite influent wastewater samples. The influenza A virus gene copy number in wastewater correlated with the number of confirmed disease cases in the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The Kendalls {tau} correlation strength was over 0.600 in all wastewater treatment plants, save for one, which was 0.459. The strongest correlations were 0.761 and 0.833. Wastewater-based surveillance of the influenza A virus is an unbiased method and cost-efficiently reflects the circulation of the virus in the entire population. Thus, wastewater monitoring complements the available, but often too sparse, information from individual testing and improves health care and public health preparedness for influenza A virus pandemics.\nInfection Risk Perception, Reporting and Post-Exposure Management of Occupational Injuries Among Healthcare Workers in District Hospitals (Yaounde, Cameroon)\nAuthors: Takougang, I.; Lekeumo Cheuyem, F. Z.; Hangi Ndungo, J.; Enjema Lyonga, E.; Mbopi-Keou, F.-X.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294797\nBackgroundThe risk of infection among healthcare workers (HCW) is a looming public health problem worldwide. Developing countries are most affected. The present study aimed to identify knowledge gaps, risk perceptions, reporting patterns, and post-exposure management, following needle stick and sharp injuries and contact with other body fluids HCW. MethodsA cross sectional descriptive study was carried out from January to April 2022 in six District Hospitals in Yaounde. An auto-administered questionnaire was addressed to consenting HCW. Data were analyzed using R statistic version 4.2.3 and p-value\u003c5% was considered significant. ResultsOut of the 217 HCWs that were enrolled, some 10% were unaware of sources of exposure to blood and other body fluids (BBF). Respondents displayed insufficient awareness (74-94%) of the main infectious agents that are likely to be transmitted during an accidental exposure to body fluids (AEB). Some HCWs (6,9%) reported a lack of knowledge of the vaccine against Viral Hepatitis B (VHB). Almost half of participants did not know the appropriate Recommended action for post-exposure case management was known to less than half (42.9%) of participating HCW. Most HCW who had experienced exposure (53.7 %) reported that they did not receive any post-exposure care. Such exposure was often (56.4%) not reported. There was a horizontal variation in underreporting for the same level of healthcare facilities, as it was higher in the Efoulan (OR=3.33) and Nkolndongo (OR=5) District Hospitals. Reasons explaining AEB underreporting were underestimation of vulnerability (51 %) and lack of unawareness of existing post-exposure prophylaxis procedures (42%). ConclusionWhile most HCW are aware of the risk of infection associated with exposure to blood and body fluids, reporting was low. Continued educational activities on the risk of infections associated to AEB is warranted. There is a need to implement and scale up structural facilities to enforce measures to prevent exposure, report cases of accidental exposure, ensure post-exposure prophylaxis and counselling.\n",
