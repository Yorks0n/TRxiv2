Camp Pendletons drinking water was not known to be contaminated between 1972 and 1985. Individual-level information on all primary invasive cancers and in-situ bladder cancer diagnosed from 1996 to 2017 was obtained from data linkages with 54 cancer registries in the U.S. Survival methods were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing cancer incidence between the Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton cohorts. Precision of effect estimates were evaluated using the 95% confidence interval (CI) ratio. ResultsCancers among Camp Lejeune Marines/Navy personnel and civilian workers totaled 12,083 (354/100,000) and 1,563 (1,301/100,000), respectively.

Compared to Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune civilian workers had adjusted HRs [\u0026ge;]1.20 with 95% CIRs [\u0026le;]3 for all myeloid cancers including polycythemia vera (HR=1.40, 95% CI: 0.83, 2.36), squamous cell lung cancer (HR=1.63, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.41) and female ductal breast cancer (HR=1.32, 95% CI:1.02, 1.71).
