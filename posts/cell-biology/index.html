The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.\nA Novel Imaging Method (FIM-ID) Reveals that Myofibrillogenesis Plays a Major Role in the Mechanically Induced Growth of Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Jorgenson, K. W.; Hibbert, J. E.; Sayed, R. K.; Lange, A. N.; Godwin, J. S.; Mesquita, P. H.; Ruple, B. A.; McIntosh, M. C.; Kavazis, A. N.; Roberts, M. D.; Hornberger, T. A.\nScore: 37.7, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557204\nAn increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers (i.e., an increase in cross-sectional area). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e., myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e., myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (FIM-ID). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a foundationally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.\nParkinson's genes orchestrate pyroptosis through selective trafficking of mtDNA to leaky lysosomes\nAuthors: Nguyen, M.; Collier, J. J.; Ignatenko, O.; Morin, G.; Huang, S.; Desjardins, M.; McBride, H. M.\nScore: 33.9, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557213\nInflammation is an age-related factor that underlies numerous human disorders. A key driver of inflammation is the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which binds and activates cytosolic sensors. This induces transcriptional responses and, ultimately, pyroptotic cell death. The main challenge has been to understand how mtDNA can cross the two mitochondrial membranes to access the cytosol. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen we identified a new pyroptotic pathway defined by mtDNA exit within mitochondrial-derived vesicles that are delivered to lysosomes. Critically, breach of lysosomes allows mtDNA to access cytosol, requiring multiple Parkinsons Disease-related proteins and Gasdermin pores, identified in the screen. These data place mitochondria-to-lysosome transport as a driver of pyroptosis and link multiple PD proteins along a common pathway. One sentence summaryParkinsons disease-related proteins regulate pyroptosis\nCompetition and Synergy of Arp2/3 and Formins in Nucleating Actin Waves\nAuthors: Chua, X. L.; Tong, C. S.; Xu, X. J.; Su, M.; Xiao, S.; Wu, X.; Wu, M.\nScore: 30.8, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557508\nThe assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their regulatory proteins are crucial for maintaining cell structure or changing physiological state. However, because of the tremendous global impact of actin on diverse cellular processes, dissecting the specific role of actin regulatory proteins remains challenging. In this study, we employ actin waves that propagate on the cortex of mast cell to investigate the interplay between formins and the Arp2/3 complex in the nucleating and turnover of cortical actin. Our findings reveal that the recruitment of FMNL1 and mDia3 precedes the Arp2/3 complex in cortical actin waves. Membrane and GTPase-interaction can drive oscillations of FMNL1 in an actin-dependent manner, but active Cdc42 waves or constitutively-active FMNL1 mutant can form without actin waves. In addition to the apparent coordinated assembly of formins and Arp2/3, we further reveal their antagonism, where inhibition of Arp2/3 complex by CK-666 led to a transient increase in the recruitment of formins and actin polymerization. Our analysis suggest that the antagonism could not be explained for the competition between FMNL1 and Arp2/3 for monomeric actin. Rather, it is regulated by a limited pool of their common upstream regulator, Cdc42, whose level is negatively regulated by Arp2/3. Collectively, our study highlights the multifaceted interactions, cooperative or competitive, between formins and Arp2/3 complex, in the intricate and dynamic control of actin cytoskeletal network.\nPlasma membrane abundance dictates phagocytic capacity and functional crosstalk in myeloid cells\nAuthors: Winer, B. Y.; Settle, A. H.; Yakimov, A. M.; Jeronimo, C.; Lazarovt, T.; Tipping, M.; Saoi, M.; Sawh, A.; Sepp, A.-L. L.; Galiano, M.; Perry, J. S. A.; Wong, Y. Y.; Geissmann, F.; Cross, J.; Zhou, T.; Kam, L. C.; Pasoli, H. A.; Hohl, T.; Cyster, J. G.; Weiner, O.; Huse, M.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.556572\nProfessional phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages tightly control what they eat, how much they eat, and when they move after eating. We show that plasma membrane abundance is a key arbiter of these cellular behaviors. Neutrophils and macrophages lacking the G-protein subunit G{beta}4 exhibit profound plasma membrane expansion due to enhanced production of sphingolipids. This increased membrane allocation dramatically enhances phagocytosis of bacteria, fungus, apoptotic corpses, and cancer cells. G{beta}4 deficient neutrophils are also defective in the normal inhibition of migration following cargo uptake. In G{beta}4 knockout mice, myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phagocytosis of inhaled fungal conidia in the lung but also increased trafficking of engulfed pathogens to other organs. These results reveal an unexpected, biophysical control mechanism lying at the heart of myeloid functional decision-making.\nVisualizing interactions of VDAC1 in live cells using a tetracysteine tag\nAuthors: Pilic, J.; Oflaz, F. E.; Gottschalk, B.; Erdogan, Y. C.; Graier, W. F.; Malli, R.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556841\nThe voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a crucial gatekeeper in the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlling metabolic and energy homeostasis. The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we used the tetracysteine (TC)-tag approach and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The majority of VDAC1-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Additionally, VDAC1 was found at mitochondrial fission sites, likely promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in multiple cellular processes.\nMechanosensitive recruitment of Vinculin maintains junction integrity and barrier function at epithelial tricellular junctions\nAuthors: van den Goor, L. M.; Iseler, J.; Koning, K.; Miller, A. L.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556899\nApical cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), adhere epithelial cells to one another and regulate selective permeability at both bicellular junctions (BCJs) and tricellular junctions (TCJs). Although several specialized proteins are known to localize at TCJs, it remains unclear how actomyosin-mediated tension transmission at TCJs contributes to the maintenance of junction integrity and barrier function at these sites. Here, utilizing gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system, we describe a mechanism by which Vinculin, a mechanosensitive protein, anchors the actomyosin network at TCJs, thus maintaining TJ stability and barrier function. Using an optogenetic approach, we found that acutely increasing junctional tension results in robust recruitment of Vinculin to apical junctions immediately surrounding TCJs. In Vinculin knockdown (KD) embryos, junctional actomyosin intensity is decreased and becomes disorganized at TCJs. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that loss of Vinculin results in reduced Actin stability at TCJs. Vinculin knockdown also destabilizes Angulin-1, a key protein involved in regulating barrier function at TCJs. When Vinculin KD embryos are subjected to increased tension, TCJs cannot maintain their proper morphology. Finally, using a live imaging barrier assay, we detect increased barrier leaks at TCJs in Vinculin KD embryos. Together, our findings show that Vinculin-mediated actomyosin organization is required to maintain junction integrity and barrier function at TCJs and reveal new information about the interplay between adhesion and barrier function at TCJs.

R.; Sakai, Y.; Chino, H.; Knorr, R. L.; Mizushima, N.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557117\nDuring PINK1 and Parkin-mediated mitophagy, autophagy adaptors are recruited to depolarized mitochondria to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Autophagy adaptors such as OPTN and NDP52 bridge mitochondria and autophagosomal membranes by binding to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins and autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN and NDP52 form sheet-like phase-separated condensates with liquid-like properties on the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria. The dynamic and liquid-like feature of OPTN condensates is important for mitophagy activity because reducing the liquidity of OPTN-ubiquitin condensates suppresses the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and impairs mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like model of autophagy adaptors, in contrast to a stoichiometric model, to explain their interactions between autophagic membranes (i.e., ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes) and mitochondrial membranes during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. This model underscores the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in facilitating membrane- membrane contacts, likely through the generation of capillary forces.\nSyntaxin 17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by PI4P accumulation\nAuthors: Shinoda, S.; Sakai, Y.; Matsui, T.; Uematsu, M.; Koyama-Honda, I.; Sakamaki, J.-i.; Yamamoto, H.; Mizushima, N.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557142\nDuring macroautophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by autophagosomes. Lysosomes fuse with closed autophagosomes but not with unclosed intermediate structures. This is achieved in part by the late recruitment of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17) to mature autophagosomes. However, how STX17 recognizes autophagosome maturation is not known. Here, we show that this temporally regulated recruitment of STX17 depends on the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17. Consistent with this finding, mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures. This electrostatic maturation of autophagosomes is likely driven by the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of autophagosomal PI4P prevents the association of STX17 to autophagosomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations support PI4P-dependent membrane insertion of the transmembrane helices of STX17. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by a PI4P-driven change in the surface charge of autophagosomes.\nCaloric restriction promotes beta cell longevity and delays aging and senescence by enhancing cell identity and homeostasis mechanisms.\nAuthors: Santos, C. d.; Shrestha, S.; Cottam, M. A.; Perkins, G.; Lev-Ram, V.; Roy, B.; Acree, C.; Kim, K.-Y.; Deerinck, T.; Cutler, M.; Dean, D.; Cartailler, J. P.; MacDonald, P. E.; Hetzer, M. W.; Ellisman, M. H.; Arrojo e Drigo, R.\nScore: 33.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554369\nCaloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers (i.e., an increase in cross-sectional area). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e., myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e., myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (FIM-ID). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a foundationally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammation is an age-related factor that underlies numerous human disorders. A key driver of inflammation is the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which binds and activates cytosolic sensors. This induces transcriptional responses and, ultimately, pyroptotic cell death. The main challenge has been to understand how mtDNA can cross the two mitochondrial membranes to access the cytosol. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen we identified a new pyroptotic pathway defined by mtDNA exit within mitochondrial-derived vesicles that are delivered to lysosomes. Critically, breach of lysosomes allows mtDNA to access cytosol, requiring multiple Parkinsons Disease-related proteins and Gasdermin pores, identified in the screen. These data place mitochondria-to-lysosome transport as a driver of pyroptosis and link multiple PD proteins along a common pathway.

        <p class="abstract">The assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their regulatory proteins are crucial for maintaining cell structure or changing physiological state. However, because of the tremendous global impact of actin on diverse cellular processes, dissecting the specific role of actin regulatory proteins remains challenging. In this study, we employ actin waves that propagate on the cortex of mast cell to investigate the interplay between formins and the Arp2/3 complex in the nucleating and turnover of cortical actin. Our findings reveal that the recruitment of FMNL1 and mDia3 precedes the Arp2/3 complex in cortical actin waves. Membrane and GTPase-interaction can drive oscillations of FMNL1 in an actin-dependent manner, but active Cdc42 waves or constitutively-active FMNL1 mutant can form without actin waves. In addition to the apparent coordinated assembly of formins and Arp2/3, we further reveal their antagonism, where inhibition of Arp2/3 complex by CK-666 led to a transient increase in the recruitment of formins and actin polymerization. Our analysis suggest that the antagonism could not be explained for the competition between FMNL1 and Arp2/3 for monomeric actin. Rather, it is regulated by a limited pool of their common upstream regulator, Cdc42, whose level is negatively regulated by Arp2/3. Collectively, our study highlights the multifaceted interactions, cooperative or competitive, between formins and Arp2/3 complex, in the intricate and dynamic control of actin cytoskeletal network.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Professional phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages tightly control what they eat, how much they eat, and when they move after eating. We show that plasma membrane abundance is a key arbiter of these cellular behaviors. Neutrophils and macrophages lacking the G-protein subunit G{beta}4 exhibit profound plasma membrane expansion due to enhanced production of sphingolipids. This increased membrane allocation dramatically enhances phagocytosis of bacteria, fungus, apoptotic corpses, and cancer cells. G{beta}4 deficient neutrophils are also defective in the normal inhibition of migration following cargo uptake. In G{beta}4 knockout mice, myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phagocytosis of inhaled fungal conidia in the lung but also increased trafficking of engulfed pathogens to other organs. These results reveal an unexpected, biophysical control mechanism lying at the heart of myeloid functional decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a crucial gatekeeper in the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlling metabolic and energy homeostasis. The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we used the tetracysteine (TC)-tag approach and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The majority of VDAC1-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Additionally, VDAC1 was found at mitochondrial fission sites, likely promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in multiple cellular processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apical cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), adhere epithelial cells to one another and regulate selective permeability at both bicellular junctions (BCJs) and tricellular junctions (TCJs). Although several specialized proteins are known to localize at TCJs, it remains unclear how actomyosin-mediated tension transmission at TCJs contributes to the maintenance of junction integrity and barrier function at these sites. Here, utilizing gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system, we describe a mechanism by which Vinculin, a mechanosensitive protein, anchors the actomyosin network at TCJs, thus maintaining TJ stability and barrier function. Using an optogenetic approach, we found that acutely increasing junctional tension results in robust recruitment of Vinculin to apical junctions immediately surrounding TCJs. In Vinculin knockdown (KD) embryos, junctional actomyosin intensity is decreased and becomes disorganized at TCJs. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that loss of Vinculin results in reduced Actin stability at TCJs. Vinculin knockdown also destabilizes Angulin-1, a key protein involved in regulating barrier function at TCJs. When Vinculin KD embryos are subjected to increased tension, TCJs cannot maintain their proper morphology. Finally, using a live imaging barrier assay, we detect increased barrier leaks at TCJs in Vinculin KD embryos. Together, our findings show that Vinculin-mediated actomyosin organization is required to maintain junction integrity and barrier function at TCJs and reveal new information about the interplay between adhesion and barrier function at TCJs.

        <p class="abstract">During PINK1 and Parkin-mediated mitophagy, autophagy adaptors are recruited to depolarized mitochondria to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Autophagy adaptors such as OPTN and NDP52 bridge mitochondria and autophagosomal membranes by binding to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins and autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN and NDP52 form sheet-like phase-separated condensates with liquid-like properties on the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria. The dynamic and liquid-like feature of OPTN condensates is important for mitophagy activity because reducing the liquidity of OPTN-ubiquitin condensates suppresses the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and impairs mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like model of autophagy adaptors, in contrast to a stoichiometric model, to explain their interactions between autophagic membranes (i.e., ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes) and mitochondrial membranes during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. This model underscores the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in facilitating membrane- membrane contacts, likely through the generation of capillary forces.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During macroautophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by autophagosomes. Lysosomes fuse with closed autophagosomes but not with unclosed intermediate structures. This is achieved in part by the late recruitment of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17) to mature autophagosomes. However, how STX17 recognizes autophagosome maturation is not known. Here, we show that this temporally regulated recruitment of STX17 depends on the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17. Consistent with this finding, mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures. This electrostatic maturation of autophagosomes is likely driven by the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of autophagosomal PI4P prevents the association of STX17 to autophagosomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations support PI4P-dependent membrane insertion of the transmembrane helices of STX17. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by a PI4P-driven change in the surface charge of autophagosomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Caloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.</p>
