F.\nScore: 27.9, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558144\nOrgan size is controlled by numerous factors including mechanical forces, which are mediated in part by the Hippo pathway. In growing Drosophila melanogaster epithelial tissues, cytoskeletal tension influences Hippo signalling by modulating the subcellular localisation of key pathway proteins in different apical domains, namely adherens junctions, the sub-apical region and the medial apical cortex. Here, using both electron and light microscopy, we have discovered the existence of basal spot junctions in D. melanogaster epithelial tissues, and that they respond to morphogenetic forces and also influence Hippo signalling. Like adherens junctions, the Warts kinase is recruited to basal spot junctions via Ajuba and E-cadherin, which prevent Warts activation by segregating it from upstream Hippo pathway proteins. Basal spot junctions are prominent when tissues undergo morphogenesis and are highly sensitive to fluctuations in cytoskeletal tension. Basal spot junctions are distinct from focal adhesions, but the latter profoundly influences the abundance of spot junctions by modulating the basal-medial actomyosin network and tension experienced by spot junctions. Thus, basal spot junctions potentially couple morphogenetic forces to Hippo pathway activity and organ growth.\nNascent Chain Ubiquitination is Uncoupled from Degradation to Enable Protein Maturation\nAuthors: Li, X.; Mariappan, M.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561585\nA significant proportion of nascent proteins undergo polyubiquitination on ribosomes in mammalian cells, yet the fate of these proteins remains elusive. The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a mechanism that mediates the ubiquitination of nascent chains on stalled ribosomes. In this study, we find that nascent proteins ubiquitinated on stalled ribosomes by the RQC ligase LTN1 are insufficient for proteasomal degradation. Our biochemical reconstitution studies reveal that ubiquitinated nascent chains are promptly deubiquitinated in the cytosol upon release from stalled ribosomes, as they are no longer associated with LTN1 E3 ligase for continuous ubiquitination to compete with cytosolic deubiquitinases. These deubiquitinated nascent chains can mature into stable proteins. However, if they misfold and expose a degradation signal, cytosolic quality control recognizes them for re-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, our findings suggest that cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination spare foldable nascent proteins while ensuring the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins.\nBsp1, a fungal CPI motif protein, regulates actin filament capping in endocytosis and cytokinesis\nAuthors: Hummel, D. R.; Hakala, M.; Toret, C. P.; Kaksonen, M.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561521\nThe capping of barbed filament ends is a fundamental mechanism for actin regulation. Capping protein controls filament growth and actin turnover in cells by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments with high affinity and slow off-rate. The interaction between Capping protein and actin is regulated by capping protein interaction (CPI) motif proteins. We identified a novel CPI motif protein, Bsp1, which is involved in cytokinesis and endocytosis in budding yeast. We demonstrate that Bsp1 is an actin binding protein with a high affinity for capping protein via its CPI motif. In cells, Bsp1 regulates capping protein at endocytic sites and is a major recruiter of capping protein to the cytokinetic actin ring. Lastly, we define Bsp1-related proteins as a distinct fungi-specific CPI protein group. Our results suggest that Bsp1 promotes actin filament capping by the capping protein. This study establishes Bsp1 as a new capping protein regulator and promising candidate to regulate actin networks in fungi.\nmTOR inhibits autophagy to facilitate cell swelling and rapid wound repair\nAuthors: Scepanovic, G.; Fernandez-Gonzalez, R.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561758\nEmbryonic wounds repair rapidly, with no inflammation or scarring. Embryonic wound healing is driven by collective cell movements facilitated by the swelling of the cells adjacent to the wound. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is often associated with cell growth. We found that disrupting mTORC1 signalling prevented cell swelling and slowed down wound repair. Catabolic processes, such as autophagy, can inhibit cell growth. Using five-dimensional time-lapse microscopy, as well as pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we demonstrated that the number of autophagosomes decreased during wound repair, suggesting that autophagy must be tightly regulated for rapid wound healing. Quantitative image analysis showed that mTOR inhibition increased autophagy, and that activating autophagy prevented cell swelling and slowed down embryonic wound closure. Finally, reducing autophagy in embryos in which mTORC1 signalling was disrupted rescued rapid wound repair. Together, our results show that mTORC1 activation upon wounding negatively regulates autophagy, allowing cells to increase their volumes to facilitate rapid wound healing.\nCirculating senescent myeloid cells drive blood brain barrier breakdown and neurodegeneration\nAuthors: Wilk, C.

E.; Merad, M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561744\nNeurodegenerative diseases (ND) are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal function. Mechanisms of ND pathogenesis are incompletely understood, hampering the development of effective therapies. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory neoplastic disorder caused by hematopoietic progenitors expressing MAPK activating mutations that differentiate into senescent myeloid cells that drive lesion formation. Some patients with LCH subsequently develop progressive and incurable neurodegeneration (LCH-ND). Here, we show that LCH-ND is caused by myeloid cells that are clonal with peripheral LCH cells. We discovered that circulating BRAFV600E+ myeloid cells cause the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enhancing migration into the brain parenchyma where they differentiate into senescent, inflammatory CD11a+ macrophages that accumulate in the brainstem and cerebellum. Blocking MAPK activity and senescence programs reduced parenchymal infiltration, neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and improved neurological outcome in preclinical LCH-ND. MAPK activation and senescence programs in circulating myeloid cells represent novel and targetable mechanisms of ND.\nCharacterising phagocytes and measuring phagocytosis from live Galleria mellonella larvae\nAuthors: Campbell, J. S.; Bebes, A.; Pradhan, A.; Yuecel, R.; Brown, A. J. P.; Wakefield, J. G.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.558207\nOver the last 20 years, the larva of the greater waxmoth, Galleria mellonella, has rapidly increased in popularity as an in vivo mammalian replacement model organism for the study of human pathogens. Despite this, experimental readouts of response to infection are generally limited to observing the melanisation cascade - where the organism turns black as part of the systemic immune response - and quantifying larval death over time. As an invertebrate, Galleria harbour an innate immune system comprised of both humoral components and a repertoire of innate immune cells - termed hemocytes. Though information on subtypes of hemocytes exist, there are conflicting reports on their exact number and function. Flow cytometry has previously been used to assay Galleria hemocytes, but protocols include both centrifugation and fixation - physical methods which have the potential to affect hemocyte morphology prior to analysis. Here, we present a method for live hemocyte analysis by flow cytometry, revealing that Galleria hemocytes constitute only a single resolvable population, based on relative size or internal complexity. Using fluorescent zymosan particles, we extend our method to show that up to 80% of the Galleria hemocyte population display phagocytic capability. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed assay reliably replicates in vitro data, showing that cell wall {beta}-1,3-glucan masking by Candida albicans subverts phagocytic responses. As such, our method provides a new tool with which to rapidly assess phagocytosis and understand live infection dynamics in Galleria.\nA primordial TFEB-TGFβ signaling axis systemically regulates diapause and stem cell longevity\nAuthors: Nonninger, T. J.; Mak, J.; Gerisch, B.; Ramponi, V.; Kawamura, K.; Schilling, K.; Latza, C.; Koelschbach, J.; Ripa, R.; Serrano, M.; Antebi, A.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561181\nFasting/refeeding enhances animal health and lifespan across taxa. C. elegans can endure months of fasting in adult reproductive diapause (ARD) and upon refeeding, regenerate and reproduce. hlh-30/TFEB is an ARD master regulator whose mutants live mere days in ARD and dont recover with refeeding. Here we find that downregulation of TGF{beta} signaling bypasses hlh-30 collapse, and restores recovery, germline stem cell proliferation and reproductive competence. Upon fasting, HLH-30/TFEB(+) downregulates TGF{beta} in sensory neurons, to inhibit Notch and promote reproductive quiescence in the germline. Upon refeeding, these pathways are upregulated to activate stem cells and promote reproduction. hlh-30 loss induces a senescent-like DNA damage, immune and growth metabolic signature reversed by inhibiting TGF{beta} signaling. TFEBs role is conserved in mammalian diapause models, including mouse embryonic and human cancer diapause. Thus, TFEB-TGF{beta} axis relays systemic signals matching nutrient supply with growth signaling, to regulate stem cell longevity, senescence and regeneration across species.\nAn in vitro platform for quantifying cell cycle phase lengths in primary human intestinal stem cells\nAuthors: Cotton, M. J.; Ariel, P.; Chen, K.; Walcott, V. A.; Dixit, M.; Breau, K. A.; Hinesley, C. M.; Kedziora, K.; Tang, C. Y.; Zheng, A.; Magness, S. T.; Burclaff, J.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561410\nBackground and AimsThe intestinal epithelium exhibits dynamic control of cell cycle phase lengths, yet no experimental platform exists for directly analyzing cell cycle phases in living human intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here, we develop primary human ISC lines with two different reporter constructs to provide fluorescent readouts to analyze cell cycle phases in cycling ISCs. Methods3D printing was used to construct a collagen press for making chamber slides that support primary human ISC growth and maintenance within the working distance of a confocal microscope objective. The PIP-FUCCI fluorescent cell cycle reporter and a variant with H2A-mScarlet that allows for automated tracking of cell cycle phases (PIP-H2A) were used in human ISCs along with live imaging and EdU pulsing. An analysis pipeline combining free-to-use programs and publicly available code was compiled to analyze live imaging results. ResultsChamber slides with soft collagen pressed to a thickness of 0.3 mm concurrently support ISC cycling and confocal imaging. PIP-FUCCI ISCs were found to be optimal for snapshot analysis wherein all nuclei are assigned to a cell cycle phase from a single image. PIP-H2A ISCs were better suited for live imaging since constant nuclear signal allowed for more automated analysis. CellPose2 and TrackMate were used together to track cycling cells. ConclusionsWe present two complete platforms for analyzing cell cycle phases in living primary human ISCs. The PIP-FUCCI construct allows for cell cycle phase assignment from one image of living cells, the PIP-H2A construct allows for semi-automated direct quantification of cell cycle phase lengths in human ISCs using our computational pipeline. These platforms hold great promise for future studies on how pharmaceutical agents affect the intestinal epithelium, how cell cycle is regulated in human ISCs, and more.\nProteomic Analysis Reveals a PLK1-Dependent G2/M Degradation Program and Links PKA-AKAP2 to Cell Cycle Control\nAuthors: Mouery, R. D.; Hsu, C.; Bonacci, T.; Bolhuis, D. L.; Wang, X.; Mills, C. A.; Toomer, E. D.; Canterbury, O. G.; Robertson, K. C.; Branigan, T. B.; Brown, N. G.; Herring, L. E.; Emanuele, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561963\nTargeted protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is an essential mechanism regulating cellular division. The kinase PLK1 coordinates protein degradation at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by promoting the binding of substrates to the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-{beta}TrCP. However, the magnitude to which PLK1 shapes the mitotic proteome has not been characterized. Combining deep, quantitative proteomics with pharmacologic PLK1 inhibition (PLK1i), we identified more than 200 proteins whose abundances were increased by PLK1i at G2/M. We validate many new PLK1-regulated proteins, including several substrates of the cell cycle E3 SCF-Cyclin F, demonstrating that PLK1 promotes proteolysis through at least two distinct SCF-family E3 ligases. Further, we found that the protein kinase A anchoring protein AKAP2 is cell cycle regulated and that its mitotic degradation is dependent on the PLK1/{beta}TrCP-signaling axis. Interactome analysis revealed that the strongest interactors of AKAP2 function in signaling networks regulating proliferation, including MAPK, AKT, and Hippo. Altogether, our data demonstrate that PLK1 coordinates a widespread program of protein breakdown at G2/M. We propose that dynamic proteolytic changes mediated by PLK1 integrate proliferative signals with the core cell cycle machinery during cell division. This has potential implications in malignancies where PLK1 is aberrantly regulated.\nCentriole and transition zone structures in photoreceptor cilia revealed by cryo-electron tomography\nAuthors: Zhang, Z.; Moye, A. R.; He, F.; Chen, M.; Agosto, M. A.; Wensel, T. G.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560879\nPrimary cilia mediate sensory signaling in multiple organisms and cell types but have structures adapted for specific roles. Structural defects in them lead to devastating diseases known as ciliopathies in humans. Key to their functions are structures at their base: the basal body, the transition zone, the \"Y-shaped links\" and the \"ciliary necklace\". We have used cryo-electron tomography with subtomogram averaging and conventional TEM to elucidate the structures associated with the basal region of the \"connecting cilia\" of rod outer segments in mouse retina. The longitudinal variations in microtubule (MT) structures and the lumenal scaffold complexes connecting them have been determined, as well as membrane-associated transition zone structures: Y-shaped links connecting MT to the membrane, and ciliary beads connected to them that protrude from the cell surface and form a necklace-like structure. These results represent a clearer structural scaffold onto which molecules, identified genetics, proteomics, and superresolution fluorescence, can be placed in our emerging model of photoreceptor sensory cilia. SummaryCryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging reveal new structural features at the base of the light sensing cilia of retinal rods. These include the basal body, the Y-links between axoneme and membrane, and the ciliary necklace of the transition zone.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Organ size is controlled by numerous factors including mechanical forces, which are mediated in part by the Hippo pathway. In growing Drosophila melanogaster epithelial tissues, cytoskeletal tension influences Hippo signalling by modulating the subcellular localisation of key pathway proteins in different apical domains, namely adherens junctions, the sub-apical region and the medial apical cortex. Here, using both electron and light microscopy, we have discovered the existence of basal spot junctions in D. melanogaster epithelial tissues, and that they respond to morphogenetic forces and also influence Hippo signalling. Like adherens junctions, the Warts kinase is recruited to basal spot junctions via Ajuba and E-cadherin, which prevent Warts activation by segregating it from upstream Hippo pathway proteins. Basal spot junctions are prominent when tissues undergo morphogenesis and are highly sensitive to fluctuations in cytoskeletal tension. Basal spot junctions are distinct from focal adhesions, but the latter profoundly influences the abundance of spot junctions by modulating the basal-medial actomyosin network and tension experienced by spot junctions. Thus, basal spot junctions potentially couple morphogenetic forces to Hippo pathway activity and organ growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A significant proportion of nascent proteins undergo polyubiquitination on ribosomes in mammalian cells, yet the fate of these proteins remains elusive. The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a mechanism that mediates the ubiquitination of nascent chains on stalled ribosomes. In this study, we find that nascent proteins ubiquitinated on stalled ribosomes by the RQC ligase LTN1 are insufficient for proteasomal degradation. Our biochemical reconstitution studies reveal that ubiquitinated nascent chains are promptly deubiquitinated in the cytosol upon release from stalled ribosomes, as they are no longer associated with LTN1 E3 ligase for continuous ubiquitination to compete with cytosolic deubiquitinases. These deubiquitinated nascent chains can mature into stable proteins. However, if they misfold and expose a degradation signal, cytosolic quality control recognizes them for re-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, our findings suggest that cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination spare foldable nascent proteins while ensuring the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The capping of barbed filament ends is a fundamental mechanism for actin regulation. Capping protein controls filament growth and actin turnover in cells by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments with high affinity and slow off-rate. The interaction between Capping protein and actin is regulated by capping protein interaction (CPI) motif proteins. We identified a novel CPI motif protein, Bsp1, which is involved in cytokinesis and endocytosis in budding yeast. We demonstrate that Bsp1 is an actin binding protein with a high affinity for capping protein via its CPI motif. In cells, Bsp1 regulates capping protein at endocytic sites and is a major recruiter of capping protein to the cytokinetic actin ring. Lastly, we define Bsp1-related proteins as a distinct fungi-specific CPI protein group. Our results suggest that Bsp1 promotes actin filament capping by the capping protein. This study establishes Bsp1 as a new capping protein regulator and promising candidate to regulate actin networks in fungi.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Embryonic wounds repair rapidly, with no inflammation or scarring. Embryonic wound healing is driven by collective cell movements facilitated by the swelling of the cells adjacent to the wound. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is often associated with cell growth. We found that disrupting mTORC1 signalling prevented cell swelling and slowed down wound repair. Catabolic processes, such as autophagy, can inhibit cell growth. Using five-dimensional time-lapse microscopy, as well as pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we demonstrated that the number of autophagosomes decreased during wound repair, suggesting that autophagy must be tightly regulated for rapid wound healing. Quantitative image analysis showed that mTOR inhibition increased autophagy, and that activating autophagy prevented cell swelling and slowed down embryonic wound closure. Finally, reducing autophagy in embryos in which mTORC1 signalling was disrupted rescued rapid wound repair. Together, our results show that mTORC1 activation upon wounding negatively regulates autophagy, allowing cells to increase their volumes to facilitate rapid wound healing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal function. Mechanisms of ND pathogenesis are incompletely understood, hampering the development of effective therapies. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory neoplastic disorder caused by hematopoietic progenitors expressing MAPK activating mutations that differentiate into senescent myeloid cells that drive lesion formation. Some patients with LCH subsequently develop progressive and incurable neurodegeneration (LCH-ND). Here, we show that LCH-ND is caused by myeloid cells that are clonal with peripheral LCH cells. We discovered that circulating BRAFV600E&#43; myeloid cells cause the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enhancing migration into the brain parenchyma where they differentiate into senescent, inflammatory CD11a&#43; macrophages that accumulate in the brainstem and cerebellum. Blocking MAPK activity and senescence programs reduced parenchymal infiltration, neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and improved neurological outcome in preclinical LCH-ND. MAPK activation and senescence programs in circulating myeloid cells represent novel and targetable mechanisms of ND.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the last 20 years, the larva of the greater waxmoth, Galleria mellonella, has rapidly increased in popularity as an in vivo mammalian replacement model organism for the study of human pathogens. Despite this, experimental readouts of response to infection are generally limited to observing the melanisation cascade - where the organism turns black as part of the systemic immune response - and quantifying larval death over time. As an invertebrate, Galleria harbour an innate immune system comprised of both humoral components and a repertoire of innate immune cells - termed hemocytes. Though information on subtypes of hemocytes exist, there are conflicting reports on their exact number and function. Flow cytometry has previously been used to assay Galleria hemocytes, but protocols include both centrifugation and fixation - physical methods which have the potential to affect hemocyte morphology prior to analysis. Here, we present a method for live hemocyte analysis by flow cytometry, revealing that Galleria hemocytes constitute only a single resolvable population, based on relative size or internal complexity. Using fluorescent zymosan particles, we extend our method to show that up to 80% of the Galleria hemocyte population display phagocytic capability. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed assay reliably replicates in vitro data, showing that cell wall {beta}-1,3-glucan masking by Candida albicans subverts phagocytic responses. As such, our method provides a new tool with which to rapidly assess phagocytosis and understand live infection dynamics in Galleria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fasting/refeeding enhances animal health and lifespan across taxa. C. elegans can endure months of fasting in adult reproductive diapause (ARD) and upon refeeding, regenerate and reproduce. hlh-30/TFEB is an ARD master regulator whose mutants live mere days in ARD and dont recover with refeeding. Here we find that downregulation of TGF{beta} signaling bypasses hlh-30 collapse, and restores recovery, germline stem cell proliferation and reproductive competence. Upon fasting, HLH-30/TFEB(&#43;) downregulates TGF{beta} in sensory neurons, to inhibit Notch and promote reproductive quiescence in the germline. Upon refeeding, these pathways are upregulated to activate stem cells and promote reproduction. hlh-30 loss induces a senescent-like DNA damage, immune and growth metabolic signature reversed by inhibiting TGF{beta} signaling. TFEBs role is conserved in mammalian diapause models, including mouse embryonic and human cancer diapause. Thus, TFEB-TGF{beta} axis relays systemic signals matching nutrient supply with growth signaling, to regulate stem cell longevity, senescence and regeneration across species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsThe intestinal epithelium exhibits dynamic control of cell cycle phase lengths, yet no experimental platform exists for directly analyzing cell cycle phases in living human intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here, we develop primary human ISC lines with two different reporter constructs to provide fluorescent readouts to analyze cell cycle phases in cycling ISCs.

Methods3D printing was used to construct a collagen press for making chamber slides that support primary human ISC growth and maintenance within the working distance of a confocal microscope objective. The PIP-FUCCI fluorescent cell cycle reporter and a variant with H2A-mScarlet that allows for automated tracking of cell cycle phases (PIP-H2A) were used in human ISCs along with live imaging and EdU pulsing. An analysis pipeline combining free-to-use programs and publicly available code was compiled to analyze live imaging results.

ResultsChamber slides with soft collagen pressed to a thickness of 0.3 mm concurrently support ISC cycling and confocal imaging. PIP-FUCCI ISCs were found to be optimal for snapshot analysis wherein all nuclei are assigned to a cell cycle phase from a single image. PIP-H2A ISCs were better suited for live imaging since constant nuclear signal allowed for more automated analysis. CellPose2 and TrackMate were used together to track cycling cells.

ConclusionsWe present two complete platforms for analyzing cell cycle phases in living primary human ISCs. The PIP-FUCCI construct allows for cell cycle phase assignment from one image of living cells, the PIP-H2A construct allows for semi-automated direct quantification of cell cycle phase lengths in human ISCs using our computational pipeline. These platforms hold great promise for future studies on how pharmaceutical agents affect the intestinal epithelium, how cell cycle is regulated in human ISCs, and more.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is an essential mechanism regulating cellular division. The kinase PLK1 coordinates protein degradation at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by promoting the binding of substrates to the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-{beta}TrCP. However, the magnitude to which PLK1 shapes the mitotic proteome has not been characterized. Combining deep, quantitative proteomics with pharmacologic PLK1 inhibition (PLK1i), we identified more than 200 proteins whose abundances were increased by PLK1i at G2/M. We validate many new PLK1-regulated proteins, including several substrates of the cell cycle E3 SCF-Cyclin F, demonstrating that PLK1 promotes proteolysis through at least two distinct SCF-family E3 ligases. Further, we found that the protein kinase A anchoring protein AKAP2 is cell cycle regulated and that its mitotic degradation is dependent on the PLK1/{beta}TrCP-signaling axis. Interactome analysis revealed that the strongest interactors of AKAP2 function in signaling networks regulating proliferation, including MAPK, AKT, and Hippo. Altogether, our data demonstrate that PLK1 coordinates a widespread program of protein breakdown at G2/M. We propose that dynamic proteolytic changes mediated by PLK1 integrate proliferative signals with the core cell cycle machinery during cell division. This has potential implications in malignancies where PLK1 is aberrantly regulated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primary cilia mediate sensory signaling in multiple organisms and cell types but have structures adapted for specific roles. Structural defects in them lead to devastating diseases known as ciliopathies in humans. Key to their functions are structures at their base: the basal body, the transition zone, the &#34;Y-shaped links&#34; and the &#34;ciliary necklace&#34;. We have used cryo-electron tomography with subtomogram averaging and conventional TEM to elucidate the structures associated with the basal region of the &#34;connecting cilia&#34; of rod outer segments in mouse retina. The longitudinal variations in microtubule (MT) structures and the lumenal scaffold complexes connecting them have been determined, as well as membrane-associated transition zone structures: Y-shaped links connecting MT to the membrane, and ciliary beads connected to them that protrude from the cell surface and form a necklace-like structure. These results represent a clearer structural scaffold onto which molecules, identified genetics, proteomics, and superresolution fluorescence, can be placed in our emerging model of photoreceptor sensory cilia.

SummaryCryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging reveal new structural features at the base of the light sensing cilia of retinal rods. These include the basal body, the Y-links between axoneme and membrane, and the ciliary necklace of the transition zone.</p>
