T.; Lepper, C.; Millay, D.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554609\nMultinucleated skeletal muscle cells have an obligatory need to acquire additional nuclei through fusion with activated skeletal muscle stem cells when responding to both developmental and adaptive growth stimuli. A fundamental question in skeletal muscle biology has been the reason underlying this need for new nuclei in syncytial cells that already harbor hundreds of nuclei. To begin to answer this long-standing question, we utilized nuclear RNA-sequencing approaches and developed a lineage tracing strategy capable of defining the transcriptional state of recently fused nuclei and distinguishing this state from that of pre-existing nuclei. Our findings reveal the presence of conserved markers of newly fused nuclei both during development and after a hypertrophic stimulus in the adult. However, newly fused nuclei also exhibit divergent gene expression that is determined by the myogenic environment to which they fuse. Moreover, accrual of new nuclei through fusion is required for nuclei already resident in adult myofibers to mount a normal transcriptional response to a load-inducing stimulus. We propose a model of mutual regulation in the control of skeletal muscle development and adaptations, where newly fused and pre-existing myonuclear populations influence each other to maintain optimal functional growth.\nCaloric restriction promotes beta cell longevity and delays aging and senescence by enhancing cell identity and homeostasis mechanisms.\nAuthors: Santos, C. d.; Shrestha, S.; Cottam, M. A.; Perkins, G.; Lev-Ram, V.; Roy, B.; Acree, C.; Kim, K.-Y.; Deerinck, T.; Cutler, M.; Dean, D.; Cartailler, J. P.; MacDonald, P. E.; Hetzer, M. W.; Ellisman, M. H.; Arrojo e Drigo, R.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554369\nCaloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.\nRAD52 and ERCC6L/PICH have a compensatory relationship for genome stability in mitosis.\nAuthors: Osia, B. A.; Merkell, A.; Lopezcolorado, F. W.; Ping, X.; STARK, J. M.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554522\nThe mammalian RAD52 protein is a DNA repair factor that has both strand annealing and recombination mediator activities, yet is dispensable for cell viability. To characterize genetic contexts that reveal dependence on RAD52 to sustain cell viability (i.e., synthetic lethal relationships), we performed genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens. Subsequent secondary screening found that depletion of ERCC6L in RAD52-deficient cells causes reduced viability and elevated genome instability, measured as accumulation of 53BP1 into nuclear foci. Furthermore, loss of RAD52 causes elevated levels of anaphase ultrafine bridges marked by ERCC6L, and conversely depletion of ERCC6L causes elevated RAD52 foci both in prometaphase and interphase cells. These effects were enhanced with combination treatments using hydroxyurea and the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193, and the timing of these treatments are consistent with defects in addressing such stress in mitosis. Thus, loss of RAD52 appears to cause an increased reliance on ERCC6L in mitosis, and vice versa. Consistent with this notion, combined depletion of ERCC6L and disrupting G2/M progression via CDK1 inhibition causes a marked loss of viability in RAD52-deficient cells. We suggest that RAD52 and ERCC6L play compensatory roles in protecting genome stability in mitosis.\nGlycolytic Metabolon Assembly on Mitochondria via Hexokinase O-GlcNAcylation Promotes Metabolic Efficiency\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Vant, J.; Wu, Y.; Sanchez, R.; Micou, M. L.; Zhang, A.; Luczak, V.; Yu, S. B.; Jabbo, M.; Yoon, S.; Abushawish, A. A.; Ghassemian, M.; Griffis, E.; Hammarlund, M.; Singharoy, A.; Pekkurnaz, G.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554955\nGlucose is the primary cellular energy substrate and its metabolism via glycolysis is initiated by the rate-limiting enzyme Hexokinase (HK). In energy-demanding tissues like the brain, HK1 is the prominent isoform, primarily localized on mitochondria, crucial for the efficient coupling of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby ensuring optimal energy generation. Here, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism whereby metabolic sensor enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modulates HK1 activity and its mitochondrial association. OGT catalyzes reversible O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification, influenced by glucose flux-mediated intracellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of HK1's regulatory domain occurs with increased OGT activity, promoting glycolytic metabolon assembly on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This modification enhances HK1's mitochondrial localization, orchestrating glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production. Mutations in HK1's O-GlcNAcylation site reduce ATP generation, affecting presynaptic vesicle release in neurons. Our findings reveal a new pathway linking neuronal metabolism to mitochondrial function through OGT and glycolytic metabolon formation, and provide important insight into the previously unknown metabolism plasticity mechanism.\nTriaging of -helical proteins to the mitochondrial outer membrane by distinct chaperone machinery based on substrate topology\nAuthors: Muthukumar, G.; Stevens, T. A.; Inglis, A. J.; Esantsi, T. K.; Saunders, R. A.; Schulte, F.; Voorhees, R. M.; Guna, A.; Weissman, J. S.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553624\nMitochondrial outer membrane -helical proteins play critical roles in mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, but the rules governing the targeting and insertion of these biophysically diverse substrates remain unknown. Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse -helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways which act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for efficient targeting of polytopic proteins whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a novel cytosolic chaperone which physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.\nRNA-mediated ribonucleoprotein assembly controls TDP-43 nuclear retention\nAuthors: dos Passos, P. M.; Hemamali, E. H.; Mamede, L. D.; Hayes, L. R.; Ayala, Y. M.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552215\nTDP-43 is an essential RNA-binding protein strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates and loss of nuclear TDP-43. The protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, yet maintaining predominantly nuclear TDP-43 localization is important for TDP-43 function and for inhibiting cytoplasmic aggregation. We previously demonstrated that specific RNA binding mediates TDP-43 self-assembly and biomolecular condensation, requiring multivalent interactions via N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we show that these complexes play a key role in TDP-43 nuclear retention. TDP-43 forms macromolecular complexes with a wide range of size distribution in cells and we find that defects in RNA binding or inter-domain interactions, including phase separation, impair the assembly of the largest species. Our findings suggest that recruitment into these macromolecular complexes prevents cytoplasmic egress of TDP-43 in a size-dependent manner. Our observations uncover fundamental mechanisms controlling TDP-43 cellular homeostasis, whereby regulation of RNA-mediated self-assembly modulates TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic distribution. Moreover, these findings highlight pathways that may be implicated in TDP-43 proteinopathies and identify potential therapeutic targets.\nSpatiotemporal control of microtubule acetylation by mechanical cues regulates lysosome dynamics at the immune synapse of B cells to promote antigen presentation\nAuthors: Del Valle Batalla, F.; Riobo Cavada, I.; Hernandez-Perez, S.; Mattila, P. K.; Yuseff, M.-I.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555091\nThe capacity of B cells to extract immobilized antigens through the formation of an immune synapse can be tuned by the physical characteristics of the surface where antigens are encountered. However, the underlying mechanisms that couple mechanosensing by B cells to antigen extraction and processing remain poorly understood. We show that B cells interacting with antigens associated with stiffer substrates exhibit enhanced spreading responses and higher tubulin acetylation at the center of the immune synapse, where less motile lysosomes preferentially localize. This process is coupled to the translocation of the microtubule acetylase, ATAT1 to the cytoplasm of B cells, which occurs as a mechano-response during BCR stimulation. Accordingly, B cells silenced for ATAT1 are unable to stabilize lysosomes at the synaptic interface and display a lower capacity to extract and present immobilized antigens to T cells. Overall, these findings highlight how BCR-dependent mechano-responses trigger microtubule network modifications to precisely orchestrate lysosome positioning to promote antigen extraction and presentation in B cells.\nUbiquitin-driven protein condensation promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis\nAuthors: Yuan, F.; Gollapudi, S.; Day, K.; Ashby, G.; Sangani, A.; Malady, B.; Wang, L.; Lafer, E. M.; Huibregtse, J.; Stachowiak, J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554139\nClathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular pathway that enables signaling and recycling of transmembrane proteins and lipids. During endocytosis, dozens of cytosolic proteins come together at the plasma membrane, assembling into a highly interconnected network that drives endocytic vesicle biogenesis. Recently, multiple labs have reported that early endocytic proteins form liquid-like condensates, which provide a flexible platform for the efficient assembly of endocytic vesicles. Given the importance of this network in the dynamics of endocytosis, how might cells regulate its stability? Many receptors and endocytic proteins are ubiquitylated, while early endocytic proteins such as Eps15 contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Therefore, we examined the influence of ubiquitin on the stability of the early endocytic protein network. In vitro, we found that recruitment of small amounts of polyubiquitin dramatically increased the stability of Eps15 condensates, suggesting that ubiquitylation could nucleate endocytic sites. In live cell imaging experiments, a version of Eps15 that lacked the ubiquitin-interacting motif failed to rescue defects in endocytic initiation created by Eps15 knockout. Furthermore, fusion of Eps15 to a deubiquitinase enzyme destabilized nascent endocytic sites within minutes. These results suggest that ubiquitylation drives assembly of the flexible protein network responsible for catalyzing endocytic events. More broadly, this work illustrates a biophysical mechanism by which ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane could regulate the efficiency of endocytic recycling.\nMitochondrial protein FKBP8 captures PDZD8 to form mitochondria-ER contacts\nAuthors: Nakamura, K.; Aoyama-Ishiwatari, S.; Nagao, T.; Paaran, M.; Obara, C. J.; Sakurai-Saito, Y.; Johnston, J.; Du, Y.; Suga, S.; Tsuboi, M.; Nakakido, M.; Tsumoto, K.; Kishi, Y.; Gotoh, Y.; Kwak, C.; Rhee, H.-W.; Seo, J. K.; Kosako, H.; Potter, C.; Carragher, B.; Lippincott-Schwartz, J.; Polleux, F.; Hirabayashi, Y.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554218\nMitochondria-ER membrane contact sites (MERCS) represent a fundamental ultrastructural feature underlying unique biochemistry and physiology in all cells. The ER protein PDZD8 is required for the formation of MERCS in many cell types. PDZD8 tethering partner on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is unknown, limiting our understanding of MERCS formation and function. Here, by combining unbiased proximity proteomics, CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous protein tagging, Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) tomography, and correlative light-EM (CLEM), we identified the OMM protein FKBP8 as the tethering partner of PDZD8 at MERCS. Single molecule tracking of PDZD8 revealed highly dynamic diffusion properties along the ER contrasting with capture at contacts between ER and mitochondria. Overexpression of FKBP8 was sufficient to recruit PDZD8 along the OMM and narrow the ER-OMM distance, whereas independent versus combined deletions of these two proteins demonstrated their interdependence for MERCS formation. Our results identify a novel molecular complex tethering ER- mitochondria membranes in mammalian cells.\nPhosphorylation-controlled cohesion of a nuclear condensate regulates mRNA retention\nAuthors: McIntyre, A. B. R.; Tschan, A.; Meyer, K.; Walser, S.; Rai, A. K.; Fujita, K.; Pelkmans, L.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554101\nNuclear speckles are membraneless organelles that associate with active transcription sites and participate in post-transcriptional mRNA processing. During the cell cycle, nuclear speckles dissolve following phosphorylation of their protein components. Here, we identify the PP1 family as the phosphatases that counteract kinase-mediated dissolution. PP1 overexpression increases speckle cohesion and leads to retention of polyadenylated RNA within speckles and the nucleus. Using APEX2 proximity labeling combined with RNA-sequencing, we characterized the relationship between the cohesion of nuclear speckles and the recruitment of specific RNAs. We find that many transcripts are preferentially enriched within nuclear speckles compared to the nucleoplasm, particularly chromatin- and nucleus-associated transcripts. While total polyadenylated RNA retention increased with nuclear speckle cohesion, the ratios of most mRNA species to each other were constant, indicating non-selective, or proportional, retention. We then explored whether nuclear speckle cohesion changes in response to environmental perturbations associated with changes in kinase or phosphatase activity. We found that cellular responses to heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxia include changes to the cohesion of nuclear speckles and mRNA retention. Our results demonstrate that tuning the material properties of nuclear speckles provides a mechanism for the acute control of mRNA localization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multinucleated skeletal muscle cells have an obligatory need to acquire additional nuclei through fusion with activated skeletal muscle stem cells when responding to both developmental and adaptive growth stimuli. A fundamental question in skeletal muscle biology has been the reason underlying this need for new nuclei in syncytial cells that already harbor hundreds of nuclei. To begin to answer this long-standing question, we utilized nuclear RNA-sequencing approaches and developed a lineage tracing strategy capable of defining the transcriptional state of recently fused nuclei and distinguishing this state from that of pre-existing nuclei. Our findings reveal the presence of conserved markers of newly fused nuclei both during development and after a hypertrophic stimulus in the adult. However, newly fused nuclei also exhibit divergent gene expression that is determined by the myogenic environment to which they fuse. Moreover, accrual of new nuclei through fusion is required for nuclei already resident in adult myofibers to mount a normal transcriptional response to a load-inducing stimulus. We propose a model of mutual regulation in the control of skeletal muscle development and adaptations, where newly fused and pre-existing myonuclear populations influence each other to maintain optimal functional growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Caloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian RAD52 protein is a DNA repair factor that has both strand annealing and recombination mediator activities, yet is dispensable for cell viability. To characterize genetic contexts that reveal dependence on RAD52 to sustain cell viability (i.e., synthetic lethal relationships), we performed genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens. Subsequent secondary screening found that depletion of ERCC6L in RAD52-deficient cells causes reduced viability and elevated genome instability, measured as accumulation of 53BP1 into nuclear foci. Furthermore, loss of RAD52 causes elevated levels of anaphase ultrafine bridges marked by ERCC6L, and conversely depletion of ERCC6L causes elevated RAD52 foci both in prometaphase and interphase cells. These effects were enhanced with combination treatments using hydroxyurea and the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193, and the timing of these treatments are consistent with defects in addressing such stress in mitosis. Thus, loss of RAD52 appears to cause an increased reliance on ERCC6L in mitosis, and vice versa. Consistent with this notion, combined depletion of ERCC6L and disrupting G2/M progression via CDK1 inhibition causes a marked loss of viability in RAD52-deficient cells. We suggest that RAD52 and ERCC6L play compensatory roles in protecting genome stability in mitosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucose is the primary cellular energy substrate and its metabolism via glycolysis is initiated by the rate-limiting enzyme Hexokinase (HK). In energy-demanding tissues like the brain, HK1 is the prominent isoform, primarily localized on mitochondria, crucial for the efficient coupling of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby ensuring optimal energy generation. Here, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism whereby metabolic sensor enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modulates HK1 activity and its mitochondrial association. OGT catalyzes reversible O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification, influenced by glucose flux-mediated intracellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of HK1&#39;s regulatory domain occurs with increased OGT activity, promoting glycolytic metabolon assembly on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This modification enhances HK1&#39;s mitochondrial localization, orchestrating glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production. Mutations in HK1&#39;s O-GlcNAcylation site reduce ATP generation, affecting presynaptic vesicle release in neurons. Our findings reveal a new pathway linking neuronal metabolism to mitochondrial function through OGT and glycolytic metabolon formation, and provide important insight into the previously unknown metabolism plasticity mechanism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial outer membrane -helical proteins play critical roles in mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, but the rules governing the targeting and insertion of these biophysically diverse substrates remain unknown. Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse -helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways which act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for efficient targeting of polytopic proteins whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a novel cytosolic chaperone which physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">TDP-43 is an essential RNA-binding protein strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates and loss of nuclear TDP-43. The protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, yet maintaining predominantly nuclear TDP-43 localization is important for TDP-43 function and for inhibiting cytoplasmic aggregation. We previously demonstrated that specific RNA binding mediates TDP-43 self-assembly and biomolecular condensation, requiring multivalent interactions via N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we show that these complexes play a key role in TDP-43 nuclear retention. TDP-43 forms macromolecular complexes with a wide range of size distribution in cells and we find that defects in RNA binding or inter-domain interactions, including phase separation, impair the assembly of the largest species. Our findings suggest that recruitment into these macromolecular complexes prevents cytoplasmic egress of TDP-43 in a size-dependent manner. Our observations uncover fundamental mechanisms controlling TDP-43 cellular homeostasis, whereby regulation of RNA-mediated self-assembly modulates TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic distribution. Moreover, these findings highlight pathways that may be implicated in TDP-43 proteinopathies and identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The capacity of B cells to extract immobilized antigens through the formation of an immune synapse can be tuned by the physical characteristics of the surface where antigens are encountered. However, the underlying mechanisms that couple mechanosensing by B cells to antigen extraction and processing remain poorly understood. We show that B cells interacting with antigens associated with stiffer substrates exhibit enhanced spreading responses and higher tubulin acetylation at the center of the immune synapse, where less motile lysosomes preferentially localize. This process is coupled to the translocation of the microtubule acetylase, ATAT1 to the cytoplasm of B cells, which occurs as a mechano-response during BCR stimulation. Accordingly, B cells silenced for ATAT1 are unable to stabilize lysosomes at the synaptic interface and display a lower capacity to extract and present immobilized antigens to T cells. Overall, these findings highlight how BCR-dependent mechano-responses trigger microtubule network modifications to precisely orchestrate lysosome positioning to promote antigen extraction and presentation in B cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular pathway that enables signaling and recycling of transmembrane proteins and lipids. During endocytosis, dozens of cytosolic proteins come together at the plasma membrane, assembling into a highly interconnected network that drives endocytic vesicle biogenesis. Recently, multiple labs have reported that early endocytic proteins form liquid-like condensates, which provide a flexible platform for the efficient assembly of endocytic vesicles. Given the importance of this network in the dynamics of endocytosis, how might cells regulate its stability? Many receptors and endocytic proteins are ubiquitylated, while early endocytic proteins such as Eps15 contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Therefore, we examined the influence of ubiquitin on the stability of the early endocytic protein network. In vitro, we found that recruitment of small amounts of polyubiquitin dramatically increased the stability of Eps15 condensates, suggesting that ubiquitylation could nucleate endocytic sites. In live cell imaging experiments, a version of Eps15 that lacked the ubiquitin-interacting motif failed to rescue defects in endocytic initiation created by Eps15 knockout. Furthermore, fusion of Eps15 to a deubiquitinase enzyme destabilized nascent endocytic sites within minutes. These results suggest that ubiquitylation drives assembly of the flexible protein network responsible for catalyzing endocytic events. More broadly, this work illustrates a biophysical mechanism by which ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane could regulate the efficiency of endocytic recycling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria-ER membrane contact sites (MERCS) represent a fundamental ultrastructural feature underlying unique biochemistry and physiology in all cells. The ER protein PDZD8 is required for the formation of MERCS in many cell types. PDZD8 tethering partner on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is unknown, limiting our understanding of MERCS formation and function. Here, by combining unbiased proximity proteomics, CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous protein tagging, Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) tomography, and correlative light-EM (CLEM), we identified the OMM protein FKBP8 as the tethering partner of PDZD8 at MERCS. Single molecule tracking of PDZD8 revealed highly dynamic diffusion properties along the ER contrasting with capture at contacts between ER and mitochondria. Overexpression of FKBP8 was sufficient to recruit PDZD8 along the OMM and narrow the ER-OMM distance, whereas independent versus combined deletions of these two proteins demonstrated their interdependence for MERCS formation. Our results identify a novel molecular complex tethering ER- mitochondria membranes in mammalian cells.</p>

PP1 overexpression increases speckle cohesion and leads to retention of polyadenylated RNA within speckles and the nucleus. Using APEX2 proximity labeling combined with RNA-sequencing, we characterized the relationship between the cohesion of nuclear speckles and the recruitment of specific RNAs. We find that many transcripts are preferentially enriched within nuclear speckles compared to the nucleoplasm, particularly chromatin- and nucleus-associated transcripts. While total polyadenylated RNA retention increased with nuclear speckle cohesion, the ratios of most mRNA species to each other were constant, indicating non-selective, or proportional, retention. We then explored whether nuclear speckle cohesion changes in response to environmental perturbations associated with changes in kinase or phosphatase activity. We found that cellular responses to heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxia include changes to the cohesion of nuclear speckles and mRNA retention. Our results demonstrate that tuning the material properties of nuclear speckles provides a mechanism for the acute control of mRNA localization.</p>
