M.; Galloway, K. E.\nScore: 51.3, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568736\nThe sparse and stochastic nature of reprogramming has obscured our understanding of how transcription factors drive cells to new identities. To overcome this limit, we developed a compact, portable reprogramming system that increases direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons by two orders of magnitude. We show that subpopulations with different reprogramming potentials are distinguishable by proliferation history. By controlling for proliferation history and titrating each transcription factor, we find that conversion correlates with levels of the pioneer transcription factor Ngn2, whereas conversion shows a biphasic response to Lhx3. Increasing the proliferation rate of adult human fibroblasts generates morphologically mature, induced motor neurons at high rates. Using compact, optimized, polycistronic cassettes, we generate motor neurons that graft with the murine central nervous system, demonstrating the potential for in vivo therapies. One Sentence SummaryUsing a systems and synthetic biology approach to study the molecular determinants of reprogramming, we find that proliferation history and transcription factor levels drive cell fate in direct conversion to motor neurons.

Both processes are regulated by the surfactant-like protein Ki-67, but how Ki-67 achieves these diametric functions has remained unknown. Here, we report that Ki-67 radically switches from a chromosome repellent to a chromosome attractant during anaphase. We show that Ki-67 dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and the simultaneous exposure of a conserved basic patch induce the RNA-dependent formation of a liquid-like condensed phase on the chromosome surface. Experiments and coarse-grained simulations support a model in which the coalescence of chromosome surfaces driven by phase separation promote clustering of chromosomes. Our study reveals how the switch of Ki-67 from a surfactant to a liquid-like condensed phase can generate the mechanical forces during genome segregation that are required for re-establishing nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization after mitosis.\nDynamic label-free analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals virus-induced subcellular remodeling.\nAuthors: Saunders, N.; Monel, B.; Cayet, N.; Archetti, L.; Moreno, H.; Jeanne, A.; Marguier, A.; Wai, T.; Schwartz, O.; Frechin, M.\nScore: 117.0, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567378\nAssessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.\nBiomolecular condensates in fungi are tuned to function at specific temperatures\nAuthors: Stormo, B. M.; McLaughlin, G.; Frederick, L.; Jalihal, A.; Cole, S.; Seim, I.; Dietrich, F.; Gladfelter, A. S.\nScore: 36.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568884\nTemperature can impact every reaction and molecular interaction essential to a cell. For organisms that cannot regulate their own temperature, a major challenge is how to adapt to temperatures that fluctuate unpredictability and on variable timescales. Biomolecular condensation offers a possible mechanism for encoding temperature-responsiveness and robustness into cell biochemistry and organization. To explore this idea, we examined temperature adaptation in a filamentous-growing fungus called Ashbya gossypii that engages biomolecular condensates containing the RNA-binding protein Whi3 to regulate mitosis and morphogenesis. We collected wild isolates of Ashbya that originate in different climates and found that mitotic asynchrony and polarized growth, which are known to be controlled by the condensation of Whi3, are temperature sensitive. Sequence analysis in the wild strains revealed changes to specific domains within Whi3 known to be important in condensate formation. Using an in vitro condensate reconstitution assay we found that temperature impacts the relative abundance of protein to RNA within condensates and that this directly impacts the material properties of the droplets. Finally, we found that exchanging Whi3 genes between warm and cold isolates was sufficient to rescue some, but not all, condensate-related phenotypes. Together these data demonstrate that material properties of Whi3 condensates are temperature sensitive, that these properties are important for function, and that sequence optimizes properties for a given climate.\nCryoET reveals actin filaments within platelet microtubules\nAuthors: Tsuji, C.; Bradshaw, M.; Allen, M.; Jackson, M. L.; Mantell, J.; Borucu, U.; Poole, A. W.; Verkade, P.; Hers, I.; Paul, D. M.; Dodding, M.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568450\nCrosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for many cellular processes. Recent studies have shown that microtubules and F-actin can assemble to form a composite structure where F-actin occupies the microtubule lumen. Whether these cytoskeletal hybrids exist in physiological settings and how they are formed is unclear. Here, we show that the short-crossover Class I actin filament previously identified inside microtubules in human HAP1 cells is cofilin-bound F-actin. Lumenal F-actin can be reconstituted in vitro, but cofilin is not essential. Moreover, actin filaments with both cofilin-bound and canonical morphologies reside within human platelet microtubules under physiological conditions. We propose that stress placed upon the microtubule network during motor-driven microtubule looping and sliding may facilitate the incorporation of actin into microtubules.\nSec7 regulatory domains scaffold autoinhibited and active conformations\nAuthors: Brownfield, B. A.; Richardson, B. C.; Halaby, S. L.; Fromme, J. C.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568272\nThe late stages of Golgi maturation involve a series of sequential trafficking events in which cargo-laden vesicles are produced and targeted to multiple distinct subcellular destinations. Each of these vesicle biogenesis events requires activation of an Arf GTPase by the Sec7/BIG guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Sec7 localization and activity is regulated by autoinhibition, positive feedback, and interaction with other GTPases. Although these mechanisms have been characterized biochemically, we lack a clear picture of how GEF localization and activity is modulated by these signals. Here we report the cryoEM structure of full-length Sec7 in its autoinhibited form, revealing the architecture of its multiple regulatory domains. We use functional experiments to determine the basis for autoinhibition and use structural predictions to produce a model for an active conformation of the GEF that is supported empirically. This study therefore elucidates the conformational transition that Sec7 undergoes to become active on the organelle membrane surface.\nA mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit integrates genome integrity with inflammation\nAuthors: Miller, K. N.; Li, B.; Pierce-Hoffman, H. R.; Lei, X.; Havas, A. P.; Patel, S.; Cano Macip, C.; Victorelli, S. G.; Woo, S.-H.; Lagnado, A. B.; Liu, T.; Dasgupta, N.; Lyu, J.; Altman, Y.; Porritt, R. A.; Garcia, G.; Mogler, C.; Dou, Z.; Chen, C.; Passos, J. F.; Adams, P. D.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567963\nGenomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.\nSelective activation of intracellular β1AR using a spatially restricted antagonist\nAuthors: Liccardo, F.; Morstein, J.; Lin, T.-Y.; Pampel, J.; Shokat, K.; Irannejad, R.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568314\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate several physiological and pathological processes and represent the target of approximately 30% of FDA-approved drugs. GPCR-mediated signaling was thought to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. However, recent studies have unveiled their presence and function at subcellular membrane compartments. There is a growing interest in studying compartmentalized signaling of GPCRs. This requires development of novel tools to separate GPCRs signaling at the plasma membrane from the ones initiated at intracellular compartments. We took advantage of the structural and pharmacological information available for {beta}1-adrenergic receptor ({beta}1AR), an exemplary GPCR that functions at subcellular compartments, and rationally designed spatially restricted antagonists. We generated a cell impermeable {beta}1AR antagonist by conjugating a suitable pharmacophore to a sulfonate-containing fluorophore. This cell-impermeable antagonist only inhibited {beta}1AR on the plasma membrane. In contrast, a cell permeable {beta}1AR agonist containing a non-sulfonated fluorophore, efficiently inhibited both the plasma membrane and Golgi pools of {beta}1ARs. Furthermore, the cell impermeable antagonist selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream effectors of PKA proximal to the plasma membrane in adult cardiomyocytes while {beta}1AR intracellular pool remained active. Our tools offer promising avenues for investigating compartmentalized {beta}1AR signaling in various context, potentially advancing our understanding of {beta}1AR-mediated cellular responses in health and disease. They also offer a general strategy to study compartmentalized signaling for other GPCRs in various biological systems.\nHuman Pancreatic α-Cell Heterogeneity and Trajectory Inference Analysis Using Integrated Single Cell- and Single Nucleus-RNA Sequencing Platforms\nAuthors: Kang, R. B.; Lee, J.; Varela, M.; Li, Y.; Rosselot, C.; Zhang, T.; Karakose, E.; Stewart, A. F.; Scott, D. K.; Garcia-Ocana, A.; Lu, G.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-11-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.567715\nPrior studies have shown that pancreatic -cells can transdifferentiate into {beta}-cells, and that {beta}-cells de-differentiate and are prone to acquire an -cell phenotype in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the specific human -cell and {beta}-cell subtypes that are involved in -to-{beta}-cell and {beta}-to--cell transitions are unknown. Here, we have integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of isolated human islets and human islet grafts and provide additional insight into -{beta} cell fate switching. Using this approach, we make seven novel observations. 1) There are five different GCG-expressing human -cell subclusters [1, 2, -{beta}-transition 1 (AB-Tr1), -{beta}-transition 2 (AB-Tr2), and -{beta} (AB) cluster] with different transcriptome profiles in human islets from non-diabetic donors. 2) The AB subcluster displays multihormonal gene expression, inferred mostly from snRNA-seq data suggesting identification by pre-mRNA expression. 3) The 1, 2, AB-Tr1, and AB-Tr2 subclusters are enriched in genes specific for -cell function while AB cells are enriched in genes related to pancreatic progenitor and {beta}-cell pathways; 4) Trajectory inference analysis of extracted - and {beta}-cell clusters and RNA velocity/PAGA analysis suggests a bifurcate transition potential for AB towards both - and {beta}-cells. 5) Gene commonality analysis identifies ZNF385D, TRPM3, CASR, MEG3 and HDAC9 as signature for trajectories moving towards {beta}-cells and SMOC1, PLCE1, PAPPA2, ZNF331, ALDH1A1, SLC30A8, BTG2, TM4SF4, NR4A1 and PSCK2 as signature for trajectories moving towards -cells. 6) Remarkably, in contrast to the events in vitro, the AB subcluster is not identified in vivo in human islet grafts and trajectory inference analysis suggests only unidirectional transition from -to-{beta}-cells in vivo. 7) Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from adult human T2D donor islets reveals a clear unidirectional transition from {beta}-to--cells compatible with dedifferentiation or conversion into -cells. Collectively, these studies show that snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq can be leveraged to identify transitions in the transcriptional status among human islet endocrine cell subpopulations in vitro, in vivo, in non-diabetes and in T2D. They reveal the potential gene signatures for common trajectories involved in interconversion between - and {beta}-cells and highlight the utility and power of studying single nuclear transcriptomes of human islets in vivo. Most importantly, they illustrate the importance of studying human islets in their natural in vivo setting.\nGerm granule higher-order organization coordinates their different functions\nAuthors: Ramat, A.; Haidar, A.; Garret, C.; Simonelig, M.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568558\nMost RNP condensates are composed of heterogeneous immiscible phases. However, how this multiphase organization contributes to their biological functions remains largely unexplored. Drosophila germ granules, a class of RNP condensates, are the site of mRNA storage and translational activation. Here, using super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that germ granules have a biphasic organization and that translation occurs in the outer phase and at the surface of the granules. The localization, directionality and compaction of mRNAs within the granule depend on their translation status, translated mRNAs being enriched in the outer phase with their 5end oriented towards the surface. Altering germ granule biphasic organization represses translation. These findings demonstrate the importance of RNA granule architecture in organizing different functions, highlighting the functional compartmentalization of RNA granules and the key role of higher-order organization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The sparse and stochastic nature of reprogramming has obscured our understanding of how transcription factors drive cells to new identities. To overcome this limit, we developed a compact, portable reprogramming system that increases direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons by two orders of magnitude. We show that subpopulations with different reprogramming potentials are distinguishable by proliferation history. By controlling for proliferation history and titrating each transcription factor, we find that conversion correlates with levels of the pioneer transcription factor Ngn2, whereas conversion shows a biphasic response to Lhx3. Increasing the proliferation rate of adult human fibroblasts generates morphologically mature, induced motor neurons at high rates. Using compact, optimized, polycistronic cassettes, we generate motor neurons that graft with the murine central nervous system, demonstrating the potential for in vivo therapies.

One Sentence SummaryUsing a systems and synthetic biology approach to study the molecular determinants of reprogramming, we find that proliferation history and transcription factor levels drive cell fate in direct conversion to motor neurons.

        <p class="abstract">SummaryThe individualization of chromosomes during early mitosis and their clustering upon exit from cell division are two key transitions that ensure efficient segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes. Both processes are regulated by the surfactant-like protein Ki-67, but how Ki-67 achieves these diametric functions has remained unknown. Here, we report that Ki-67 radically switches from a chromosome repellent to a chromosome attractant during anaphase. We show that Ki-67 dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and the simultaneous exposure of a conserved basic patch induce the RNA-dependent formation of a liquid-like condensed phase on the chromosome surface. Experiments and coarse-grained simulations support a model in which the coalescence of chromosome surfaces driven by phase separation promote clustering of chromosomes. Our study reveals how the switch of Ki-67 from a surfactant to a liquid-like condensed phase can generate the mechanical forces during genome segregation that are required for re-establishing nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization after mitosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Temperature can impact every reaction and molecular interaction essential to a cell. For organisms that cannot regulate their own temperature, a major challenge is how to adapt to temperatures that fluctuate unpredictability and on variable timescales. Biomolecular condensation offers a possible mechanism for encoding temperature-responsiveness and robustness into cell biochemistry and organization. To explore this idea, we examined temperature adaptation in a filamentous-growing fungus called Ashbya gossypii that engages biomolecular condensates containing the RNA-binding protein Whi3 to regulate mitosis and morphogenesis. We collected wild isolates of Ashbya that originate in different climates and found that mitotic asynchrony and polarized growth, which are known to be controlled by the condensation of Whi3, are temperature sensitive. Sequence analysis in the wild strains revealed changes to specific domains within Whi3 known to be important in condensate formation. Using an in vitro condensate reconstitution assay we found that temperature impacts the relative abundance of protein to RNA within condensates and that this directly impacts the material properties of the droplets. Finally, we found that exchanging Whi3 genes between warm and cold isolates was sufficient to rescue some, but not all, condensate-related phenotypes. Together these data demonstrate that material properties of Whi3 condensates are temperature sensitive, that these properties are important for function, and that sequence optimizes properties for a given climate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for many cellular processes. Recent studies have shown that microtubules and F-actin can assemble to form a composite structure where F-actin occupies the microtubule lumen. Whether these cytoskeletal hybrids exist in physiological settings and how they are formed is unclear. Here, we show that the short-crossover Class I actin filament previously identified inside microtubules in human HAP1 cells is cofilin-bound F-actin. Lumenal F-actin can be reconstituted in vitro, but cofilin is not essential. Moreover, actin filaments with both cofilin-bound and canonical morphologies reside within human platelet microtubules under physiological conditions. We propose that stress placed upon the microtubule network during motor-driven microtubule looping and sliding may facilitate the incorporation of actin into microtubules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The late stages of Golgi maturation involve a series of sequential trafficking events in which cargo-laden vesicles are produced and targeted to multiple distinct subcellular destinations. Each of these vesicle biogenesis events requires activation of an Arf GTPase by the Sec7/BIG guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Sec7 localization and activity is regulated by autoinhibition, positive feedback, and interaction with other GTPases. Although these mechanisms have been characterized biochemically, we lack a clear picture of how GEF localization and activity is modulated by these signals. Here we report the cryoEM structure of full-length Sec7 in its autoinhibited form, revealing the architecture of its multiple regulatory domains. We use functional experiments to determine the basis for autoinhibition and use structural predictions to produce a model for an active conformation of the GEF that is supported empirically. This study therefore elucidates the conformational transition that Sec7 undergoes to become active on the organelle membrane surface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate several physiological and pathological processes and represent the target of approximately 30% of FDA-approved drugs. GPCR-mediated signaling was thought to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. However, recent studies have unveiled their presence and function at subcellular membrane compartments. There is a growing interest in studying compartmentalized signaling of GPCRs. This requires development of novel tools to separate GPCRs signaling at the plasma membrane from the ones initiated at intracellular compartments. We took advantage of the structural and pharmacological information available for {beta}1-adrenergic receptor ({beta}1AR), an exemplary GPCR that functions at subcellular compartments, and rationally designed spatially restricted antagonists. We generated a cell impermeable {beta}1AR antagonist by conjugating a suitable pharmacophore to a sulfonate-containing fluorophore. This cell-impermeable antagonist only inhibited {beta}1AR on the plasma membrane. In contrast, a cell permeable {beta}1AR agonist containing a non-sulfonated fluorophore, efficiently inhibited both the plasma membrane and Golgi pools of {beta}1ARs. Furthermore, the cell impermeable antagonist selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream effectors of PKA proximal to the plasma membrane in adult cardiomyocytes while {beta}1AR intracellular pool remained active. Our tools offer promising avenues for investigating compartmentalized {beta}1AR signaling in various context, potentially advancing our understanding of {beta}1AR-mediated cellular responses in health and disease. They also offer a general strategy to study compartmentalized signaling for other GPCRs in various biological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior studies have shown that pancreatic -cells can transdifferentiate into {beta}-cells, and that {beta}-cells de-differentiate and are prone to acquire an -cell phenotype in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the specific human -cell and {beta}-cell subtypes that are involved in -to-{beta}-cell and {beta}-to--cell transitions are unknown. Here, we have integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of isolated human islets and human islet grafts and provide additional insight into -{beta} cell fate switching. Using this approach, we make seven novel observations. 1) There are five different GCG-expressing human -cell subclusters [1, 2, -{beta}-transition 1 (AB-Tr1), -{beta}-transition 2 (AB-Tr2), and -{beta} (AB) cluster] with different transcriptome profiles in human islets from non-diabetic donors. 2) The AB subcluster displays multihormonal gene expression, inferred mostly from snRNA-seq data suggesting identification by pre-mRNA expression. 3) The 1, 2, AB-Tr1, and AB-Tr2 subclusters are enriched in genes specific for -cell function while AB cells are enriched in genes related to pancreatic progenitor and {beta}-cell pathways; 4) Trajectory inference analysis of extracted - and {beta}-cell clusters and RNA velocity/PAGA analysis suggests a bifurcate transition potential for AB towards both - and {beta}-cells. 5) Gene commonality analysis identifies ZNF385D, TRPM3, CASR, MEG3 and HDAC9 as signature for trajectories moving towards {beta}-cells and SMOC1, PLCE1, PAPPA2, ZNF331, ALDH1A1, SLC30A8, BTG2, TM4SF4, NR4A1 and PSCK2 as signature for trajectories moving towards -cells. 6) Remarkably, in contrast to the events in vitro, the AB subcluster is not identified in vivo in human islet grafts and trajectory inference analysis suggests only unidirectional transition from -to-{beta}-cells in vivo. 7) Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from adult human T2D donor islets reveals a clear unidirectional transition from {beta}-to--cells compatible with dedifferentiation or conversion into -cells. Collectively, these studies show that snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq can be leveraged to identify transitions in the transcriptional status among human islet endocrine cell subpopulations in vitro, in vivo, in non-diabetes and in T2D. They reveal the potential gene signatures for common trajectories involved in interconversion between - and {beta}-cells and highlight the utility and power of studying single nuclear transcriptomes of human islets in vivo. Most importantly, they illustrate the importance of studying human islets in their natural in vivo setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most RNP condensates are composed of heterogeneous immiscible phases. However, how this multiphase organization contributes to their biological functions remains largely unexplored. Drosophila germ granules, a class of RNP condensates, are the site of mRNA storage and translational activation. Here, using super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that germ granules have a biphasic organization and that translation occurs in the outer phase and at the surface of the granules. The localization, directionality and compaction of mRNAs within the granule depend on their translation status, translated mRNAs being enriched in the outer phase with their 5end oriented towards the surface. Altering germ granule biphasic organization represses translation. These findings demonstrate the importance of RNA granule architecture in organizing different functions, highlighting the functional compartmentalization of RNA granules and the key role of higher-order organization.</p>
