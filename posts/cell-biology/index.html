To ensure the transmission process, interphase chromatin is further condensed into mitotic chromosomes. Although protein factors like condensins and topoisomerase IIa are involved in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, the physical bases of the condensation process remain unclear. Macromolecular crowding/depletion force, an effective attractive force that arises between large structures in crowded environments around chromosomes, may contribute to the condensation process. To approach this issue, we investigated the \"chromosome milieu\" during mitosis of living human cells using orientation-independent-differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) module combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, which is capable of precisely mapping optical path differences and estimating molecular densities. We found that the molecular density surrounding chromosomes increased with the mitotic progression from prometaphase to anaphase, concurring with chromosome condensation. However, the molecular density went down in telophase, when chromosome decondensation began. Changes in the molecular density around chromosomes by hypotonic or hypertonic treatment consistently altered the condensation levels of chromosomes. In vitro, native chromatin was converted into liquid droplets of chromatin in the presence of cations and a macromolecular crowder. Additional crowder made the chromatin droplets stiffer and more solid-like, with further condensation. These results suggest that a transient rise in macromolecular crowding (proteins and RNAs), likely triggered by the relocation of macromolecules via nuclear envelope breakdown and by a subsequent decrease in cell-volumes, contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation, shedding light on a new aspect of the condensation mechanism in living human cells.\nChange in RhoGAP and RhoGEF availability drives transitions in cortical patterning and excitability in Drosophila\nAuthors: Jackson, J. A.; Denk-Lobnig, M.; Kitzinger, K. A.; Martin, A. C.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565883\nActin cortex patterning and dynamics are critical for cell shape changes. These dynamics undergo transitions during development, often accompanying changes in collective cell behavior. While mechanisms have been established for individual cells dynamic behaviors, mechanisms and specific molecules that result in developmental transitions in vivo are still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of two developmental systems in Drosophila melanogaster to identify conditions that altered cortical patterning and dynamics. We identified a RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair whose relocalization from nucleus to cortex results in actomyosin waves in egg chambers. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of a different RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair resulted in actomyosin waves in the early embryo, during which RhoA activation precedes actomyosin assembly and RhoGAP recruitment by [~]4 seconds. Overall, we showed a mechanism involved in inducing actomyosin waves that is essential for oocyte development and is general to other cell types.\nCharacterisation and correction of polarisation effects in fluorescently labelled fibres\nAuthors: Aggarwal, N.; Marsh, R.; Marcotti, S.; Shaw, T. J.; Stramer, B.; Cox, S.; Culley, S.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566047\nMany biological structures take the form of fibres and filaments, and quantitative analysis of fibre organisation is important for understanding their functions in both normal physiological conditions and disease. In order to visualise these structures, fibres can be fluorescently labelled and imaged, with specialised image analysis methods available for quantifying the degree and strength of fibre alignment. Here we show that fluorescently labelled fibres can display polarised emission, with the strength of this effect varying depending on structure and fluorophore identity. This can bias automated analysis of fibre alignment and mask the true underlying structural organisation. We present a method for quantifying and correcting these polarisation effects without requiring polarisation resolved microscopy, and demonstrate its efficacy when applied to images of fluorescently labelled collagen gels, allowing for more reliable characterisation of fibre microarchitecture.\nAn interaction hub on Ndc80 complex facilitates dynamic recruitment of Mps1 to yeast kinetochores to promote accurate chromosome segregation\nAuthors: Parnell, E. J.; Jenson, E.; Miller, M. P.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566082\nAccurate chromosome segregation relies on kinetochores carrying out multiple functions, including establishing and maintaining microtubule attachments, forming precise bioriented attachments between sister chromatids, and activating the spindle assembly checkpoint. Central to these processes is the highly conserved Ndc80 complex. This kinetochore subcomplex interacts directly with microtubules, but also serves as a critical platform for recruiting kinetochore-associated factors and as a key substrate for error correction kinases. The precise manner in which these kinetochore factors interact, and regulate each others function, remains unknown - considerably hindering our understanding of how Ndc80 complex-dependent processes function together to orchestrate accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we aimed to uncover the role of Nuf2s CH domain, a component of the Ndc80 complex, in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Through extensive mutational analysis, we identified a conserved \"interaction hub\" comprising two segments in Nuf2s CH domain, forming the binding site for Mps1 within the yeast Ndc80 complex. Intriguingly, the interaction between Mps1 and the Ndc80 complex seems to be subject to regulation by competitive binding with other factors. Mutants disrupting this interaction hub exhibit defects in spindle assembly checkpoint function and severe chromosome segregation errors. Significantly, specifically restoring Mps1-Ndc80 complex association rescues these defects. Our findings shed light on the intricate regulation of Ndc80 complex-dependent functions and highlight the essential role of Mps1 in kinetochore biorientation and accurate chromosome segregation.\nDivergent Protein Kinase A contributes to the regulation of flagellar waveform of the motile flagellum of Leishmania mexicana\nAuthors: Fochler, S.; Walker, B. J.; Wheeler, R. J.; Gluenz, E.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566240\nProtein kinase A (PKA) is one of the most studied eukaryotic signal transducers and a key target of the second messenger cAMP. Kinetoplastids, a branch of early diverging eukaryotes, possess homologues of catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits that, unusually, are insensitive to cAMP with uncertainty about the endogenous activating ligand. While previous evidence has implicated both cAMP and PKA in the regulation of flagellar motility in kinetoplastids, the specific contributions of the two regulatory (PKAR) and three catalytic (PKAC) subunits of PKA remain unclear. Here we conducted a systematic study combining reverse genetics and microscopy analysis to investigate PKAC and PKAR subcellular localisations, pairing preferences, and the effect of PKA gene deletions on swimming speed and flagellar waveforms in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. LmxPKAC1, LmxPKAC2 and LmxPKAR1 are enriched in the flagellum and upon detergent extraction, the LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAC1 signals remained associated with the cytoskeleton. The flagellar LmxPKAC1 and LmxPKAC2 signals were, however, greatly diminished by removal of LmxPKAR1, consistent with an anchoring function for the R-subunit. Previous work identified the Streptomyces antimetabolite toyocamycin, activated the divergent PKA of Trypanosoma brucei. The patterns of sequence divergence within the phosphate binding cassettes of LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAR3 suggest both are divergent from T. brucei. We therefore tested the effect of toyocamycin and a similarly structured compound of the purine metabolism pathway, inosine, on the localisation of LmxPKAC1 and found that the LmxPKAC1 mNG signal was lost from the cytoskeletal fraction following treatment with either toyocamycin or inosine. LmxPKAC3 and LmxPKAR3 were localised to the cell cortex. Upon removal of LmxPKAR3, LmxPKAC3 was lost from the cortex and became distributed throughout the cell, including an increased presence in the flagellum. Assessing motility phenotypes, we found this increase of LmxPKAC3 signal in the flagellum correlated with an increase in swimming speed. Whereas the deletion of LmxPKAC3 resulted in flagella beating at significantly reduced frequencies and a resulting decrease in population swimming speed. Moreover, LmxPKAC1 null mutants showed a significantly reduced swimming speed and cells were unable to produce symmetric flagellar waves. Taken together these data indicate that the divergent PKA pathway in Leishmania modulates flagellar motility. Author SummaryMany cells use whip-like cellular appendages, called flagella, for swimming. Regulating the rhythm and strength of the flagellar beat is important to determine the speed at which cells swim and in what direction they move. How this regulation is accomplished is not fully understood. Here we examined the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in flagellar motility of the unicellular parasite Leishmania. Leishmania have three catalytic PKA proteins, which transduce upstream signals through protein phosphorylation, and two regulatory PKA proteins that serve to anchor the catalytic subunits to specific locations within the cell. We show that two catalytic and one regulatory subunit are part of the flagellar cytoskeleton, while the other regulatory subunit docks its catalytic subunit to the cytoskeleton surrounding the cell body. Removal of individual PKA proteins perturbed the flagellar beat in different ways. We found that cells that lacked the catalytic subunit PKAC1 could only beat their flagella in an uncoordinated manner and as a consequence swam more slowly. These findings suggest that Leishmania PKA proteins are part of a pathway that regulates flagellar beating.\nIpl1-controlled attachment maturation regulates Mps1 association with its kinetochore receptor\nAuthors: Pleuger, R.; Cozma, C.; Hohoff, S.; Denkhaus, C.; Dudziak, A.; Kaschani, F.; Musacchio, A.; Vetter, I. R.; Westermann, S.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564738\nFaithful chromosome segregation requires that sister chromatids establish bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature anaphase onset with incomplete attachments. However, how microtubule attachment and checkpoint signaling are coordinated remains unclear. The conserved kinase Mps1 initiates SAC signaling by localizing transiently to kinetochores in prometaphase and is released upon bi-orientation. Using biochemistry, structure predictions, and cellular assays, we shed light on this dynamic behaviour in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A conserved N-terminal segment of Mps1 binds the neck region of Ndc80:Nuf2, the main microtubule receptor of kinetochores. Mutational disruption of this interface, located at the backside of the paired CH-domains and opposite the microtubule-binding site, prevents Mps1 localization, eliminates SAC signalling, and impairs growth. The same interface of Ndc80:Nuf2 binds the microtubule-associated Dam1 complex. We demonstrate that the error correction kinase Ipl1/Aurora B controls the competition between Dam1 and Mps1 for the same binding site. Thus, binding of the Dam1 complex to Ndc80:Nuf2 may release Mps1 from the kinetochore to allow anaphase onset.\nVault particles are common contaminants of extracellular vesicle preparations\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Nizamudeen, Z.; Hill, C. J.; Parmenter, C.; Arkill, K. P.; Lambert, D. W.; Hunt, S.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566362\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) may contain a variety of molecular cargo including proteins and nucleic acids. Vault particle components have been repeatedly reported in the literature as EV cargo. Here, we demonstrated by small RNA sequencing that vault RNA (vtRNA) were highly abundant in EV pellets enriched by differential centrifugation. EVs were prepared by commonly used enrichment methods and biochemical assays used to determine whether vault particle components were bona fide EV cargo. EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Dynabead immunocapture. RNase and proteinase treatment of EV preparations demonstrated that most vtRNA and major vault protein (MVP) were not enclosed and protected within the EV membrane. Vault-like particles were visualised in differential centrifugation pellets by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. EVs enriched by size exclusion chromatography and those isolated by immunocapture post-ultracentrifugation showed co-purification of MVP, whereas EVs isolated by direct immunocapture from conditioned medium were MVP-negative. Taken together, commonly used isolation techniques, such as differential centrifugation and SEC, can lead to contamination of EVs with vault particles. The current study highlights the importance of determining the topology of putative EV-associated components to determine if they are EV cargo or contaminants that have been co-purified.\nDLG1 functions upstream of SDCCAG3 and IFT20 to control targeting of polycystin-2 to the primary cilium\nAuthors: Rezi, C. K.; Aslanyan, M.; Diwan, G. D.; Cheng, T.; Chamlali, M.; Junger, K.; Anvarian, Z.; Lorentzen, E.; Pauly, K. B.; Bahadori, Y.; Fernandes, E. F.; Qian, F.; Tosi, S.; Christensen, S. T.; Pedersen, S. F.; Stromgaard, K.; Russell, R. B.; Miner, J. H.; Mahjoub, M. R.; Boldt, K.; Roepman, R.; Pedersen, L. B.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566524\nPolarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to the primary cilium, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we identify a key role for discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1 (DLG1), a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, serologically defined colon cancer antigen-3 (SDCCAG3) and intraflagellar transport protein 20 (IFT20), previously implicated in ciliary targeting of polycystin-2 (PC2), as well as PC2 itself, were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 missense variant. Moreover, using biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling we provide evidence that DLG1 associates physically with SDCCAG3 and IFT20, which in turn bind directly to each other. Our work thus identifies a key role for DLG1 in mediating ciliary targeting of PC2 and other proteins and implicates ciliary dysfunction as a possible contributing factor to CAKUT.\nThe immune landscape of murine skeletal muscle regeneration and aging\nAuthors: Sousa, N.

L.; Sousa-Victor, P.; Neves, J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.565995\nAge-related alterations in the immune system are starting to emerge as key contributors to impairments found in aged organs. A decline in regenerative capacity is a hallmark of tissue aging, however the contribution of immune aging to regenerative failure is just starting to be explored. Here, we applied a strategy combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with flow cytometry and functional assays to perform a complete analysis of the immune environment in the aged regenerating skeletal muscle, with time and single cell resolution. Our results identified previously undescribed immune cell types in the skeletal muscle and revealed an unanticipated complexity and functional heterogeneity in immune populations, that have been regarded as homogeneous. Furthermore, we uncovered a profound remodeling of both myeloid and lymphoid compartments in aging. These discoveries challenge established notions on immune regulation of skeletal muscle regeneration, providing a new set of potential targets to improve skeletal muscle health and regenerative capacity in aging.\nMyospreader improves gene editing in skeletal muscle by myonuclear propagation\nAuthors: Poukalov, K.; Valero, M. C.; Muscato, D.; Adams, L.; Chun, H.; Lee, Y. i. T.; Andrade, N.; Zeier, Z.; Sweeney, H. L.; Wang, E. T.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565807\nSuccessful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify \"Myospreader\", a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Genomic information must be faithfully transmitted into two daughter cells during cell division. To ensure the transmission process, interphase chromatin is further condensed into mitotic chromosomes. Although protein factors like condensins and topoisomerase IIa are involved in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, the physical bases of the condensation process remain unclear. Macromolecular crowding/depletion force, an effective attractive force that arises between large structures in crowded environments around chromosomes, may contribute to the condensation process. To approach this issue, we investigated the &#34;chromosome milieu&#34; during mitosis of living human cells using orientation-independent-differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) module combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, which is capable of precisely mapping optical path differences and estimating molecular densities. We found that the molecular density surrounding chromosomes increased with the mitotic progression from prometaphase to anaphase, concurring with chromosome condensation. However, the molecular density went down in telophase, when chromosome decondensation began. Changes in the molecular density around chromosomes by hypotonic or hypertonic treatment consistently altered the condensation levels of chromosomes. In vitro, native chromatin was converted into liquid droplets of chromatin in the presence of cations and a macromolecular crowder. Additional crowder made the chromatin droplets stiffer and more solid-like, with further condensation. These results suggest that a transient rise in macromolecular crowding (proteins and RNAs), likely triggered by the relocation of macromolecules via nuclear envelope breakdown and by a subsequent decrease in cell-volumes, contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation, shedding light on a new aspect of the condensation mechanism in living human cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Actin cortex patterning and dynamics are critical for cell shape changes. These dynamics undergo transitions during development, often accompanying changes in collective cell behavior. While mechanisms have been established for individual cells dynamic behaviors, mechanisms and specific molecules that result in developmental transitions in vivo are still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of two developmental systems in Drosophila melanogaster to identify conditions that altered cortical patterning and dynamics. We identified a RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair whose relocalization from nucleus to cortex results in actomyosin waves in egg chambers. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of a different RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair resulted in actomyosin waves in the early embryo, during which RhoA activation precedes actomyosin assembly and RhoGAP recruitment by [~]4 seconds. Overall, we showed a mechanism involved in inducing actomyosin waves that is essential for oocyte development and is general to other cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many biological structures take the form of fibres and filaments, and quantitative analysis of fibre organisation is important for understanding their functions in both normal physiological conditions and disease. In order to visualise these structures, fibres can be fluorescently labelled and imaged, with specialised image analysis methods available for quantifying the degree and strength of fibre alignment. Here we show that fluorescently labelled fibres can display polarised emission, with the strength of this effect varying depending on structure and fluorophore identity. This can bias automated analysis of fibre alignment and mask the true underlying structural organisation. We present a method for quantifying and correcting these polarisation effects without requiring polarisation resolved microscopy, and demonstrate its efficacy when applied to images of fluorescently labelled collagen gels, allowing for more reliable characterisation of fibre microarchitecture.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate chromosome segregation relies on kinetochores carrying out multiple functions, including establishing and maintaining microtubule attachments, forming precise bioriented attachments between sister chromatids, and activating the spindle assembly checkpoint. Central to these processes is the highly conserved Ndc80 complex. This kinetochore subcomplex interacts directly with microtubules, but also serves as a critical platform for recruiting kinetochore-associated factors and as a key substrate for error correction kinases. The precise manner in which these kinetochore factors interact, and regulate each others function, remains unknown - considerably hindering our understanding of how Ndc80 complex-dependent processes function together to orchestrate accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we aimed to uncover the role of Nuf2s CH domain, a component of the Ndc80 complex, in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Through extensive mutational analysis, we identified a conserved &#34;interaction hub&#34; comprising two segments in Nuf2s CH domain, forming the binding site for Mps1 within the yeast Ndc80 complex. Intriguingly, the interaction between Mps1 and the Ndc80 complex seems to be subject to regulation by competitive binding with other factors. Mutants disrupting this interaction hub exhibit defects in spindle assembly checkpoint function and severe chromosome segregation errors. Significantly, specifically restoring Mps1-Ndc80 complex association rescues these defects. Our findings shed light on the intricate regulation of Ndc80 complex-dependent functions and highlight the essential role of Mps1 in kinetochore biorientation and accurate chromosome segregation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein kinase A (PKA) is one of the most studied eukaryotic signal transducers and a key target of the second messenger cAMP. Kinetoplastids, a branch of early diverging eukaryotes, possess homologues of catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits that, unusually, are insensitive to cAMP with uncertainty about the endogenous activating ligand. While previous evidence has implicated both cAMP and PKA in the regulation of flagellar motility in kinetoplastids, the specific contributions of the two regulatory (PKAR) and three catalytic (PKAC) subunits of PKA remain unclear. Here we conducted a systematic study combining reverse genetics and microscopy analysis to investigate PKAC and PKAR subcellular localisations, pairing preferences, and the effect of PKA gene deletions on swimming speed and flagellar waveforms in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. LmxPKAC1, LmxPKAC2 and LmxPKAR1 are enriched in the flagellum and upon detergent extraction, the LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAC1 signals remained associated with the cytoskeleton. The flagellar LmxPKAC1 and LmxPKAC2 signals were, however, greatly diminished by removal of LmxPKAR1, consistent with an anchoring function for the R-subunit. Previous work identified the Streptomyces antimetabolite toyocamycin, activated the divergent PKA of Trypanosoma brucei. The patterns of sequence divergence within the phosphate binding cassettes of LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAR3 suggest both are divergent from T. brucei. We therefore tested the effect of toyocamycin and a similarly structured compound of the purine metabolism pathway, inosine, on the localisation of LmxPKAC1 and found that the LmxPKAC1 mNG signal was lost from the cytoskeletal fraction following treatment with either toyocamycin or inosine. LmxPKAC3 and LmxPKAR3 were localised to the cell cortex. Upon removal of LmxPKAR3, LmxPKAC3 was lost from the cortex and became distributed throughout the cell, including an increased presence in the flagellum. Assessing motility phenotypes, we found this increase of LmxPKAC3 signal in the flagellum correlated with an increase in swimming speed. Whereas the deletion of LmxPKAC3 resulted in flagella beating at significantly reduced frequencies and a resulting decrease in population swimming speed. Moreover, LmxPKAC1 null mutants showed a significantly reduced swimming speed and cells were unable to produce symmetric flagellar waves. Taken together these data indicate that the divergent PKA pathway in Leishmania modulates flagellar motility.

Author SummaryMany cells use whip-like cellular appendages, called flagella, for swimming. Regulating the rhythm and strength of the flagellar beat is important to determine the speed at which cells swim and in what direction they move. How this regulation is accomplished is not fully understood. Here we examined the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in flagellar motility of the unicellular parasite Leishmania. Leishmania have three catalytic PKA proteins, which transduce upstream signals through protein phosphorylation, and two regulatory PKA proteins that serve to anchor the catalytic subunits to specific locations within the cell. We show that two catalytic and one regulatory subunit are part of the flagellar cytoskeleton, while the other regulatory subunit docks its catalytic subunit to the cytoskeleton surrounding the cell body. Removal of individual PKA proteins perturbed the flagellar beat in different ways. We found that cells that lacked the catalytic subunit PKAC1 could only beat their flagella in an uncoordinated manner and as a consequence swam more slowly. These findings suggest that Leishmania PKA proteins are part of a pathway that regulates flagellar beating.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Faithful chromosome segregation requires that sister chromatids establish bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature anaphase onset with incomplete attachments. However, how microtubule attachment and checkpoint signaling are coordinated remains unclear. The conserved kinase Mps1 initiates SAC signaling by localizing transiently to kinetochores in prometaphase and is released upon bi-orientation. Using biochemistry, structure predictions, and cellular assays, we shed light on this dynamic behaviour in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A conserved N-terminal segment of Mps1 binds the neck region of Ndc80:Nuf2, the main microtubule receptor of kinetochores. Mutational disruption of this interface, located at the backside of the paired CH-domains and opposite the microtubule-binding site, prevents Mps1 localization, eliminates SAC signalling, and impairs growth. The same interface of Ndc80:Nuf2 binds the microtubule-associated Dam1 complex. We demonstrate that the error correction kinase Ipl1/Aurora B controls the competition between Dam1 and Mps1 for the same binding site. Thus, binding of the Dam1 complex to Ndc80:Nuf2 may release Mps1 from the kinetochore to allow anaphase onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may contain a variety of molecular cargo including proteins and nucleic acids. Vault particle components have been repeatedly reported in the literature as EV cargo. Here, we demonstrated by small RNA sequencing that vault RNA (vtRNA) were highly abundant in EV pellets enriched by differential centrifugation. EVs were prepared by commonly used enrichment methods and biochemical assays used to determine whether vault particle components were bona fide EV cargo. EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Dynabead immunocapture. RNase and proteinase treatment of EV preparations demonstrated that most vtRNA and major vault protein (MVP) were not enclosed and protected within the EV membrane. Vault-like particles were visualised in differential centrifugation pellets by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. EVs enriched by size exclusion chromatography and those isolated by immunocapture post-ultracentrifugation showed co-purification of MVP, whereas EVs isolated by direct immunocapture from conditioned medium were MVP-negative. Taken together, commonly used isolation techniques, such as differential centrifugation and SEC, can lead to contamination of EVs with vault particles. The current study highlights the importance of determining the topology of putative EV-associated components to determine if they are EV cargo or contaminants that have been co-purified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to the primary cilium, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we identify a key role for discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1 (DLG1), a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, serologically defined colon cancer antigen-3 (SDCCAG3) and intraflagellar transport protein 20 (IFT20), previously implicated in ciliary targeting of polycystin-2 (PC2), as well as PC2 itself, were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 missense variant. Moreover, using biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling we provide evidence that DLG1 associates physically with SDCCAG3 and IFT20, which in turn bind directly to each other. Our work thus identifies a key role for DLG1 in mediating ciliary targeting of PC2 and other proteins and implicates ciliary dysfunction as a possible contributing factor to CAKUT.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-related alterations in the immune system are starting to emerge as key contributors to impairments found in aged organs. A decline in regenerative capacity is a hallmark of tissue aging, however the contribution of immune aging to regenerative failure is just starting to be explored. Here, we applied a strategy combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with flow cytometry and functional assays to perform a complete analysis of the immune environment in the aged regenerating skeletal muscle, with time and single cell resolution. Our results identified previously undescribed immune cell types in the skeletal muscle and revealed an unanticipated complexity and functional heterogeneity in immune populations, that have been regarded as homogeneous. Furthermore, we uncovered a profound remodeling of both myeloid and lymphoid compartments in aging. These discoveries challenge established notions on immune regulation of skeletal muscle regeneration, providing a new set of potential targets to improve skeletal muscle health and regenerative capacity in aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Successful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify &#34;Myospreader&#34;, a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.</p>
