P.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549521\nTepsin is an established accessory protein found in Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) coated vesicles, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. AP-4 vesicles originate at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and target the delivery of ATG9A, a scramblase required for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. Using in silico methods, we identified a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif in tepsin. Biochemical experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicate tepsin directly binds LC3B, but not other members, of the mammalian ATG8 family. Calorimetry and structural modeling data indicate this interaction occurs with micromolar affinity using the established LC3B LIR docking site. Loss of tepsin in cultured cells dysregulates ATG9A export from the TGN as well as ATG9A distribution at the cell periphery. Tepsin depletion in a mRFP-GFP-LC3B HeLa reporter cell line using siRNA knockdown increases autophagosome volume and number, but does not appear to affect flux through the autophagic pathway. Re-introduction of wild-type tepsin partially rescues ATG9A cargo trafficking defects. In contrast, re-introducing tepsin with a mutated LIR motif or missing N-terminus does not fully rescue altered ATG9A subcellular distribution. Together, these data suggest roles for tepsin in cargo export from the TGN; delivery of ATG9A-positive vesicles at the cell periphery; and in overall maintenance of autophagosome structure.\nmRNA condensation fluidizes the cytoplasm\nAuthors: Xie, Y.; Liu, T.; Gresham, D.; Holt, L. J.\nScore: 73.7, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.542963\nThe intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.\nThree-step docking by WIPI2, ATG16L1 and ATG3 delivers LC3 to the phagophore\nAuthors: Rao, S.; Strong, L. M.; Ren, X.; Skulsuppaisarn, M.; Lazarou, M.; Hurley, J. H.; Hummer, G.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549391\nThe covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12- ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.\nA signalling rheostat controls chromosome segregation fidelity during early lineage specification and neurogenesis by modulating DNA replication stress\nAuthors: de Jaime Soguero, A.; Hattemer, J.; Haas, A.; Bufe, A.; Di Marco, B.; Bohly, N.; Landry, J.

P.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549463\nThe development and homeostasis of organisms rely on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of their genetic blueprints. How these intracellular processes are monitored across generations of different human cellular lineages, and why the spatio-temporal distribution of mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Here, we identify several lineage specification signals that regulate chromosome segregation fidelity in both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. Through epistatic analyses, we find that that WNT, BMP and FGF form a signalling \"rheostat\" upstream of ATM that monitors replication fork velocity, origin firing and DNA damage during S-phase in pluripotency, which in turn controls spindle polymerisation dynamics and faithful chromosome segregation in the following mitosis. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation fidelity declines together with ATM activity after pluripotency exit and specification into the three human germ layers, or further differentiation into meso- and endoderm lineages, but re-emerges during neuronal lineage specification. In particular, we reveal that a tug-of-war between FGF and WNT signalling in neural progenitor cells results in DNA damage and chromosome missegregation during cortical neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the high levels of mosaicism in the human brain. Our results highlight a moonlighting role of morphogens, patterning signals and growth factors in genome maintenance during pluripotency and lineage specification, which could have important implications for our understanding on how mutations and aneuploidy arise during human development and disease.

E.; Cannon, K. S.; Kovar, D. R.; Brown, N. G.; Gupton, S. L.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549237\nThe actin cytoskeleton performs multiple cellular functions, and as such, actin polymerization must be tightly regulated. We previously demonstrated that reversible, non-degradative ubiquitination regulates the function of the actin polymerase VASP in developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism of how ubiquitination impacts VASP activity was unknown. Here we show that mimicking multi-monoubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 negatively regulates VASP interactions with actin. Using in vitro bio-chemical assays, we demonstrate the reduced ability of multi-monoubiquitinated VASP to bind, bundle, and elongate actin fil-aments. However, multi-monoubiquitinated VASP maintained the ability to bind and protect barbed ends from capping protein. Lastly, we demonstrate the introduction of recombinant multi-monoubiquitinated VASP protein altered cell spreading morphology. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism in which ubiquitination controls VASP-mediated actin dynamics.\nGeneration of an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a healthy adult indigenous Nigerian participant\nAuthors: Muhammad, Z.; Brown, P.

B.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550059\nGenetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.\nThe cellular landscape of the endochondral bone highlights its multipotent and immunomodulatory features during the transition to extrauterine life\nAuthors: Rueda, A. D.; Salvador-Martinez, I.; Sospedra-Arrufat, I.; Alcaina-Caro, A.; Fernandez-Minan, A.; Burgos-Ruiz, A. M.; Cases, I.; Mohedano, A.; Tena, J.

While the adult bone has received significant attention, we still lack a deep understanding of the perinatal bone cellulome. Here, we have profiled the full composition of the murine endochondral bone at the single-cell level during the transition from fetal to newborn life and in comparison to the adult organ, with particular emphasis on the mesenchymal compartment. The perinatal bone contains different fibroblastic clusters with blastema-like characteristics in organizing and supporting skeletogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Our data also points out to a dynamic inter- and intra-compartment interactions as well as a bone marrow milieu prone to anti-inflammation, which we hypothesize is necessary to ensure the proper program of lymphopoiesis and the establishment of central and peripheral tolerance in early life. Our study provides a integrative roadmap for the future design of genetic and cellular functional assays to validate cellular interactions and lineage relationships within the perinatal bone.\nCardiomyocyte mechanical memory is regulated through the talin interactome and DLC1 dependent regulation of RhoA\nAuthors: Marhuenda, E.; Xanthis, I.; Pandey, P.; Azad, A.; Richter, M.; Pavlovic, D.; Gehmlich, K.; Faggian, G.; Ehler, E.; Levitt, J.; Ameer-Beg, S.; Iskratsch, T.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549635\nMechanical properties are cues for many biological processes in health or disease. Likewise, in the heart it is becoming clearer that mechanical signals are critically involved in the disease progression. Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment at costameres through integrins and associated proteins, including the mechanosensitive protein talin as an integral component. Our previous work indicated different modes of talin tension, depending on the extracellular matrix stiffness. Here, we wanted to study how this leads to downstream mechanotransduction changes, further influencing the cardiomyocyte phenotype. Combining immunoprecipitations and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1, RIAM and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at specific extracellular matrix stiffness and this interaction is preserved even in absence of tension. This demonstrates a mechanical memory, which we confirm further in vivo in mouse hearts. The mechanical memory is regulated through adhesion related kinase pathways. Optogenetic experiments using the LOVTRAP systems confirm direct competition between the individual proteins, which again is altered through phosphorylation. DLC1 regulates RhoA activity in a stiffness dependent way and both loss and overexpression of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together the study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin-interactome to finetune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.\nPolyubiquitinated PCNA promotes alternative lengthening of telomeres by inducing break-induced replication\nAuthors: Kim, S.; Kang, N.; Ra, J. S.; Park, S. H.; Myung, K.; Lee, K.-y.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548953\nReplication stresses are the major source of break-induced replication (BIR). Here, we show that in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells, replication stress-induced polyubiquitinated PCNA (polyUb-PCNA) triggers BIR at telomeres and the common fragile site (CFS). Consistently, depleting RAD18, a PCNA ubiquitinating enzyme, reduces the occurrence of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres and CFS, both of which are mediated by BIR. In contrast, inhibiting USP1, an Ub-PCNA deubiquitinating enzyme, results in an increase in the above phenotypes in a RAD18- and UBC13 (the PCNA polyubiquitinating enzyme)-dependent manner. Furthermore, deficiency of ATAD5, which facilitates USP1 activity and unloads PCNAs, augments recombination-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, telomeric polyUb-PCNA accumulates SLX4, a nuclease scaffold, at telomeres through its ubiquitin-binding domain and increases telomere damage. Consistently, APB increase induced by Ub-PCNA depends on SLX4 and SLX4-associated nucleases. Taken together, our results identified the polyUb-PCNA-SLX4 axis as a trigger for directing BIR.\nFrom Pixels to Phenotypes: Integrating Image-Based Profiling with Cell Health Data Improves Interpretability\nAuthors: Seal, S.; Carreras-Puigvert, J.; Carpenter, A. E.; Spjuth, O.; Bender, A.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549031\nCell Painting assays generate morphological profiles that are versatile descriptors of biological systems and have been used to predict in vitro and in vivo drug effects. However, Cell Painting features are based on image statistics, and are, therefore, often not readily biologically interpretable. In this study, we introduce an approach that maps specific Cell Painting features into the BioMorph space using readouts from comprehensive Cell Health assays. We validated that the resulting BioMorph space effectively connected compounds not only with the morphological features associated with their bioactivity but with deeper insights into phenotypic characteristics and cellular processes associated with the given bioactivity. The BioMorph space revealed the mechanism of action for individual compounds, including dual-acting compounds such as emetine, an inhibitor of both protein synthesis and DNA replication. In summary, BioMorph space offers a more biologically relevant way to interpret cell morphological features from the Cell Painting assays and to generate hypotheses for experimental validation.

        <p class="abstract">Tepsin is an established accessory protein found in Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) coated vesicles, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. AP-4 vesicles originate at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and target the delivery of ATG9A, a scramblase required for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. Using in silico methods, we identified a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif in tepsin. Biochemical experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicate tepsin directly binds LC3B, but not other members, of the mammalian ATG8 family. Calorimetry and structural modeling data indicate this interaction occurs with micromolar affinity using the established LC3B LIR docking site. Loss of tepsin in cultured cells dysregulates ATG9A export from the TGN as well as ATG9A distribution at the cell periphery. Tepsin depletion in a mRFP-GFP-LC3B HeLa reporter cell line using siRNA knockdown increases autophagosome volume and number, but does not appear to affect flux through the autophagic pathway. Re-introduction of wild-type tepsin partially rescues ATG9A cargo trafficking defects. In contrast, re-introducing tepsin with a mutated LIR motif or missing N-terminus does not fully rescue altered ATG9A subcellular distribution. Together, these data suggest roles for tepsin in cargo export from the TGN; delivery of ATG9A-positive vesicles at the cell periphery; and in overall maintenance of autophagosome structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12- ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development and homeostasis of organisms rely on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of their genetic blueprints. How these intracellular processes are monitored across generations of different human cellular lineages, and why the spatio-temporal distribution of mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Here, we identify several lineage specification signals that regulate chromosome segregation fidelity in both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. Through epistatic analyses, we find that that WNT, BMP and FGF form a signalling &#34;rheostat&#34; upstream of ATM that monitors replication fork velocity, origin firing and DNA damage during S-phase in pluripotency, which in turn controls spindle polymerisation dynamics and faithful chromosome segregation in the following mitosis. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation fidelity declines together with ATM activity after pluripotency exit and specification into the three human germ layers, or further differentiation into meso- and endoderm lineages, but re-emerges during neuronal lineage specification. In particular, we reveal that a tug-of-war between FGF and WNT signalling in neural progenitor cells results in DNA damage and chromosome missegregation during cortical neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the high levels of mosaicism in the human brain. Our results highlight a moonlighting role of morphogens, patterning signals and growth factors in genome maintenance during pluripotency and lineage specification, which could have important implications for our understanding on how mutations and aneuploidy arise during human development and disease.

        <p class="abstract">The actin cytoskeleton performs multiple cellular functions, and as such, actin polymerization must be tightly regulated. We previously demonstrated that reversible, non-degradative ubiquitination regulates the function of the actin polymerase VASP in developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism of how ubiquitination impacts VASP activity was unknown. Here we show that mimicking multi-monoubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 negatively regulates VASP interactions with actin. Using in vitro bio-chemical assays, we demonstrate the reduced ability of multi-monoubiquitinated VASP to bind, bundle, and elongate actin fil-aments. However, multi-monoubiquitinated VASP maintained the ability to bind and protect barbed ends from capping protein. Lastly, we demonstrate the introduction of recombinant multi-monoubiquitinated VASP protein altered cell spreading morphology. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism in which ubiquitination controls VASP-mediated actin dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cellular complexity of the endochondral bone underlies its essential and pleiotropic roles during organismal life. While the adult bone has received significant attention, we still lack a deep understanding of the perinatal bone cellulome. Here, we have profiled the full composition of the murine endochondral bone at the single-cell level during the transition from fetal to newborn life and in comparison to the adult organ, with particular emphasis on the mesenchymal compartment. The perinatal bone contains different fibroblastic clusters with blastema-like characteristics in organizing and supporting skeletogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Our data also points out to a dynamic inter- and intra-compartment interactions as well as a bone marrow milieu prone to anti-inflammation, which we hypothesize is necessary to ensure the proper program of lymphopoiesis and the establishment of central and peripheral tolerance in early life. Our study provides a integrative roadmap for the future design of genetic and cellular functional assays to validate cellular interactions and lineage relationships within the perinatal bone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical properties are cues for many biological processes in health or disease. Likewise, in the heart it is becoming clearer that mechanical signals are critically involved in the disease progression. Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment at costameres through integrins and associated proteins, including the mechanosensitive protein talin as an integral component. Our previous work indicated different modes of talin tension, depending on the extracellular matrix stiffness. Here, we wanted to study how this leads to downstream mechanotransduction changes, further influencing the cardiomyocyte phenotype. Combining immunoprecipitations and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1, RIAM and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at specific extracellular matrix stiffness and this interaction is preserved even in absence of tension. This demonstrates a mechanical memory, which we confirm further in vivo in mouse hearts. The mechanical memory is regulated through adhesion related kinase pathways. Optogenetic experiments using the LOVTRAP systems confirm direct competition between the individual proteins, which again is altered through phosphorylation. DLC1 regulates RhoA activity in a stiffness dependent way and both loss and overexpression of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together the study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin-interactome to finetune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Replication stresses are the major source of break-induced replication (BIR). Here, we show that in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells, replication stress-induced polyubiquitinated PCNA (polyUb-PCNA) triggers BIR at telomeres and the common fragile site (CFS). Consistently, depleting RAD18, a PCNA ubiquitinating enzyme, reduces the occurrence of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres and CFS, both of which are mediated by BIR. In contrast, inhibiting USP1, an Ub-PCNA deubiquitinating enzyme, results in an increase in the above phenotypes in a RAD18- and UBC13 (the PCNA polyubiquitinating enzyme)-dependent manner. Furthermore, deficiency of ATAD5, which facilitates USP1 activity and unloads PCNAs, augments recombination-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, telomeric polyUb-PCNA accumulates SLX4, a nuclease scaffold, at telomeres through its ubiquitin-binding domain and increases telomere damage. Consistently, APB increase induced by Ub-PCNA depends on SLX4 and SLX4-associated nucleases. Taken together, our results identified the polyUb-PCNA-SLX4 axis as a trigger for directing BIR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell Painting assays generate morphological profiles that are versatile descriptors of biological systems and have been used to predict in vitro and in vivo drug effects. However, Cell Painting features are based on image statistics, and are, therefore, often not readily biologically interpretable. In this study, we introduce an approach that maps specific Cell Painting features into the BioMorph space using readouts from comprehensive Cell Health assays. We validated that the resulting BioMorph space effectively connected compounds not only with the morphological features associated with their bioactivity but with deeper insights into phenotypic characteristics and cellular processes associated with the given bioactivity. The BioMorph space revealed the mechanism of action for individual compounds, including dual-acting compounds such as emetine, an inhibitor of both protein synthesis and DNA replication. In summary, BioMorph space offers a more biologically relevant way to interpret cell morphological features from the Cell Painting assays and to generate hypotheses for experimental validation.

The resulting BioMorph space improves the ability to understand the mechanism of action and toxicity of compounds and to generate hypotheses to guide future experiments.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LICombining Cell Painting and Cell Health imaging data defines the BioMorph space.
C_LIO_LIBioMorph space allows detecting less common mechanisms for bioactive compounds.
C_LIO_LIBioMorph space can generate MOA hypotheses to guide experimental validation.
C_LIO_LIBioMorph space is more biologically relevant and interpretable than Cell Painting features.
