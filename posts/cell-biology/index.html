The C-terminal proline rich domain (PRD) of these proteins binds Sec23A and affects COPII assembly at ERES. These PRD interactions were replaced with light-responsive domains to control the binding between TANGO1S-DPRD and Sec23A. TANGO1S{Delta}PRD was dispersed in the ER membrane but relocated rapidly, yet reversibly, to pre-exiting ERES by binding to Sec23A upon light-activation. Prolonged binding of these two proteins concentrated ERES in the juxtanuclear region by a microtubule dependent process, blocked secretory cargo export and relocated ERGIC53 into the ER, but had limited impact on Golgi complex organization. Under these conditions, bulky collagen VII, and endogenous collagen I were collected at less than 47% of the stalled ERES, whereas small cargo molecules were halted uniformly across the ER, indicating that ERES differentially adapt to cargo size. We suggest these differences in cargo-accumulation at ERES permit cells to balance trafficking of cargoes of different sizes and optimize secretion.\nExtensive remodeling of the ubiquitination landscape during aging in C. elegans\nAuthors: Vilchez, D.; Koyuncu, S.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570635\nIn previous work, we investigated ubiquitination changes during aging in C. elegans. We identified 2,163 peptides undergoing age-related ubiquitination changes in wild-type animals, corresponding to 1,050 proteins. While many lysine sites had increased ubiquitination with age, a larger number exhibited decreased ubiquitination. Longevity pathways, such as reduced insulin signaling and dietary restriction, prevented ubiquitination changes. Treatment with a broad-spectrum inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) or knockdown of specific DUBs ameliorated ubiquitination loss in old worms. Moreover, we identified proteins that accumulate with aging due to reduced ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Our conclusions were supported by multiple approaches, including ubiquitin and total proteomics, western blot, and ubiquitin-less mutations. Concerns were raised by a laboratory regarding the possibility of our protocol omitting insoluble proteins due to a centrifugation step after protein extraction and solubilization. To address these concerns, we have focused on proteins previously reported to become insoluble with aging in C. elegans. Our proteomics experiments successfully detected and quantified all these proteins in old worms. In many cases, the proteins that become insoluble with aging did not change or even increased at the total levels. However, they often exhibited ubiquitination changes, primarily a loss of ubiquitination. Independent work combining analysis of conformational changes with our datasets demonstrated that 92% of the age-dependent metastable proteins exhibit differential ubiquitination during aging. In addition, we performed experiments to confirm that the buffers used for proteomics and western blot efficiently solubilize most of the proteome. Importantly, the analysis of total homogenates combining clear lysates and the remaining debris after protein extraction also revealed decreased ubiquitination during aging, whereas DUB inhibitor treatment (4 h) in old worms restored ubiquitination levels. These data further support our previous conclusions regarding extensive ubiquitination changes during aging in C. elegans.\nUniversal Cell Embeddings: A Foundation Model for Cell Biology\nAuthors: Rosen, Y.; Roohani, Y.; Agrawal, A.; Samotorcan, L.; Consortium, T. S.; Quake, S. R.; Leskovec, J.\nScore: 83.6, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568918\nDeveloping a universal representation of cells which encompasses the tremendous molecular diversity of cell types within the human body and more generally, across species, would be transformative for cell biology. Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.\nMechanical positive feedback and biochemical negative feedback combine to generate complex contractile oscillations in cytokinesis\nAuthors: Werner, M. E.; Ray, D. D.; Breen, C.; Staddon, M. F.; Jug, F.; Banerjee, S.; Maddox, A. S.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569672\nContractile force generation by the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton is essential for a multitude of biological processes. The actomyosin cortex behaves as an active material that drives local and large-scale shape changes via cytoskeletal remodeling in response to biochemical cues and feedback loops. Cytokinesis is the essential cell division event during which a cortical actomyosin ring generates contractile force to change cell shape and separate two daughter cells. Our recent work with active gel theory predicts that actomyosin systems under the control of a biochemical oscillator and experiencing mechanical strain will exhibit complex spatiotemporal behavior, but cytokinetic contractility was thought to be kinetically simple. To test whether active materials in vivo exhibit spatiotemporally complex kinetics, we used 4-dimensional imaging with unprecedented temporal resolution and discovered sections of the cytokinetic cortex undergo periodic phases of acceleration and deceleration. Quantification of ingression speed oscillations revealed wide ranges of oscillation period and amplitude. In the cytokinetic ring, activity of the master regulator RhoA pulsed with a timescale of approximately 20 seconds, shorter than that reported for any other biological context. Contractility oscillated with 20-second periodicity and with much longer periods. A combination of in vivo and in silico approaches to modify mechanical feedback revealed that the period of contractile oscillation is prolonged as a function of the intensity of mechanical feedback. Effective local ring ingression is characterized by slower speed oscillations, likely due to increased local stresses and therefore mechanical feedback. Fast ingression also occurs where material turnover is high, in vivo and in silico. We propose that downstream of initiation by pulsed RhoA activity, mechanical positive feedback, including but not limited to material advection, extends the timescale of contractility beyond that of biochemical input and therefore makes it robust to fluctuations in activation. Circumferential propagation of contractility likely allows sustained contractility despite cytoskeletal remodeling necessary to recover from compaction. Our work demonstrates that while biochemical feedback loops afford systems responsiveness and robustness, mechanical feedback must also be considered to describe and understand the behaviors of active materials in vivo.\nCytokinetic abscission requires actin-dependent microtubule severing\nAuthors: Advedissian, T.; Fremont, S.; Echard, A.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.571051\nCell division is completed by the abscission of the intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells. Abscission requires the polymerization of an ESCRT-III cone close to the midbody to both recruit the microtubule severing enzyme spastin and scission the plasma membrane. Contrary to the common assumption, we found that the microtubule and the membrane cuts are two separate events and are regulated differently. We uncovered that the F-actin disassembling protein Cofilin-1 controls the disappearance of a transient pool of branched F-actin which is precisely assembled at the tip of the ESCRT-III cone just before the microtubule cut. Functionally, Cofilin-1 and Arp2/3-mediated branched F-actin favor abscission by promoting local severing of the microtubules but do not participate later in the membrane scission event. Mechanistically, branched F-actin functions as a physical barrier that limits ESCRT-III cone elongation and thereby favors stable spastin recruitment. Our work thus reveals that F-actin unexpectedly controls the timely and local disassembly of microtubules required for cytokinetic abscission.\nThe ULK1 effector BAG2 regulates autophagy initiation by modulating AMBRA1 localization\nAuthors: Dengjel, J.; Siva Sankar, D.; Kaeser-Pebernard, S.; Vionnet, C.; Favre, S.; Oliveira De Marchioro, L.; Pillet, B.; Zhou, J.; Kovacs, W. J.; Kressler, D.; Antonioli, M.; Fimia, G. M.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570815\nCanonical autophagy is regulated by ULK1, the most proximal protein kinase specifically regulating autophagy initiation. To gain new insights into functions of the ULK1 holo-complex in autophagy regulation, we generated a deep ULK1 complex interactome by combining affinity purification- and proximity labelling-mass spectrometry of all four ULK1 complex members: ULK1, ATG13, ATG101 and RB1CC1/FIP200. Under starvation conditions, the ULK1 complex interacts with several protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases implying the formation of a signalosome. Interestingly, also several selective autophagy receptors interact with ULK1 indicating the activation of selective autophagy pathways by nutrient starvation. One effector of the ULK1 complex is the HSC/HSP70 co-chaperone BAG2, which regulates the subcellular localization of the VPS34 lipid kinase complex member AMBRA1. Depending on the nutritional status, BAG2 has opposing roles. In growth promoting conditions, the unphosphorylated form of BAG2 sequesters AMBRA1, attenuating autophagy induction. In starvation conditions, ULK1 phosphorylates BAG2 on Ser31, supporting its recruitment to the ER membrane and positively affecting autophagy flux.\nβ-H-Spectrin is a key component of an apical-medial hub of proteins during cell wedging in tube morphogenesis\nAuthors: Gillard, G.; Röper, K.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570290\nCoordinated cell shape changes are a major driver of tissue morphogenesis during development, with apical constriction or wedging of groups of epithelial cells for instance leading to tissue bending in folding or budding processes. During the budding of the tubes of the salivary glands in the Drosophila embryo we previously identified a key interplay between the apical-medial actomyosin that drives apical constriction with the underlying longitudinal microtubule array. At this microtubule-actomyosin interface a hub of proteins accumulates: in addition to the microtubule-actin crosslinker Shot and the minus-end-binder Patronin, we identified two actin-crosslinkers, {beta}-H-Spectrin and Filamin, and the multi-PDZ protein Big bang as components of this apical-medial hub. Tissue-specific degradation of {beta}-H-Spectrin led to reduction of apical-medial Big bang, F-actin, Shot and Patronin and concomittant defects in apical constriction and tube morphogenesis. Residual Patronin still present in the apical-medial position was sufficient to assist microtubule reorganisation into the longitudinal array. In contrast to Patronin and Shot, neither {beta}-H-Spectrin nor Big bang required microtubules for their localisation. {beta}-H-Spectrin instead appeared to be recruited to the apical-medial domain via binding to phosphoinositides that accumulated here. Overexpression of a {beta}-H-Spectrin fragment containing its PH domain displaced endogenous {beta}-H-Spectrin from the apical-medial domain and led to strong morphogenetic defects. The interconnected hub therefore required the synergy of membrane-associated {beta}-H-Spectrin and microtubules and their respective interactors for its assembly and function in sustaining the apical constriction during tube invagination.\nExpansion of human hematopoietic stem cells by inhibiting translation\nAuthors: Li, C.; Shin, H.; Bhavanasi, D.; Liu, M.; Yu, X.; Peslak, S. A.; Liu, X.; Alvarez--Dominguez, J. R.; Blobel, G. A.; Gregory, B. D.; Huang, J.; Klein, P. S.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568925\nHematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation using umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia and bone marrow failure but is limited by the low number of HSCs in UCB. The loss of HSCs after ex vivo manipulation is also a major obstacle to gene editing for inherited blood disorders. HSCs require a low rate of translation to maintain their capacity for self-renewal, but hematopoietic cytokines used to expand HSCs stimulate protein synthesis and impair long-term self-renewal. We previously described cytokine-free conditions that maintain but do not expand human and mouse HSCs ex vivo. Here we performed a high throughput screen and identified translation inhibitors that allow ex vivo expansion of human HSCs while minimizing cytokine exposure. Transplantation assays show a [~]5-fold expansion of long-term HSCs from UCB after one week of culture in low cytokine conditions. Single cell transcriptomic analysis demonstrates maintenance of HSCs expressing mediators of the unfolded protein stress response, further supporting the importance of regulated proteostasis in HSC maintenance and expansion. This expansion method maintains and expands human HSCs after CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the BCL11A+58 enhancer, overcoming a major obstacle to ex vivo gene correction for human hemoglobinopathies.\nEngraftment and injury repair in regionally conditioned rat lung in vivo by lung progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells.\nAuthors: Liu, H.-Y.; Predella, C.; Chen, Y.-W.; Wang, J.; Fare, S.; Pezet, M. G.; Liang, S.; Saqi, A.; Murray, J. W.; Vunjak-Novakovic, G.; Snoeck, H.-W.; Dorrello, N. V.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569060\nAlthough lung disease is a major cause of mortality, the mechanisms involved in human lung regeneration are unclear because of the lack of experimental models. Here we report a novel model where human pluripotent stem cell-derived expandable cell lines sharing features of airway secretory and basal cells engraft in the distal rat lung after conditioning by locoregional de-epithelialization followed by irradiation and immunosuppression. The engrafting cells, which we named distal lung epithelial progenitors (DLEPs), contributed to alveolar epithelial cells and generated KRT5-pods, structures involved in distal lung repair after severe injury, but only rarely to distal airways. Most strikingly, however, injury induced by the conditioning regimen was largely prevented by the engrafting DLEPs. The approach described here provides a model to study mechanisms involved in human lung regeneration, and potentially lays the foundation for the preclinical development of cell therapy to treat lung injury and disease.\nPermanent deconstruction of intracellular primary cilia in differentiating granule cell neurons\nAuthors: Ott, C. M.; Constable, S.; White, K.; Nguyen, T.; Lee, W.-C. A.; Lippincott-Schwartz, J.; Mukhopadhyay, S.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.565988\nPrimary cilia on granule cell neuron progenitors in the developing cerebellum detect sonic hedgehog to facilitate proliferation. Following differentiation, cerebellar granule cells become the most abundant neuronal cell type in the brain. While essential during early developmental stages, the fate of granule cell cilia is unknown. Here, we provide nanoscopic resolution of ciliary dynamics in situ by studying developmental changes in granule cell cilia using large-scale electron microscopy volumes and immunostaining of mouse cerebella. We found that many granule cell primary cilia were intracellular and concealed from the external environment. Cilia were disassembed in differentiating granule cell neurons in a process we call cilia deconstruction that was distinct from pre-mitotic cilia resorption in proliferating progenitors. In differentiating granule cells, ciliary loss involved unique disassembly intermediates, and, as maturation progressed, mother centriolar docking at the plasma membrane. Cilia did not reform from the docked centrioles, rather, in adult mice granule cell neurons remained unciliated. Many neurons in other brain regions require cilia to regulate function and connectivity. In contrast, our results show that granule cell progenitors had concealed cilia that underwent deconstruction potentially to prevent mitogenic hedgehog responsiveness. The ciliary deconstruction mechanism we describe could be paradigmatic of cilia removal during differentiation in other tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">TANGO1-family proteins (TANGO1, TANGO1S and cTAGE5) form stable complexes at the Endoplasmic Reticulum Exit Sites (ERES) and mediate export of bulky cargoes. The C-terminal proline rich domain (PRD) of these proteins binds Sec23A and affects COPII assembly at ERES. These PRD interactions were replaced with light-responsive domains to control the binding between TANGO1S-DPRD and Sec23A. TANGO1S{Delta}PRD was dispersed in the ER membrane but relocated rapidly, yet reversibly, to pre-exiting ERES by binding to Sec23A upon light-activation. Prolonged binding of these two proteins concentrated ERES in the juxtanuclear region by a microtubule dependent process, blocked secretory cargo export and relocated ERGIC53 into the ER, but had limited impact on Golgi complex organization. Under these conditions, bulky collagen VII, and endogenous collagen I were collected at less than 47% of the stalled ERES, whereas small cargo molecules were halted uniformly across the ER, indicating that ERES differentially adapt to cargo size. We suggest these differences in cargo-accumulation at ERES permit cells to balance trafficking of cargoes of different sizes and optimize secretion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In previous work, we investigated ubiquitination changes during aging in C. elegans. We identified 2,163 peptides undergoing age-related ubiquitination changes in wild-type animals, corresponding to 1,050 proteins. While many lysine sites had increased ubiquitination with age, a larger number exhibited decreased ubiquitination. Longevity pathways, such as reduced insulin signaling and dietary restriction, prevented ubiquitination changes. Treatment with a broad-spectrum inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) or knockdown of specific DUBs ameliorated ubiquitination loss in old worms. Moreover, we identified proteins that accumulate with aging due to reduced ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Our conclusions were supported by multiple approaches, including ubiquitin and total proteomics, western blot, and ubiquitin-less mutations. Concerns were raised by a laboratory regarding the possibility of our protocol omitting insoluble proteins due to a centrifugation step after protein extraction and solubilization. To address these concerns, we have focused on proteins previously reported to become insoluble with aging in C. elegans. Our proteomics experiments successfully detected and quantified all these proteins in old worms. In many cases, the proteins that become insoluble with aging did not change or even increased at the total levels. However, they often exhibited ubiquitination changes, primarily a loss of ubiquitination. Independent work combining analysis of conformational changes with our datasets demonstrated that 92% of the age-dependent metastable proteins exhibit differential ubiquitination during aging. In addition, we performed experiments to confirm that the buffers used for proteomics and western blot efficiently solubilize most of the proteome. Importantly, the analysis of total homogenates combining clear lysates and the remaining debris after protein extraction also revealed decreased ubiquitination during aging, whereas DUB inhibitor treatment (4 h) in old worms restored ubiquitination levels. These data further support our previous conclusions regarding extensive ubiquitination changes during aging in C. elegans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developing a universal representation of cells which encompasses the tremendous molecular diversity of cell types within the human body and more generally, across species, would be transformative for cell biology. Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Contractile force generation by the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton is essential for a multitude of biological processes. The actomyosin cortex behaves as an active material that drives local and large-scale shape changes via cytoskeletal remodeling in response to biochemical cues and feedback loops. Cytokinesis is the essential cell division event during which a cortical actomyosin ring generates contractile force to change cell shape and separate two daughter cells. Our recent work with active gel theory predicts that actomyosin systems under the control of a biochemical oscillator and experiencing mechanical strain will exhibit complex spatiotemporal behavior, but cytokinetic contractility was thought to be kinetically simple. To test whether active materials in vivo exhibit spatiotemporally complex kinetics, we used 4-dimensional imaging with unprecedented temporal resolution and discovered sections of the cytokinetic cortex undergo periodic phases of acceleration and deceleration. Quantification of ingression speed oscillations revealed wide ranges of oscillation period and amplitude. In the cytokinetic ring, activity of the master regulator RhoA pulsed with a timescale of approximately 20 seconds, shorter than that reported for any other biological context. Contractility oscillated with 20-second periodicity and with much longer periods. A combination of in vivo and in silico approaches to modify mechanical feedback revealed that the period of contractile oscillation is prolonged as a function of the intensity of mechanical feedback. Effective local ring ingression is characterized by slower speed oscillations, likely due to increased local stresses and therefore mechanical feedback. Fast ingression also occurs where material turnover is high, in vivo and in silico. We propose that downstream of initiation by pulsed RhoA activity, mechanical positive feedback, including but not limited to material advection, extends the timescale of contractility beyond that of biochemical input and therefore makes it robust to fluctuations in activation. Circumferential propagation of contractility likely allows sustained contractility despite cytoskeletal remodeling necessary to recover from compaction. Our work demonstrates that while biochemical feedback loops afford systems responsiveness and robustness, mechanical feedback must also be considered to describe and understand the behaviors of active materials in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell division is completed by the abscission of the intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells. Abscission requires the polymerization of an ESCRT-III cone close to the midbody to both recruit the microtubule severing enzyme spastin and scission the plasma membrane. Contrary to the common assumption, we found that the microtubule and the membrane cuts are two separate events and are regulated differently. We uncovered that the F-actin disassembling protein Cofilin-1 controls the disappearance of a transient pool of branched F-actin which is precisely assembled at the tip of the ESCRT-III cone just before the microtubule cut. Functionally, Cofilin-1 and Arp2/3-mediated branched F-actin favor abscission by promoting local severing of the microtubules but do not participate later in the membrane scission event. Mechanistically, branched F-actin functions as a physical barrier that limits ESCRT-III cone elongation and thereby favors stable spastin recruitment. Our work thus reveals that F-actin unexpectedly controls the timely and local disassembly of microtubules required for cytokinetic abscission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Canonical autophagy is regulated by ULK1, the most proximal protein kinase specifically regulating autophagy initiation. To gain new insights into functions of the ULK1 holo-complex in autophagy regulation, we generated a deep ULK1 complex interactome by combining affinity purification- and proximity labelling-mass spectrometry of all four ULK1 complex members: ULK1, ATG13, ATG101 and RB1CC1/FIP200. Under starvation conditions, the ULK1 complex interacts with several protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases implying the formation of a signalosome. Interestingly, also several selective autophagy receptors interact with ULK1 indicating the activation of selective autophagy pathways by nutrient starvation. One effector of the ULK1 complex is the HSC/HSP70 co-chaperone BAG2, which regulates the subcellular localization of the VPS34 lipid kinase complex member AMBRA1. Depending on the nutritional status, BAG2 has opposing roles. In growth promoting conditions, the unphosphorylated form of BAG2 sequesters AMBRA1, attenuating autophagy induction. In starvation conditions, ULK1 phosphorylates BAG2 on Ser31, supporting its recruitment to the ER membrane and positively affecting autophagy flux.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coordinated cell shape changes are a major driver of tissue morphogenesis during development, with apical constriction or wedging of groups of epithelial cells for instance leading to tissue bending in folding or budding processes. During the budding of the tubes of the salivary glands in the Drosophila embryo we previously identified a key interplay between the apical-medial actomyosin that drives apical constriction with the underlying longitudinal microtubule array. At this microtubule-actomyosin interface a hub of proteins accumulates: in addition to the microtubule-actin crosslinker Shot and the minus-end-binder Patronin, we identified two actin-crosslinkers, {beta}-H-Spectrin and Filamin, and the multi-PDZ protein Big bang as components of this apical-medial hub. Tissue-specific degradation of {beta}-H-Spectrin led to reduction of apical-medial Big bang, F-actin, Shot and Patronin and concomittant defects in apical constriction and tube morphogenesis. Residual Patronin still present in the apical-medial position was sufficient to assist microtubule reorganisation into the longitudinal array. In contrast to Patronin and Shot, neither {beta}-H-Spectrin nor Big bang required microtubules for their localisation. {beta}-H-Spectrin instead appeared to be recruited to the apical-medial domain via binding to phosphoinositides that accumulated here. Overexpression of a {beta}-H-Spectrin fragment containing its PH domain displaced endogenous {beta}-H-Spectrin from the apical-medial domain and led to strong morphogenetic defects. The interconnected hub therefore required the synergy of membrane-associated {beta}-H-Spectrin and microtubules and their respective interactors for its assembly and function in sustaining the apical constriction during tube invagination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation using umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia and bone marrow failure but is limited by the low number of HSCs in UCB. The loss of HSCs after ex vivo manipulation is also a major obstacle to gene editing for inherited blood disorders. HSCs require a low rate of translation to maintain their capacity for self-renewal, but hematopoietic cytokines used to expand HSCs stimulate protein synthesis and impair long-term self-renewal. We previously described cytokine-free conditions that maintain but do not expand human and mouse HSCs ex vivo. Here we performed a high throughput screen and identified translation inhibitors that allow ex vivo expansion of human HSCs while minimizing cytokine exposure. Transplantation assays show a [~]5-fold expansion of long-term HSCs from UCB after one week of culture in low cytokine conditions. Single cell transcriptomic analysis demonstrates maintenance of HSCs expressing mediators of the unfolded protein stress response, further supporting the importance of regulated proteostasis in HSC maintenance and expansion. This expansion method maintains and expands human HSCs after CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the BCL11A&#43;58 enhancer, overcoming a major obstacle to ex vivo gene correction for human hemoglobinopathies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although lung disease is a major cause of mortality, the mechanisms involved in human lung regeneration are unclear because of the lack of experimental models. Here we report a novel model where human pluripotent stem cell-derived expandable cell lines sharing features of airway secretory and basal cells engraft in the distal rat lung after conditioning by locoregional de-epithelialization followed by irradiation and immunosuppression. The engrafting cells, which we named distal lung epithelial progenitors (DLEPs), contributed to alveolar epithelial cells and generated  KRT5-pods, structures involved in distal lung repair after severe injury, but only rarely to distal airways. Most strikingly, however, injury induced by the conditioning regimen was largely prevented by the engrafting DLEPs. The approach described here provides a model to study mechanisms involved in human lung regeneration, and potentially lays the foundation for the preclinical development of cell therapy to treat lung injury and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primary cilia on granule cell neuron progenitors in the developing cerebellum detect sonic hedgehog to facilitate proliferation. Following differentiation, cerebellar granule cells become the most abundant neuronal cell type in the brain. While essential during early developmental stages, the fate of granule cell cilia is unknown. Here, we provide nanoscopic resolution of ciliary dynamics in situ by studying developmental changes in granule cell cilia using large-scale electron microscopy volumes and immunostaining of mouse cerebella. We found that many granule cell primary cilia were intracellular and concealed from the external environment. Cilia were disassembed in differentiating granule cell neurons in a process we call cilia deconstruction that was distinct from pre-mitotic cilia resorption in proliferating progenitors. In differentiating granule cells, ciliary loss involved unique disassembly intermediates, and, as maturation progressed, mother centriolar docking at the plasma membrane. Cilia did not reform from the docked centrioles, rather, in adult mice granule cell neurons remained unciliated. Many neurons in other brain regions require cilia to regulate function and connectivity. In contrast, our results show that granule cell progenitors had concealed cilia that underwent deconstruction potentially to prevent mitogenic hedgehog responsiveness. The ciliary deconstruction mechanism we describe could be paradigmatic of cilia removal during differentiation in other tissues.</p>
