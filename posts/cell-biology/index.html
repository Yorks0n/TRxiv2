According to the predominant model in the field, AA sufficiency drives the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface by the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, from where it coordinates the majority of cellular processes (reviewed in 2,3). Importantly, however, 15 years after its initial discovery, the teleonomy of the proposed lysosomal regulation of mTORC1, and where mTORC1 acts on its effector proteins remain enigmatic 4. Here, by using multiple pharmacological and genetic means to perturb the lysosomal AA sensing and protein recycling machineries, we describe the spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and downstream functions in mammalian cells, with lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 phosphorylating distinct substrates in response to different AA sources. Moreover, we reveal that a fraction of mTOR localizes at lysosomes due to basal lysosomal proteolysis that locally supplies new AAs, even in cells grown in the presence of extracellular nutrients, whereas cytoplasmic mTORC1 is regulated by exogenous AAs. Overall, our study substantially expands our knowledge about the topology of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, and hints at the existence of distinct, Rag- and lysosome-independent mechanisms that control its activity at other subcellular locations. Given the importance of mTORC1 signalling and AA sensing for human ageing and disease 2, our findings will likely open new directions toward the identification of function-specific mTORC1 regulators, and suggest new targets for drug discovery against conditions with dysregulated mTORC1 activity in the future.\nA DRP-like pseudoenzyme coordinates with MICOS to promote cristae architecture\nAuthors: Kumar, A.; Gok, M. O.; Nguyen, K. N.; Reese, M. L.; Wideman, J. G.; Munoz-Gomez, S. A.; Friedman, J. R.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560745\nMitochondrial cristae architecture is crucial for optimal respiratory function of the organelle. Cristae shape is maintained in part by the mitochondrial inner membrane-localized MICOS complex. While MICOS is required for normal cristae morphology, the precise mechanistic role of each of the seven human MICOS subunits, and how the complex coordinates with other cristae shaping factors, has not been fully determined. Here, we examine the MICOS complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a minimal model whose genome only encodes for four core subunits. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identify a poorly characterized inner mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with MICOS and is required to maintain cristae morphology, which we name Mmc1. We demonstrate that Mmc1 works in concert with MICOS complexes to promote normal mitochondrial morphology and respiratory function. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Mmc1 is a distant relative of the Dynamin-Related Protein (DRP) family of GTPases, which are well established to shape and remodel membranes. We find that, like DRPs, Mmc1 self-associates and forms high molecular weight assemblies. Interestingly, however, Mmc1 is a pseudoenzyme that lacks key residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis, suggesting it does not dynamically remodel membranes. These data are consistent with a model in which Mmc1 stabilizes cristae architecture by acting as a scaffold to support cristae ultrastructure on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Our study reveals a new class of proteins that evolved early in fungal phylogeny and is required for the maintenance of cristae architecture. This highlights the possibility that functionally analogous proteins work with MICOS to establish cristae morphology in metazoans.\nA Flat Protein Complex Shapes Rough ER Membrane Sheets\nAuthors: Sawyer, E. M.; Jensen, L. E.; Meehl, J. B.; Larsen, K. P.; Petito, D. A.; Hurley, J. H.; Voeltz, G. K.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.559866\nRough ER sheets are a fundamental domain of the ER and the gateway into the secretory pathway. While reticulon proteins stabilize high-curvature ER tubules, it is unclear if other proteins scaffold the flat membranes of rough ER sheets. Through a proteomics screen using ER sheet localized RNA-binding proteins as bait, we identify the Sigma-1 receptor (SigmaR1) as an ER sheet shaping factor. High-resolution live cell imaging and electron tomography assign SigmaR1 as an ER sheet-localized factor whose levels determine the amount of rough ER sheets in cells. Structure-guided mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution on giant unilamellar vesicles further support a mechanism whereby SigmaR1 oligomers use their extended arrays of amphipathic helices to bind and flatten the lumenal leaflet of ER membranes. Our results demonstrate an unexpected way for proteins to sense and propagate flat membrane sheets.\nNascent Chain Ubiquitination is Uncoupled from Degradation to Enable Protein Maturation\nAuthors: Li, X.; Mariappan, M.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561585\nA significant proportion of nascent proteins undergo polyubiquitination on ribosomes in mammalian cells, yet the fate of these proteins remains elusive. The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a mechanism that mediates the ubiquitination of nascent chains on stalled ribosomes. In this study, we find that nascent proteins ubiquitinated on stalled ribosomes by the RQC ligase LTN1 are insufficient for proteasomal degradation. Our biochemical reconstitution studies reveal that ubiquitinated nascent chains are promptly deubiquitinated in the cytosol upon release from stalled ribosomes, as they are no longer associated with LTN1 E3 ligase for continuous ubiquitination to compete with cytosolic deubiquitinases. These deubiquitinated nascent chains can mature into stable proteins. However, if they misfold and expose a degradation signal, cytosolic quality control recognizes them for re-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, our findings suggest that cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination spare foldable nascent proteins while ensuring the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins.\nThe nuclear basket regulates distribution and mobility of nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast\nAuthors: Zsok, J.; Simon, F.; Bayrak, G.; Isaki, L.; Kerff, N.; Wolstenholme, A.; Weiss, L. E.; Dultz, E.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.558499\nNuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate all traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and are among the most stable protein assemblies in cells. Intriguingly, budding yeast cells carry two variants of NPCs which differ in the presence or absence of the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39. The binding of this basket structure is the last step of NPC assembly and Mlp-positive NPCs are excluded from the region of the nuclear envelope that is associated with the nucleolus. Here, we use recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) to investigate the stability of all the NPC subcomplexes within individual NPCs. We show that the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39 remain stably associated with NPCs through multiple cell-division cycles. Mlp1/2 are responsible for the exclusion of NPCs from the nucleolar territory, but an independent pathway via Nup2 also contributes to the depletion of Mlp-negative NPCs from this region. We developed a method for single NPC tracking in budding yeast and observed that NPCs exhibit increased mobility in the absence nuclear basket components. Our data suggest that the distribution of NPCs on the nucleus is governed by the nuclear basket proteins and is the result of interactions with chromatin or chromatin-associated factors.\nCharacterising phagocytes and measuring phagocytosis from live Galleria mellonella larvae\nAuthors: Campbell, J. S.; Bebes, A.; Pradhan, A.; Yuecel, R.; Brown, A. J. P.; Wakefield, J. G.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.558207\nOver the last 20 years, the larva of the greater waxmoth, Galleria mellonella, has rapidly increased in popularity as an in vivo mammalian replacement model organism for the study of human pathogens. Despite this, experimental readouts of response to infection are generally limited to observing the melanisation cascade - where the organism turns black as part of the systemic immune response - and quantifying larval death over time. As an invertebrate, Galleria harbour an innate immune system comprised of both humoral components and a repertoire of innate immune cells - termed hemocytes. Though information on subtypes of hemocytes exist, there are conflicting reports on their exact number and function. Flow cytometry has previously been used to assay Galleria hemocytes, but protocols include both centrifugation and fixation - physical methods which have the potential to affect hemocyte morphology prior to analysis. Here, we present a method for live hemocyte analysis by flow cytometry, revealing that Galleria hemocytes constitute only a single resolvable population, based on relative size or internal complexity. Using fluorescent zymosan particles, we extend our method to show that up to 80% of the Galleria hemocyte population display phagocytic capability. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed assay reliably replicates in vitro data, showing that cell wall beta-1,3-glucan masking by Candida albicans subverts phagocytic responses. As such, our method provides a new tool with which to rapidly assess phagocytosis and understand live infection dynamics in Galleria.\nBsp1, a fungal CPI motif protein, regulates actin filament capping in endocytosis and cytokinesis\nAuthors: Hummel, D. R.; Hakala, M.; Toret, C. P.; Kaksonen, M.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561521\nThe capping of barbed filament ends is a fundamental mechanism for actin regulation. Capping protein controls filament growth and actin turnover in cells by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments with high affinity and slow off-rate. The interaction between Capping protein and actin is regulated by capping protein interaction (CPI) motif proteins. We identified a novel CPI motif protein, Bsp1, which is involved in cytokinesis and endocytosis in budding yeast. We demonstrate that Bsp1 is an actin binding protein with a high affinity for capping protein via its CPI motif. In cells, Bsp1 regulates capping protein at endocytic sites and is a major recruiter of capping protein to the cytokinetic actin ring. Lastly, we define Bsp1-related proteins as a distinct fungi-specific CPI protein group. Our results suggest that Bsp1 promotes actin filament capping by the capping protein. This study establishes Bsp1 as a new capping protein regulator and promising candidate to regulate actin networks in fungi.\nGLUD1 dictates muscle stem cell differentiation by controlling mitochondrial glutamate levels\nAuthors: Soro-Arnaiz, I.; Cherkaoui, S.; Fitzgerald, G.; Zhang, J.; Gilardoni, P.; Gosh, A.; Bar-Nur, O.; Masschelein, E.; Maechler, P.; Zamboni, N.; Poms, M.; Cremonesi, A.; Garcia-Canaveras, J.

Upon activation MuSCs metabolically rewire to meet the changing demands of proliferation. Here we describe that primary changes in metabolism itself can dictate MuSC fate decisions to control differentiation and fusion. We found that glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle decreases during MuSC differentiation and coincides with decreased expression of the mitochondrial glutamate deaminase GLUD1. Genetic deletion of Glud1 in proliferating MuSCs resulted in precocious differentiation and imbalanced fusion combined with loss of self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, deleting Glud1 caused mitochondrial glutamate accumulation in proliferating MuSCs and inhibited the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). Restoring MAS activity by supplementation of alanine normalized differentiation. In conclusion, high GLUD1 activity in proliferating MuSCs prevents deleterious mitochondrial glutamate accumulation and inactivation of the MAS. It thereby acts as a compartment specific metabolic brake on MuSC differentiation.

L.; Krauss, R. S.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561107\nAdhesion between stem cells and their niche provides stable anchorage and signaling cues to sustain properties such as quiescence. Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) directly adhere to an adjacent myofiber via cadherin-catenin complexes. Previous studies on N- and M-cadherin function in MuSCs revealed that while N-cadherin is required for quiescence, they are collectively dispensable for MuSC niche localization and regenerative activity. While additional cadherins are expressed at low levels, these findings raise the possibility that cadherins are unnecessary for MuSC anchorage to the niche. To address this question, we conditionally removed from MuSCs {beta}- and {gamma}-catenin and, separately, E- and T-catenin, factors essential for cadherin-dependent adhesion. Catenin-deficient MuSCs break quiescence similarly to N-/M-cadherin-deficient MuSCs, but exit the niche, and are depleted. A combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and single cell RNA sequencing approaches reveal that MuSC attrition occurs via a single fate: precocious differentiation, reentry to the niche, and fusion to myofibers. These findings indicate that cadherin-catenin-dependent adhesion is required for anchorage of MuSCs to their niche and preservation of the stem cell compartment. Furthermore, separable, cadherin regulated functions govern niche localization, quiescence, and stem cell maintenance in MuSCs.\nCentriole and transition zone structures in photoreceptor cilia revealed by cryo-electron tomography\nAuthors: Zhang, Z.; Moye, A. R.; He, F.; Chen, M.; Agosto, M. A.; Wensel, T. G.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560879\nPrimary cilia mediate sensory signaling in multiple organisms and cell types but have structures adapted for specific roles. Structural defects in them lead to devastating diseases known as ciliopathies in humans. Key to their functions are structures at their base: the basal body, the transition zone, the 'Y-shaped links' and the 'ciliary necklace'. We have used cryo-electron tomography with subtomogram averaging and conventional TEM to elucidate the structures associated with the basal region of the 'connecting cilia' of rod outer segments in mouse retina. The longitudinal variations in microtubule (MT) structures and the lumenal scaffold complexes connecting them have been determined, as well as membrane-associated transition zone structures: Y-shaped links connecting MT to the membrane, and ciliary beads connected to them that protrude from the cell surface and form a necklace-like structure. These results represent a clearer structural scaffold onto which molecules, identified genetics, proteomics, and superresolution fluorescence, can be placed in our emerging model of photoreceptor sensory cilia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Amino acid (AA) availability is a robust determinant of cell growth, through controlling mTORC1 activity 1. According to the predominant model in the field, AA sufficiency drives the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface by the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, from where it coordinates the majority of cellular processes (reviewed in 2,3). Importantly, however, 15 years after its initial discovery, the teleonomy of the proposed lysosomal regulation of mTORC1, and where mTORC1 acts on its effector proteins remain enigmatic 4. Here, by using multiple pharmacological and genetic means to perturb the lysosomal AA sensing and protein recycling machineries, we describe the spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and downstream functions in mammalian cells, with lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 phosphorylating distinct substrates in response to different AA sources. Moreover, we reveal that a fraction of mTOR localizes at lysosomes due to basal lysosomal proteolysis that locally supplies new AAs, even in cells grown in the presence of extracellular nutrients, whereas cytoplasmic mTORC1 is regulated by exogenous AAs. Overall, our study substantially expands our knowledge about the topology of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, and hints at the existence of distinct, Rag- and lysosome-independent mechanisms that control its activity at other subcellular locations. Given the importance of mTORC1 signalling and AA sensing for human ageing and disease 2, our findings will likely open new directions toward the identification of function-specific mTORC1 regulators, and suggest new targets for drug discovery against conditions with dysregulated mTORC1 activity in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial cristae architecture is crucial for optimal respiratory function of the organelle. Cristae shape is maintained in part by the mitochondrial inner membrane-localized MICOS complex. While MICOS is required for normal cristae morphology, the precise mechanistic role of each of the seven human MICOS subunits, and how the complex coordinates with other cristae shaping factors, has not been fully determined. Here, we examine the MICOS complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a minimal model whose genome only encodes for four core subunits. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identify a poorly characterized inner mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with MICOS and is required to maintain cristae morphology, which we name Mmc1. We demonstrate that Mmc1 works in concert with MICOS complexes to promote normal mitochondrial morphology and respiratory function. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Mmc1 is a distant relative of the Dynamin-Related Protein (DRP) family of GTPases, which are well established to shape and remodel membranes. We find that, like DRPs, Mmc1 self-associates and forms high molecular weight assemblies. Interestingly, however, Mmc1 is a pseudoenzyme that lacks key residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis, suggesting it does not dynamically remodel membranes. These data are consistent with a model in which Mmc1 stabilizes cristae architecture by acting as a scaffold to support cristae ultrastructure on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Our study reveals a new class of proteins that evolved early in fungal phylogeny and is required for the maintenance of cristae architecture. This highlights the possibility that functionally analogous proteins work with MICOS to establish cristae morphology in metazoans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rough ER sheets are a fundamental domain of the ER and the gateway into the secretory pathway. While reticulon proteins stabilize high-curvature ER tubules, it is unclear if other proteins scaffold the flat membranes of rough ER sheets. Through a proteomics screen using ER sheet localized RNA-binding proteins as bait, we identify the Sigma-1 receptor (SigmaR1) as an ER sheet shaping factor. High-resolution live cell imaging and electron tomography assign SigmaR1 as an ER sheet-localized factor whose levels determine the amount of rough ER sheets in cells. Structure-guided mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution on giant unilamellar vesicles further support a mechanism whereby SigmaR1 oligomers use their extended arrays of amphipathic helices to bind and flatten the lumenal leaflet of ER membranes. Our results demonstrate an unexpected way for proteins to sense and propagate flat membrane sheets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A significant proportion of nascent proteins undergo polyubiquitination on ribosomes in mammalian cells, yet the fate of these proteins remains elusive. The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a mechanism that mediates the ubiquitination of nascent chains on stalled ribosomes. In this study, we find that nascent proteins ubiquitinated on stalled ribosomes by the RQC ligase LTN1 are insufficient for proteasomal degradation. Our biochemical reconstitution studies reveal that ubiquitinated nascent chains are promptly deubiquitinated in the cytosol upon release from stalled ribosomes, as they are no longer associated with LTN1 E3 ligase for continuous ubiquitination to compete with cytosolic deubiquitinases. These deubiquitinated nascent chains can mature into stable proteins. However, if they misfold and expose a degradation signal, cytosolic quality control recognizes them for re-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, our findings suggest that cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination spare foldable nascent proteins while ensuring the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate all traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and are among the most stable protein assemblies in cells. Intriguingly, budding yeast cells carry two variants of NPCs which differ in the presence or absence of the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39. The binding of this basket structure is the last step of NPC assembly and Mlp-positive NPCs are excluded from the region of the nuclear envelope that is associated with the nucleolus. Here, we use recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) to investigate the stability of all the NPC subcomplexes within individual NPCs. We show that the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39 remain stably associated with NPCs through multiple cell-division cycles. Mlp1/2 are responsible for the exclusion of NPCs from the nucleolar territory, but an independent pathway via Nup2 also contributes to the depletion of Mlp-negative NPCs from this region. We developed a method for single NPC tracking in budding yeast and observed that NPCs exhibit increased mobility in the absence nuclear basket components. Our data suggest that the distribution of NPCs on the nucleus is governed by the nuclear basket proteins and is the result of interactions with chromatin or chromatin-associated factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the last 20 years, the larva of the greater waxmoth, Galleria mellonella, has rapidly increased in popularity as an in vivo mammalian replacement model organism for the study of human pathogens. Despite this, experimental readouts of response to infection are generally limited to observing the melanisation cascade - where the organism turns black as part of the systemic immune response - and quantifying larval death over time. As an invertebrate, Galleria harbour an innate immune system comprised of both humoral components and a repertoire of innate immune cells - termed hemocytes. Though information on subtypes of hemocytes exist, there are conflicting reports on their exact number and function. Flow cytometry has previously been used to assay Galleria hemocytes, but protocols include both centrifugation and fixation - physical methods which have the potential to affect hemocyte morphology prior to analysis. Here, we present a method for live hemocyte analysis by flow cytometry, revealing that Galleria hemocytes constitute only a single resolvable population, based on relative size or internal complexity. Using fluorescent zymosan particles, we extend our method to show that up to 80% of the Galleria hemocyte population display phagocytic capability. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed assay reliably replicates in vitro data, showing that cell wall beta-1,3-glucan masking by Candida albicans subverts phagocytic responses. As such, our method provides a new tool with which to rapidly assess phagocytosis and understand live infection dynamics in Galleria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The capping of barbed filament ends is a fundamental mechanism for actin regulation. Capping protein controls filament growth and actin turnover in cells by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments with high affinity and slow off-rate. The interaction between Capping protein and actin is regulated by capping protein interaction (CPI) motif proteins. We identified a novel CPI motif protein, Bsp1, which is involved in cytokinesis and endocytosis in budding yeast. We demonstrate that Bsp1 is an actin binding protein with a high affinity for capping protein via its CPI motif. In cells, Bsp1 regulates capping protein at endocytic sites and is a major recruiter of capping protein to the cytokinetic actin ring. Lastly, we define Bsp1-related proteins as a distinct fungi-specific CPI protein group. Our results suggest that Bsp1 promotes actin filament capping by the capping protein. This study establishes Bsp1 as a new capping protein regulator and promising candidate to regulate actin networks in fungi.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) enable muscle growth and regeneration after exercise or injury. Upon activation MuSCs metabolically rewire to meet the changing demands of proliferation. Here we describe that primary changes in metabolism itself can dictate MuSC fate decisions to control differentiation and fusion. We found that glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle decreases during MuSC differentiation and coincides with decreased expression of the mitochondrial glutamate deaminase GLUD1. Genetic deletion of Glud1 in proliferating MuSCs resulted in precocious differentiation and imbalanced fusion combined with loss of self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, deleting Glud1 caused mitochondrial glutamate accumulation in proliferating MuSCs and inhibited the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). Restoring MAS activity by supplementation of alanine normalized differentiation. In conclusion, high GLUD1 activity in proliferating MuSCs prevents deleterious mitochondrial glutamate accumulation and inactivation of the MAS. It thereby acts as a compartment specific metabolic brake on MuSC differentiation.

        <p class="abstract">Adhesion between stem cells and their niche provides stable anchorage and signaling cues to sustain properties such as quiescence. Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) directly adhere to an adjacent myofiber via cadherin-catenin complexes. Previous studies on N- and M-cadherin function in MuSCs revealed that while N-cadherin is required for quiescence, they are collectively dispensable for MuSC niche localization and regenerative activity. While additional cadherins are expressed at low levels, these findings raise the possibility that cadherins are unnecessary for MuSC anchorage to the niche. To address this question, we conditionally removed from MuSCs {beta}- and {gamma}-catenin and, separately, E- and T-catenin, factors essential for cadherin-dependent adhesion. Catenin-deficient MuSCs break quiescence similarly to N-/M-cadherin-deficient MuSCs, but exit the niche, and are depleted. A combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and single cell RNA sequencing approaches reveal that MuSC attrition occurs via a single fate: precocious differentiation, reentry to the niche, and fusion to myofibers. These findings indicate that cadherin-catenin-dependent adhesion is required for anchorage of MuSCs to their niche and preservation of the stem cell compartment. Furthermore, separable, cadherin regulated functions govern niche localization, quiescence, and stem cell maintenance in MuSCs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primary cilia mediate sensory signaling in multiple organisms and cell types but have structures adapted for specific roles. Structural defects in them lead to devastating diseases known as ciliopathies in humans. Key to their functions are structures at their base: the basal body, the transition zone, the &#39;Y-shaped links&#39; and the &#39;ciliary necklace&#39;. We have used cryo-electron tomography with subtomogram averaging and conventional TEM to elucidate the structures associated with the basal region of the &#39;connecting cilia&#39; of rod outer segments in mouse retina. The longitudinal variations in microtubule (MT) structures and the lumenal scaffold complexes connecting them have been determined, as well as membrane-associated transition zone structures: Y-shaped links connecting MT to the membrane, and ciliary beads connected to them that protrude from the cell surface and form a necklace-like structure. These results represent a clearer structural scaffold onto which molecules, identified genetics, proteomics, and superresolution fluorescence, can be placed in our emerging model of photoreceptor sensory cilia.</p>
