Phosphoinositides are a small family of phospholipids, acting as signalling hubs and key regulators of cellular function. Detecting their subcellular distribution is crucial to gain insights into membrane organisation and is most commonly done by over-expression of biosensors.

H.\nScore: 50.7, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562882\nPhosphoinositides are a small family of phospholipids, acting as signalling hubs and key regulators of cellular function. Detecting their subcellular distribution is crucial to gain insights into membrane organisation and is most commonly done by over-expression of biosensors. However, this leads to perturbations of phosphoinositide signalling and is challenging in systems that cannot be transfected. Here, we present a toolkit for the reliable, fast, multiplex, and super-resolution detection of all 8 phosphoinositides using a unifying staining approach for fixed cells and tissue, based on recombinant biosensors with self-labelling SNAP tags. These recombinant biosensors are highly specific, and reliably visualise the subcellular distributions of phosphoinositides across scales, ranging from 2D or 3D cell culture to Drosophila tissue. Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we reveal the nanoscale organisation of PI(3)P on endosomes and PI(4)P on the Golgi and confirm the preservation of subcellular membranes. Multiplex staining enables the investigation of phosphoinositide conversions and reveals an unexpected presence of residual PI(3,5)P2 positive membranes in swollen lysosomes following PIKfyve inhibition. This approach enables the versatile, high-resolution visualisation of multiple phosphoinositide species in an unprecedented manner.\nFailed reprogramming of transformed cells due to induction of apoptosis and senescence impairs tumor progression in lung cancer\nAuthors: Pedrosa, P.; Zang, Z.; Macias, D.; Ge, J.; Denholm, M.; Dyas, A.; Nunez-Quintela, V.; Estevez-Souto, V.; Lado-Fernandez, P.; Gonzalez, P.; Gomez, M.; Martin, J. E.; Da Silva-Alvarez, S.; Munoz-Espin, D.; Collado, M.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563086\nCell reprogramming to pluripotency applied to the study of cancer has identified transformation and pluripotency as two independent and incompatible cell fates. A detailed knowledge of the relationship between transformation and reprogramming could lead to the identification of new vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we explore this interplay and find that OSKM expression limits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and senescence. We identify Oct4 and Klf4 as the main individual reprogramming factors responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, the induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21 downstream of the reprogramming factors acts as mediator of cell death and senescence. Using a variety of in vivo systems, including allografts, orthotopic transplantation and KRAS-driven lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that OSKM expression impairs tumor growth and reduces tumor burden.\nCENP-E initiates chromosome congression by opposing Aurora kinases to promote end-on microtubule attachments close to centrosomes\nAuthors: Vukusic, K.; Tolic, I. M.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563150\nChromosome congression to the spindle equator, which recurrently fails in cancer cells leading to aneuploidy, requires the kinetochore motor protein CENP-E/kinesin-7. Current models state that chromosomes congress by CENP-E-driven gliding along spindle microtubules. Here, we show that CENP-E is not essential for the congression movement, but for initiating movement through the formation of end-on attachments. We reached this conclusion by large-scale live-cell imaging under varying activity of CENP-E using lattice light-sheet microscopy. We found that congression without CENP-E is delayed by the activity of centriole-dependent Aurora A and outer-kinetochore-localized Aurora B kinases, which limit the formation of end-on attachments. CENP-E bypasses this inhibition by causing a decrease in Aurora B activity and in phosphorylation of its outer-kinetochore targets. Chromosomally unstable cancer cells rely on CENP-E more than non-cancer cells, leading to segregation errors specifically in cancer cells with prolonged mitosis, thereby exposing a mitotic timing-dependent vulnerability of cancer cells.\nEvaluation of the neutralising antibody response in human and hamster sera against SARS-CoV-2 variants up to and including BA.2.86 using an authentic virus neutralisation assay\nAuthors: Coombes, N.

P.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563398\nNew vaccines, therapeutics and immunity elicited by natural infection create evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and adapt to evade vaccine-induced and infection-elicited immunity. Vaccine and therapeutics developers thus find themselves in an \"arms race\" with the virus. The ongoing assessment of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants remains essential as the global community transitions from an emergency response to a long-term management plan. Here, we describe how an authentic virus neutralisation assay using low passage clinical virus isolates has been employed to monitor resistance of emerging virus variants to neutralising antibodies from humans and experimentally infected hamsters. Sera and plasma from people who received three doses of a vaccine as well as those who received a bivalent booster were assessed against SARS-CoV-2 variants, up to and including BA.2.86. Contemporary or recent virus variants showed substantial resistance to neutralisation by antibodies from those who had received three vaccines but were still effectively neutralised by antibodies from individuals who had received a bivalent booster (ancestral/BA.1). Convalescent sera from hamsters that had been experimentally infected with one of seven virus variants (ancestral, BA.1, BA.4, BA.5.2.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3) were also tested here. The most contemporary variant, BA.2.86, was effectively neutralised by sera from hamsters infected with XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 but it was not neutralised by sera from those infected with BA.5.2.1. These data support the recommendations given by the WHO that a new vaccine was required and should consist of an XBB sub-lineage antigen.\nPrecise immunofluorescence canceling for highly multiplexed imaging capturing specific cell state\nAuthors: Tomimatsu, K.; Fujii, T.; Bise, R.; Hosoda, K.; Taniguchi, Y.; Ochiai, H.; Ohishi, H.; Ando, K.; Minami, R.; Taro, T.; Tanaka, K.; Mori, S.; Harada, A.; Maehara, K.; Nagasaki, M.; Uchida, S.; Kimura, H.; Narita, M.; Ohkawa, Y.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.561810\nCell states are regulated by the response of signaling pathways to receptor ligand-binding and inter-cellular interactions. High-resolution imaging has been attempted to explore the dynamics of these processes and, recently, multiplexed imaging has profiled cell states by achieving a comprehensive acquisition of spatial protein information from cells. However, the specificity of antibodies is still compromised when visualizing activated signals. Here, we developed Precise Emission Canceling Antibodies (PECAbs) that have cleavable fluorescent labeling. PECAbs enable high-specificity sequential imaging using hundreds of antibodies, allowing for reconstruction of the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling pathways. Additionally, combining this approach with seq-smFISH can effectively classify cells and identify their signal activation states in human tissue. Overall, the PECAb system can serve as a comprehensive platform for analyzing complex cell processes.\nT cells Use Focal Adhesions to Pull Themselves Through Confined Environments\nAuthors: Caillier, A.; Oleksyn, D.; Fowell, D. J.; Miller, J.; Oakes, P. W.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562587\nImmune cells are highly dynamic and able to migrate through environments with diverse biochemical and mechanical composition. Their migration has classically been defined as amoeboid under the assumption that it is integrin-independent. Here we show that activated primary Th1 T cells require both confinement and extracellular matrix protein to migrate efficiently. This migration is mediated through small and dynamic focal adhesions that are composed of the same proteins associated with canonical mesenchymal focal adhesions, such as integrins, talin, and vinculin. These focal adhesions, furthermore, localize to sites of contractile traction stresses, enabling T cells to pull themselves through confined spaces. Finally, we show that Th1 T cell preferentially follows tracks of other T cells, suggesting that these adhesions are modifying the extracellular matrix to provide additional environmental guidance cues. These results demonstrate not only that the boundaries between amoeboid and mesenchymal migration modes are ambiguous, but that integrin-mediated adhesions play a key role in T cell motility.

K.; Rosas Salvans, M. K.; Tran, V.; Dumont, S.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562637\nAccurate chromosome segregation requires sister kinetochores to biorient, attaching to opposite spindle poles. To this end, the mammalian kinetochore destabilizes incorrect attachments and stabilizes correct ones, but how it discriminates between these is not yet clear. Here, we test the model that kinetochore tension is the stabilizing cue and ask how chromosome size impacts that model. We live image PtK2 cells, with just 14 chromosomes, widely ranging in size, and find that long chromosomes align at the metaphase plate later than short chromosomes. Enriching for errors and imaging error correction live, we show that long chromosomes exhibit a specific delay in correcting attachments. Using chromokinesin overexpression and laser ablation to perturb polar ejection forces, we find that chromosome size and force on arms determine alignment order. Thus, we propose a model where increased force on long chromosomes can falsely stabilize incorrect attachments, delaying their biorientation. As such, long chromosomes may require compensatory mechanisms for correcting errors to avoid chromosomal instability.\nPsychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology\nAuthors: Trumpff, C.; Monzel, A.; Sandi, C.; Menon, V.; Klein, H.-U.; Fujita, M.; Lee, A. J.; Petyuk, V. A.; Hurst, C.; Duong, D. A.; Seyfried, N.; Wingo, A.; Wingo, T. S.; Wang, Y.; Thambisetty, M.; Ferrucci, L.; Bennett, D. A.; De Jager, P.; Picard, M.\nScore: 49.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.559575\nPsychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies heavily on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and two main lines of evidence bi-directionally link mitochondria as both targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and possibly mood states alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; and on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. However, knowledge on whether positive or negative psychosocial exposures and experiences are linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain is currently unknown. By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we found that positive experiences (e.g. higher well-being) are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas negative experiences (e.g. higher negative mood) are linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, psychosocial factors explained 18% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. To increase the sensitivity of our approach, we next interrogated mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing. These results revealed strong cell type specific associations, particularly between positive psychosocial experiences and molecular mitochondrial phenotypes in glial cells, whereas neurons tended to show opposite associations. Accordingly, in bulk transcriptomic analyses where all cells are pooled, these RNA-based associations were masked. Thus, our results highlight the likely underestimation of effect sizes in bulk brain tissues, and document novel cell type specific mitochondrial psychobiological associations in the human brain. Cell type specific mitochondrial recalibrations represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking positive and negative psychosocial experiences to human brain biology. Significance statementPsychosocial experiences predict health trajectories, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We found that positive psychosocial experiences are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial energy transformation machinery, whereas negative experiences are linked to lower abundance. Overall, we found that psychosocial experiences explain 18% of the variance in abundance of complex I proteins, the main entry point of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system. At single-cell resolution using single nucleus transcriptomics, positive psychosocial experiences were particularly related to glial cell mitochondrial phenotypes. Opposite associations between glial cells and neurons were naturally masked in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Our results suggest that mitochondrial recalibrations in specific brain cell types may represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking psychosocial experiences to human brain health.\nVaccination by single dose sporozoite injection of blood stage attenuated malaria parasites\nAuthors: Sattler, J. M.; Keiber, L.; Abdelrahim, A.; Zheng, X.; Jaecklin, M.; Zechel, L.; Moreau, C. A.; Fischer, M. M.; Janse, C. J.; Hoffmann, A.; Hentzschel, F.; Frischknecht, F.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563045\nAn efficient malaria vaccine remains elusive. As an alternative to malaria subunit vaccines, vaccination approaches are currently explored using live Plasmodium parasites, either attenuated mosquito-derived sporozoites or attenuated blood stage parasites. Both approaches would profit from the availability of attenuated and avirulent parasites with a reduced blood stage multiplication rate. Ideally, such slow growing parasites would proceed normally through the mosquito but cause a self-limiting infection upon transmission. Here we screened gene-deletion mutants of the rodent parasite P. berghei and the human parasite P. falciparum for slow growth. In addition, we tested the P. berghei mutants for avirulence in mice and self-resolving blood stage infections, while preserving sporozoite formation and liver infection. Targeting fifty genes yielded seventeen P. berghei gene-deletion mutants with two mutants causing self-clearing infections in mice while retaining full transmissibility through mosquitoes. For those, infection of mice by a low number of blood stages, infected-mosquito bites or by single injection of sporozoites led to protection from disease after challenge with wild type sporozoites. Two of six generated P. falciparum gene-deletion mutants showed a slow growth rate. Slow growing, avirulent P. falciparum mutants will constitute valuable tools to inform on the induction of immune responses and aid in developing new as well as safeguarding existing attenuated parasite vaccines.\nSenPred: A single-cell RNA sequencing-based machine learning pipeline to classify senescent cells for the detection of an in vivo senescent cell burden\nAuthors: Hughes, B.; Davis, A.; Milligan, D.; Wallis, R.; Philpott, M. P.; Wainwright, L. J.; Gunn, D. A.; Bishop, C. L.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563515\nSenescence classification is an acknowledged challenge within the field, as markers are cell-type and context dependent. Currently, multiple morphological and immunofluorescence markers are required for senescent cell identification. However, emerging scRNA-seq datasets have enabled increased understanding of the heterogeneity of senescence. Here we present SenPred, a machine-learning pipeline which can identify senescence based on single-cell transcriptomics. Using scRNA-seq of both 2D and 3D deeply senescent fibroblasts, the model predicts intra-experimental and inter-experimental fibroblast senescence to a high degree of accuracy (\u003e99% true positives). We position this as a proof-of-concept study, with the goal of building a holistic model to detect multiple senescent subtypes. Importantly, utilising scRNA-seq datasets from deeply senescent fibroblasts grown in 3D refines our ML model leading to improved detection of senescent cells in vivo. This has allowed for detection of an in vivo senescent cell burden, which could have broader implications for the treatment of age-related morbidities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Phosphoinositides are a small family of phospholipids, acting as signalling hubs and key regulators of cellular function. Detecting their subcellular distribution is crucial to gain insights into membrane organisation and is most commonly done by over-expression of biosensors. However, this leads to perturbations of phosphoinositide signalling and is challenging in systems that cannot be transfected. Here, we present a toolkit for the reliable, fast, multiplex, and super-resolution detection of all 8 phosphoinositides using a unifying staining approach for fixed cells and tissue, based on recombinant biosensors with self-labelling SNAP tags. These recombinant biosensors are highly specific, and reliably visualise the subcellular distributions of phosphoinositides across scales, ranging from 2D or 3D cell culture to Drosophila tissue. Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we reveal the nanoscale organisation of PI(3)P on endosomes and PI(4)P on the Golgi and confirm the preservation of subcellular membranes. Multiplex staining enables the investigation of phosphoinositide conversions and reveals an unexpected presence of residual PI(3,5)P2 positive membranes in swollen lysosomes following PIKfyve inhibition. This approach enables the versatile, high-resolution visualisation of multiple phosphoinositide species in an unprecedented manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell reprogramming to pluripotency applied to the study of cancer has identified transformation and pluripotency as two independent and incompatible cell fates. A detailed knowledge of the relationship between transformation and reprogramming could lead to the identification of new vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we explore this interplay and find that OSKM expression limits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and senescence. We identify Oct4 and Klf4 as the main individual reprogramming factors responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, the induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21 downstream of the reprogramming factors acts as mediator of cell death and senescence. Using a variety of in vivo systems, including allografts, orthotopic transplantation and KRAS-driven lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that OSKM expression impairs tumor growth and reduces tumor burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromosome congression to the spindle equator, which recurrently fails in cancer cells leading to aneuploidy, requires the kinetochore motor protein CENP-E/kinesin-7. Current models state that chromosomes congress by CENP-E-driven gliding along spindle microtubules. Here, we show that CENP-E is not essential for the congression movement, but for initiating movement through the formation of end-on attachments. We reached this conclusion by large-scale live-cell imaging under varying activity of CENP-E using lattice light-sheet microscopy. We found that congression without CENP-E is delayed by the activity of centriole-dependent Aurora A and outer-kinetochore-localized Aurora B kinases, which limit the formation of end-on attachments. CENP-E bypasses this inhibition by causing a decrease in Aurora B activity and in phosphorylation of its outer-kinetochore targets. Chromosomally unstable cancer cells rely on CENP-E more than non-cancer cells, leading to segregation errors specifically in cancer cells with prolonged mitosis, thereby exposing a mitotic timing-dependent vulnerability of cancer cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">New vaccines, therapeutics and immunity elicited by natural infection create evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and adapt to evade vaccine-induced and infection-elicited immunity. Vaccine and therapeutics developers thus find themselves in an &#34;arms race&#34; with the virus. The ongoing assessment of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants remains essential as the global community transitions from an emergency response to a long-term management plan. Here, we describe how an authentic virus neutralisation assay using low passage clinical virus isolates has been employed to monitor resistance of emerging virus variants to neutralising antibodies from humans and experimentally infected hamsters. Sera and plasma from people who received three doses of a vaccine as well as those who received a bivalent booster were assessed against SARS-CoV-2 variants, up to and including BA.2.86. Contemporary or recent virus variants showed substantial resistance to neutralisation by antibodies from those who had received three vaccines but were still effectively neutralised by antibodies from individuals who had received a bivalent booster (ancestral/BA.1). Convalescent sera from hamsters that had been experimentally infected with one of seven virus variants (ancestral, BA.1, BA.4, BA.5.2.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3) were also tested here. The most contemporary variant, BA.2.86, was effectively neutralised by sera from hamsters infected with XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 but it was not neutralised by sera from those infected with BA.5.2.1. These data support the recommendations given by the WHO that a new vaccine was required and should consist of an XBB sub-lineage antigen.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell states are regulated by the response of signaling pathways to receptor ligand-binding and inter-cellular interactions. High-resolution imaging has been attempted to explore the dynamics of these processes and, recently, multiplexed imaging has profiled cell states by achieving a comprehensive acquisition of spatial protein information from cells. However, the specificity of antibodies is still compromised when visualizing activated signals. Here, we developed Precise Emission Canceling Antibodies (PECAbs) that have cleavable fluorescent labeling. PECAbs enable high-specificity sequential imaging using hundreds of antibodies, allowing for reconstruction of the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling pathways. Additionally, combining this approach with seq-smFISH can effectively classify cells and identify their signal activation states in human tissue. Overall, the PECAb system can serve as a comprehensive platform for analyzing complex cell processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune cells are highly dynamic and able to migrate through environments with diverse biochemical and mechanical composition. Their migration has classically been defined as amoeboid under the assumption that it is integrin-independent. Here we show that activated primary Th1 T cells require both confinement and extracellular matrix protein to migrate efficiently. This migration is mediated through small and dynamic focal adhesions that are composed of the same proteins associated with canonical mesenchymal focal adhesions, such as integrins, talin, and vinculin. These focal adhesions, furthermore, localize to sites of contractile traction stresses, enabling T cells to pull themselves through confined spaces. Finally, we show that Th1 T cell preferentially follows tracks of other T cells, suggesting that these adhesions are modifying the extracellular matrix to provide additional environmental guidance cues. These results demonstrate not only that the boundaries between amoeboid and mesenchymal migration modes are ambiguous, but that integrin-mediated adhesions play a key role in T cell motility.

        <p class="abstract">Accurate chromosome segregation requires sister kinetochores to biorient, attaching to opposite spindle poles. To this end, the mammalian kinetochore destabilizes incorrect attachments and stabilizes correct ones, but how it discriminates between these is not yet clear. Here, we test the model that kinetochore tension is the stabilizing cue and ask how chromosome size impacts that model. We live image PtK2 cells, with just 14 chromosomes, widely ranging in size, and find that long chromosomes align at the metaphase plate later than short chromosomes. Enriching for errors and imaging error correction live, we show that long chromosomes exhibit a specific delay in correcting attachments. Using chromokinesin overexpression and laser ablation to perturb polar ejection forces, we find that chromosome size and force on arms determine alignment order. Thus, we propose a model where increased force on long chromosomes can falsely stabilize incorrect attachments, delaying their biorientation. As such, long chromosomes may require compensatory mechanisms for correcting errors to avoid chromosomal instability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies heavily on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and two main lines of evidence bi-directionally link mitochondria as both targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and possibly mood states alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; and on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. However, knowledge on whether positive or negative psychosocial exposures and experiences are linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain is currently unknown. By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we found that positive experiences (e.g. higher well-being) are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas negative experiences (e.g. higher negative mood) are linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, psychosocial factors explained 18% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. To increase the sensitivity of our approach, we next interrogated mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing. These results revealed strong cell type specific associations, particularly between positive psychosocial experiences and molecular mitochondrial phenotypes in glial cells, whereas neurons tended to show opposite associations. Accordingly, in bulk transcriptomic analyses where all cells are pooled, these RNA-based associations were masked. Thus, our results highlight the likely underestimation of effect sizes in bulk brain tissues, and document novel cell type specific mitochondrial psychobiological associations in the human brain. Cell type specific mitochondrial recalibrations represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking positive and negative psychosocial experiences to human brain biology.

Significance statementPsychosocial experiences predict health trajectories, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We found that positive psychosocial experiences are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial energy transformation machinery, whereas negative experiences are linked to lower abundance. Overall, we found that psychosocial experiences explain 18% of the variance in abundance of complex I proteins, the main entry point of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system. At single-cell resolution using single nucleus transcriptomics, positive psychosocial experiences were particularly related to glial cell mitochondrial phenotypes. Opposite associations between glial cells and neurons were naturally masked in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Our results suggest that mitochondrial recalibrations in specific brain cell types may represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking psychosocial experiences to human brain health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An efficient malaria vaccine remains elusive. As an alternative to malaria subunit vaccines, vaccination approaches are currently explored using live Plasmodium parasites, either attenuated mosquito-derived sporozoites or attenuated blood stage parasites. Both approaches would profit from the availability of attenuated and avirulent parasites with a reduced blood stage multiplication rate. Ideally, such slow growing parasites would proceed normally through the mosquito but cause a self-limiting infection upon transmission. Here we screened gene-deletion mutants of the rodent parasite P. berghei and the human parasite P. falciparum for slow growth. In addition, we tested the P. berghei mutants for avirulence in mice and self-resolving blood stage infections, while preserving sporozoite formation and liver infection. Targeting fifty genes yielded seventeen P. berghei gene-deletion mutants with two mutants causing self-clearing infections in mice while retaining full transmissibility through mosquitoes. For those, infection of mice by a low number of blood stages, infected-mosquito bites or by single injection of sporozoites led to protection from disease after challenge with wild type sporozoites. Two of six generated P. falciparum gene-deletion mutants showed a slow growth rate. Slow growing, avirulent P. falciparum mutants will constitute valuable tools to inform on the induction of immune responses and aid in developing new as well as safeguarding existing attenuated parasite vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Senescence classification is an acknowledged challenge within the field, as markers are cell-type and context dependent. Currently, multiple morphological and immunofluorescence markers are required for senescent cell identification. However, emerging scRNA-seq datasets have enabled increased understanding of the heterogeneity of senescence. Here we present SenPred, a machine-learning pipeline which can identify senescence based on single-cell transcriptomics. Using scRNA-seq of both 2D and 3D deeply senescent fibroblasts, the model predicts intra-experimental and inter-experimental fibroblast senescence to a high degree of accuracy (&gt;99% true positives). We position this as a proof-of-concept study, with the goal of building a holistic model to detect multiple senescent subtypes. Importantly, utilising scRNA-seq datasets from deeply senescent fibroblasts grown in 3D refines our ML model leading to improved detection of senescent cells in vivo. This has allowed for detection of an in vivo senescent cell burden, which could have broader implications for the treatment of age-related morbidities.</p>
