T.; Lepper, C.; Millay, D.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554609\nMultinucleated skeletal muscle cells have an obligatory need to acquire additional nuclei through fusion with activated skeletal muscle stem cells when responding to both developmental and adaptive growth stimuli. A fundamental question in skeletal muscle biology has been the reason underlying this need for new nuclei in syncytial cells that already harbor hundreds of nuclei. To begin to answer this long-standing question, we utilized nuclear RNA-sequencing approaches and developed a lineage tracing strategy capable of defining the transcriptional state of recently fused nuclei and distinguishing this state from that of pre-existing nuclei. Our findings reveal the presence of conserved markers of newly fused nuclei both during development and after a hypertrophic stimulus in the adult. However, newly fused nuclei also exhibit divergent gene expression that is determined by the myogenic environment to which they fuse. Moreover, accrual of new nuclei through fusion is required for nuclei already resident in adult myofibers to mount a normal transcriptional response to a load-inducing stimulus. We propose a model of mutual regulation in the control of skeletal muscle development and adaptations, where newly fused and pre-existing myonuclear populations influence each other to maintain optimal functional growth.\nTau fibrils induce nanoscale membrane damage and nucleate cytosolic tau at lysosomes\nAuthors: Rose, K.; Jepson, T.; Shukla, S.; Maya-Romero, A.; Kampmann, M.; Xu, K.; Hurley, J. H.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555157\nThe prion-like spread of protein aggregates is a leading hypothesis for the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in the brain, including the spread of tau inclusions associated with Alzheimers disease. The mechanisms of cellular uptake of tau seeds and subsequent nucleated polymerization of cytosolic tau are major questions in the field, and the potential for coupling between the entry and nucleation mechanisms has been little explored. We found that in primary astrocytes, endocytosis of tau seeds leads to their accumulation in lysosomes. This in turn leads to lysosomal swelling, deacidification and recruitment of ESCRT proteins, but not Galectin-3, to the lysosomal membrane. These observations are consistent with nanoscale damage of the lysosomal membrane. Using live cell and STORM, imaging, nucleation of cytosolic tau occurs primarily at the lysosome membrane under these conditions. These data suggest that tau seeds escape from lysosomes via nanoscale damage rather than wholesale rupture, and that nucleation of cytosolic tau commences as soon as tau fibril ends emerge from the lysosomal membrane.\nNew structural features of the APC/C revealed by high resolution cryo-EM structures of apo-APC/C and the APC/C CDH1:EMI1 complex\nAuthors: Hoefler, A.; Yu, J.; Yang, J.; Zhang, Z.; Chang, L.; Grime, G. W.; Garman, E. F.; Boland, A.; Barford, D.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555674\nThe multi-subunit anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a master regulator of cell division. It controls progression through the cell cycle by timely marking mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The APC/C itself is regulated by the sequential action of its coactivator subunits CDC20 and CDH1, post-translational modifications, and its inhibitory binding partners EMI1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In this study, we took advantage of the latest developments in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human APC/C CDH1:EMI1 and apo-APC/C at 2.9 Angstrom and 3.2 Angstrom, respectively, providing novel insights into the regulation of APC/C activity. The high resolution maps allowed the unambigious assignment of a previously unassigned -helix to the N-terminus of CDH1 (CDH1 alpha1) in the APC/C CDH1:EMI1 ternary complex. CDH1 alpha1 binds at the APC1:APC8 interface, thereby interacting with a loop segment of APC1 through electrostatic interactions only provided by CDH1 but not CDC20. We also identified a novel zinc-binding module in APC2, and confirmed the presence of zinc ions experimentally. Finally, due to the higher resolution and well defined density of these maps we were able to build, aided by AlphaFold predictions, several intrinsically disordered regions in different APC/C subunits that play a fundamental role in proper complex assembly.\nGlycolytic Metabolon Assembly on Mitochondria via Hexokinase O-GlcNAcylation Promotes Metabolic Efficiency\nAuthors: Wang, H.; Vant, J.; Wu, Y.; Sanchez, R.; Micou, M. L.; Zhang, A.; Luczak, V.; Yu, S. B.; Jabbo, M.; Yoon, S.; Abushawish, A. A.; Ghassemian, M.; Griffis, E.; Hammarlund, M.; Singharoy, A.; Pekkurnaz, G.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554955\nGlucose is the primary cellular energy substrate and its metabolism via glycolysis is initiated by the rate-limiting enzyme Hexokinase (HK). In energy-demanding tissues like the brain, HK1 is the prominent isoform, primarily localized on mitochondria, crucial for the efficient coupling of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby ensuring optimal energy generation. Here, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism whereby metabolic sensor enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modulates HK1 activity and its mitochondrial association. OGT catalyzes reversible O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification, influenced by glucose flux-mediated intracellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of HK1s regulatory domain occurs with increased OGT activity, promoting glycolytic metabolon assembly on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This modification enhances HK1s mitochondrial localization, orchestrating glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production. Mutations in HK1s O-GlcNAcylation site reduce ATP generation, affecting presynaptic vesicle release in neurons. Our findings reveal a new pathway linking neuronal metabolism to mitochondrial function through OGT and glycolytic metabolon formation, and provide important insight into the previously unknown metabolism plasticity mechanism.\nSpatiotemporal control of microtubule acetylation by mechanical cues regulates lysosome dynamics at the immune synapse of B cells to promote antigen presentation\nAuthors: Del Valle Batalla, F.; Riobo Cavada, I.; Hernandez-Perez, S.; Mattila, P. K.; Yuseff, M.-I.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555091\nThe capacity of B cells to extract immobilized antigens through the formation of an immune synapse can be tuned by the physical characteristics of the surface where antigens are encountered. However, the underlying mechanisms that couple mechanosensing by B cells to antigen extraction and processing remain poorly understood. We show that B cells activated by antigens associated with stiffer substrates exhibit enhanced spreading responses and higher tubulin acetylation at the center of the immune synapse, where less motile lysosomes preferentially localize. This process is coupled to the translocation of the microtubule acetylase, ATAT1 to the cytoplasm of B cells, which occurs as a mechano-response during BCR stimulation. Accordingly, B cells silenced for ATAT1 are unable to stabilize lysosomes at the synaptic interface and display a lower capacity to extract and present immobilized antigens to T cells. Overall, these findings highlight how BCR-dependent mechano-responses trigger microtubule network modifications to precisely orchestrate lysosome positioning to promote antigen extraction and presentation in B cells.\nA RAB7A Phosphoswitch Coordinates Rubicon Homology Protein Regulation of PINK1/Parkin-Dependent Mitophagy\nAuthors: Tudorica, D. A.; Basak, B. L. F.; Cordova, A. P.; Khuu, G.; Rose, K.; Lazarou, M.; Holzbaur, E.; Hurley, J. H.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555228\nActivation of PINK1 and Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage initiates a cytoprotective mitophagy response that includes phosphorylation of RAB7A at Ser72. Rubicon is a RAB7A binding protein that acts as a negative regulator of autophagy. The structure of the Rubicon-RAB7A complex suggests that phosphorylation of RAB7A at Ser72 would block Rubicon binding. Indeed, in vitro phosphorylation of RAB7A by TBK1 abrogates Rubicon-RAB7A binding. Pacer, a positive regulator of autophagy, has an RH domain with a basic triad predicted to bind an introduced phosphate. Consistent with this, Pacer-RH binds to phosho-RAB7A but not to unphosphorylated RAB7A. In cells, mitochondrial depolarization reduces Rubicon:RAB7A colocalization whilst recruiting Pacer to phospho-RAB7A-positive puncta. Pacer knockout reduces Parkin mitophagy with little effect on bulk autophagy or Parkin-independent mitophagy. Rescue of Parkin-dependent mitophagy requires the intact pRAB7A phosphate-binding basic triad of Pacer. Together these structural and functional data support a model in which the TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of RAB7A serves as a switch, promoting mitophagy by relieving Rubicon inhibition and favoring Pacer activation.\nCaloric restriction promotes beta cell longevity and delays aging and senescence by enhancing cell identity and homeostasis mechanisms.\nAuthors: Santos, C. d.; Shrestha, S.; Cottam, M. A.; Perkins, G.; Lev-Ram, V.; Roy, B.; Acree, C.; Kim, K.-Y.; Deerinck, T.; Cutler, M.; Dean, D.; Cartailler, J. P.; MacDonald, P. E.; Hetzer, M. W.; Ellisman, M. H.; Arrojo e Drigo, R.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554369\nCaloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.\nLearning the sequence code for mRNA and protein abundance in human immune cells\nAuthors: Nicolet, B. P.; Jurgens, A.; Bresser, K.; Guislain, A.; Wolkers, M.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555843\nProtein abundance is defined by transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the code for gene expression could inform novel therapies. Here, we develop a machine learning pipeline, termed SONAR, to decipher the endogenous sequence code that determines mRNA and protein abundance in human cells. SONAR predicts up to 63% of protein abundance independent of promoter or enhancer information, and reveals a strong-yet dynamic-cell-type specific sequence code. The deep knowledge of SONAR provides a map of biologically active sequence features (SFs), which we leveraged to manipulate protein expression and tailor it to a specific cell-type. Beyond its fundamental findings, our work provides novel means to improve immunotherapies and biotechnology applications.\nRepair of DNA double-strand breaks leaves heritable impairment to genome function\nAuthors: Bantele, S. C.; Mordini, I.; Biran, A.; Alcaraz, N.; Wenger, A.; Krietenstein, N.; Groth, A.; Lukas, J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555258\nHaving suffered a DNA breakage, a genomic locus undergoes alterations in 3-D chromatin architecture to facilitate signaling and repair. While cells possess mechanisms to repair damaged DNA, it is unknown whether similar options exist to restore the neighboring chromatin to its naive state. Here, we show that a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) within the topologically associated domain (TAD) harboring the c-MYC locus leaves behind lasting chromatin alterations, which persist after completion of DNA repair and feature conformational changes, increased chromatin compaction and reduced retention of both coding and non-coding RNA species. Unexpectedly, all these newly acquired features of post-repair chromatin are transmitted to subsequent cell generations, where they manifest as heritable functional impairments of the c-MYC locus. These findings uncover a hitherto concealed dimension of DNA breakage, which we term post-repair chromatin fatigue, and which confers heritable impairment of gene function beyond the repair of primary DNA lesions.\nControl of microtubules in neuronal processes by profilin 1 and actomyosin\nAuthors: Cisterna, B. A.; Skruber, K.; Jane, M. L.; Camesi, C. I.; Nguyen, I. D.; Warp, P. V.; Black, J. B.; Butler, M. T.; Bear, J. E.; Read, T.-A.; Vitriol, E. A.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554891\nIn addition to its well-established role in actin assembly, Profilin 1 (PFN1) has been shown to bind to tubulin and alter the polymerization of microtubules. However, whether PFN1s predominant control over microtubules in cells occurs through direct regulation of tubulin or indirectly through the polymerization of actin has yet to be determined. Here we manipulated PFN1 expression, actin filament assembly, and actomyosin contractility and showed that reducing any of these increases the number and acetylation of microtubules, with the effect being significantly more pronounced in neuronal processes. Changes to microtubules are reversible if actomyosin contractility is restored, arguing that PFN1s regulation of microtubules occurs principally through actin. Moreover, the altered microtubules in neuronal processes resulting from PFN1 depletion cause significant changes to microtubule-based transport, mimicking phenotypes that are linked to neurodegenerative disease. Thus, defects in actin dynamics cause a compensatory response in other cytoskeleton components, profoundly effecting cellular function.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multinucleated skeletal muscle cells have an obligatory need to acquire additional nuclei through fusion with activated skeletal muscle stem cells when responding to both developmental and adaptive growth stimuli. A fundamental question in skeletal muscle biology has been the reason underlying this need for new nuclei in syncytial cells that already harbor hundreds of nuclei. To begin to answer this long-standing question, we utilized nuclear RNA-sequencing approaches and developed a lineage tracing strategy capable of defining the transcriptional state of recently fused nuclei and distinguishing this state from that of pre-existing nuclei. Our findings reveal the presence of conserved markers of newly fused nuclei both during development and after a hypertrophic stimulus in the adult. However, newly fused nuclei also exhibit divergent gene expression that is determined by the myogenic environment to which they fuse. Moreover, accrual of new nuclei through fusion is required for nuclei already resident in adult myofibers to mount a normal transcriptional response to a load-inducing stimulus. We propose a model of mutual regulation in the control of skeletal muscle development and adaptations, where newly fused and pre-existing myonuclear populations influence each other to maintain optimal functional growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The prion-like spread of protein aggregates is a leading hypothesis for the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in the brain, including the spread of tau inclusions associated with Alzheimers disease. The mechanisms of cellular uptake of tau seeds and subsequent nucleated polymerization of cytosolic tau are major questions in the field, and the potential for coupling between the entry and nucleation mechanisms has been little explored. We found that in primary astrocytes, endocytosis of tau seeds leads to their accumulation in lysosomes. This in turn leads to lysosomal swelling, deacidification and recruitment of ESCRT proteins, but not Galectin-3, to the lysosomal membrane. These observations are consistent with nanoscale damage of the lysosomal membrane. Using live cell and STORM, imaging, nucleation of cytosolic tau occurs primarily at the lysosome membrane under these conditions. These data suggest that tau seeds escape from lysosomes via nanoscale damage rather than wholesale rupture, and that nucleation of cytosolic tau commences as soon as tau fibril ends emerge from the lysosomal membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The multi-subunit anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a master regulator of cell division. It controls progression through the cell cycle by timely marking mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The APC/C itself is regulated by the sequential action of its coactivator subunits CDC20 and CDH1, post-translational modifications, and its inhibitory binding partners EMI1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In this study, we took advantage of the latest developments in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human APC/C CDH1:EMI1 and apo-APC/C at 2.9 Angstrom and 3.2 Angstrom, respectively, providing novel insights into the regulation of APC/C activity. The high resolution maps allowed the unambigious assignment of a previously unassigned -helix to the N-terminus of CDH1 (CDH1 alpha1) in the APC/C CDH1:EMI1 ternary complex. CDH1 alpha1 binds at the APC1:APC8 interface, thereby interacting with a loop segment of APC1 through electrostatic interactions only provided by CDH1 but not CDC20. We also identified a novel zinc-binding module in APC2, and confirmed the presence of zinc ions experimentally. Finally, due to the higher resolution and well defined density of these maps we were able to build, aided by AlphaFold predictions, several intrinsically disordered regions in different APC/C subunits that play a fundamental role in proper complex assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucose is the primary cellular energy substrate and its metabolism via glycolysis is initiated by the rate-limiting enzyme Hexokinase (HK). In energy-demanding tissues like the brain, HK1 is the prominent isoform, primarily localized on mitochondria, crucial for the efficient coupling of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby ensuring optimal energy generation. Here, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism whereby metabolic sensor enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modulates HK1 activity and its mitochondrial association. OGT catalyzes reversible O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification, influenced by glucose flux-mediated intracellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of HK1s regulatory domain occurs with increased OGT activity, promoting glycolytic metabolon assembly on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This modification enhances HK1s mitochondrial localization, orchestrating glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production. Mutations in HK1s O-GlcNAcylation site reduce ATP generation, affecting presynaptic vesicle release in neurons. Our findings reveal a new pathway linking neuronal metabolism to mitochondrial function through OGT and glycolytic metabolon formation, and provide important insight into the previously unknown metabolism plasticity mechanism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The capacity of B cells to extract immobilized antigens through the formation of an immune synapse can be tuned by the physical characteristics of the surface where antigens are encountered. However, the underlying mechanisms that couple mechanosensing by B cells to antigen extraction and processing remain poorly understood.

We show that B cells activated by antigens associated with stiffer substrates exhibit enhanced spreading responses and higher tubulin acetylation at the center of the immune synapse, where less motile lysosomes preferentially localize. This process is coupled to the translocation of the microtubule acetylase, ATAT1 to the cytoplasm of B cells, which occurs as a mechano-response during BCR stimulation. Accordingly, B cells silenced for ATAT1 are unable to stabilize lysosomes at the synaptic interface and display a lower capacity to extract and present immobilized antigens to T cells.

Overall, these findings highlight how BCR-dependent mechano-responses trigger microtubule network modifications to precisely orchestrate lysosome positioning to promote antigen extraction and presentation in B cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Activation of PINK1 and Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage initiates a cytoprotective mitophagy response that includes phosphorylation of RAB7A at Ser72. Rubicon is a RAB7A binding protein that acts as a negative regulator of autophagy. The structure of the Rubicon-RAB7A complex suggests that phosphorylation of RAB7A at Ser72 would block Rubicon binding. Indeed, in vitro phosphorylation of RAB7A by TBK1 abrogates Rubicon-RAB7A binding. Pacer, a positive regulator of autophagy, has an RH domain with a basic triad predicted to bind an introduced phosphate. Consistent with this, Pacer-RH binds to phosho-RAB7A but not to unphosphorylated RAB7A. In cells, mitochondrial depolarization reduces Rubicon:RAB7A colocalization whilst recruiting Pacer to phospho-RAB7A-positive puncta. Pacer knockout reduces Parkin mitophagy with little effect on bulk autophagy or Parkin-independent mitophagy. Rescue of Parkin-dependent mitophagy requires the intact pRAB7A phosphate-binding basic triad of Pacer. Together these structural and functional data support a model in which the TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of RAB7A serves as a switch, promoting mitophagy by relieving Rubicon inhibition and favoring Pacer activation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Caloric restriction (CR) extends organismal lifespan and health span by improving glucose homeostasis mechanisms. How CR affects organellar structure and function of pancreatic beta cells over the lifetime of the animal remains unknown. Here, we used single nucleus transcriptomics to show that CR increases the expression of genes for beta cell identity, protein processing, and organelle homeostasis. Gene regulatory network analysis link this transcriptional phenotype to transcription factors involved in beta cell identity (Mafa) and homeostasis (Atf6). Imaging metabolomics further demonstrates that CR beta cells are more energetically competent. In fact, high-resolution light and electron microscopy indicates that CR reduces beta cell mitophagy and increases mitochondria mass, increasing mitochondrial ATP generation. Finally, we show that long-term CR delays the onset of beta cell aging and senescence to promote longevity by reducing beta cell turnover. Therefore, CR could be a feasible approach to preserve compromised beta cells during aging and diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein abundance is defined by transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the code for gene expression could inform novel therapies. Here, we develop a machine learning pipeline, termed SONAR, to decipher the endogenous sequence code that determines mRNA and protein abundance in human cells. SONAR predicts up to 63% of protein abundance independent of promoter or enhancer information, and reveals a strong-yet dynamic-cell-type specific sequence code. The deep knowledge of SONAR provides a map of biologically active sequence features (SFs), which we leveraged to manipulate protein expression and tailor it to a specific cell-type. Beyond its fundamental findings, our work provides novel means to improve immunotherapies and biotechnology applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Having suffered a DNA breakage, a genomic locus undergoes alterations in 3-D chromatin architecture to facilitate signaling and repair. While cells possess mechanisms to repair damaged DNA, it is unknown whether similar options exist to restore the neighboring chromatin to its naive state. Here, we show that a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) within the topologically associated domain (TAD) harboring the c-MYC locus leaves behind lasting chromatin alterations, which persist after completion of DNA repair and feature conformational changes, increased chromatin compaction and reduced retention of both coding and non-coding RNA species. Unexpectedly, all these newly acquired features of post-repair chromatin are transmitted to subsequent cell generations, where they manifest as heritable functional impairments of the c-MYC locus. These findings uncover a hitherto concealed dimension of DNA breakage, which we term post-repair chromatin fatigue, and which confers heritable impairment of gene function beyond the repair of primary DNA lesions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In addition to its well-established role in actin assembly, Profilin 1 (PFN1) has been shown to bind to tubulin and alter the polymerization of microtubules. However, whether PFN1s predominant control over microtubules in cells occurs through direct regulation of tubulin or indirectly through the polymerization of actin has yet to be determined. Here we manipulated PFN1 expression, actin filament assembly, and actomyosin contractility and showed that reducing any of these increases the number and acetylation of microtubules, with the effect being significantly more pronounced in neuronal processes. Changes to microtubules are reversible if actomyosin contractility is restored, arguing that PFN1s regulation of microtubules occurs principally through actin. Moreover, the altered microtubules in neuronal processes resulting from PFN1 depletion cause significant changes to microtubule-based transport, mimicking phenotypes that are linked to neurodegenerative disease. Thus, defects in actin dynamics cause a compensatory response in other cytoskeleton components, profoundly effecting cellular function.</p>
