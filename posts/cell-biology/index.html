F.; Cohen, S.\nScore: 54.4, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559820\nMembrane contact sites (MCSs) are sites of close apposition between two organelles used to exchange ions, lipids, and information. Cells respond to changing environmental or developmental conditions by modulating the number, extent, or duration of MCSs. Because of their small size and dynamic nature, tools to study the dynamics of MCSs in live cells have been limited. Dimerization-dependent fluorescent proteins (ddFPs) targeted to organelle membranes are an ideal tool for studying MCS dynamics because they reversibly interact to fluoresce specifically at the interface between two organelles. Here, we build on previous work using ddFPs as sensors to visualize the morphology and dynamics of MCSs. We engineered a suite of ddFPs called Contact-FP that targets ddFP monomers to lipid droplets (LDs), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane, caveolae, and the cytoplasm. We show that these probes correctly localize to their target organelles. Using LDs as a test case, we demonstrate that Contact-FP pairs specifically localize to the interface between two target organelles. Titration of LD-mitochondria ddFPs revealed that these sensors can be used at high concentrations to drive MCSs or can be titrated down to minimally perturb and visualize endogenous MCSs. We show that Contact-FP probes can be used to: (1) visualize LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics, (2) observe changes in LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics upon overexpression of PLIN5, a known LD-mitochondrial tether, and (3) visualize two MCSs that share one organelle simultaneously (e.g., LD-mitochondria and LD-ER MCSs). Contact-FP probes can be optimized to visualize MCSs between any pair of organelles represented in the toolkit.\nA Window into Mammalian Basement Membrane Development: Insights from the mTurq2-Col4a1 Mouse Model\nAuthors: Jones, R. A.; Trejo, B.; Sil, P.; Little, K. A.; Pasolli, H. A.; Joyce, B.; Posfai, E.; Devenport, D.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559396\nBasement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The BMs inherent pliability enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.\nCytoplasmic fluidization triggers breaking spore dormancy in fission yeast.\nAuthors: Sakai, K.; Kondo, Y.; Goto, Y.; Aoki, K.\nScore: 28.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559686\nThe cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules ([~]3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking. Significance statementCellular processes are influenced by the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as crowding and viscoelasticity. Although it has been suggested that cells tune the cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental changes, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used the dormant fission yeast spores and uncovered signaling pathways that facilitate cytoplasmic fluidization during dormancy breaking. Furthermore, we tracked the mobility of intracellular tracer particles, and found that the spore cytoplasm impedes the mobility of larger protein complexes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules. These results suggest that small signaling proteins can diffuse relatively freely in the spore cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals, while the motion of large complexes, such as ribosomes, is restricted.\nStructural basis of lipid head group entry to the Kennedy pathway by FLVCR1\nAuthors: Son, Y.; Kenny, T. C.; Khan, A.; Birsoy, K.; Hite, R. K.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560019\nPhosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively1-6. Despite the importance of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here, we show that FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome PCARP7-9, transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprised of aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, the larger quaternary amine of choline interacts differently with FLVCR1 than does the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are critical for the transport of ethanolamine, while being dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLCVR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway.\nLRRK2 kinase dependent and independent function on endolysosomal repair promotes macrophage cell death\nAuthors: Morrison, R.; Mihaylov, S. R. G.; Luk, C. H.; Rodgers, A.; Athanasiadi, N.; Morris, H.; Pellegrino, E.; Ultanir, S. K.; Gutierrez, M. G.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559807\nLRRK2 is commonly mutated in Parkinsons disease and has cell type-specific mechanisms of activation and function. In macrophages, LRRK2 is associated with lysosomes and is activated following lysosomal damage. However, effects of pathogenic LRRK2-G2019S in macrophages are unknown. Here, using primary mouse and human iPSC-derived macrophage (iPSDM) models of LRRK2-G2019S, we defined the substrates of LRRK2 after lysosomal damage. Using phosphoproteomics we found that LRRK2-G2019S and wild-type macrophages showed similar levels of Rab phosphorylation after lysosomal damage, with the exceptions of Rab12 and Rab35, which were increased and decreased, respectively, in LRRK2-G2019S. LRRK2-G2019S macrophages showed a LRRK2 kinase activity-independent deficit in lysosomal membrane repair which resulted in more cell death and increased apoptosis. Importantly, we recapitulated this phenotype in iPSDM from patients carrying the G2019S mutation, but not in isogenic control iPSDM. Altogether, we define here the signaling downstream of G2019S in macrophages and identify susceptibility to cell death after lysosomal damage as an important phenotype of this mutation.\nASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging\nAuthors: Odawara, T.; Yamauchi, S.; Ichijo, H.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558729\nCellular senescence is a stress-induced, permanent cell cycle arrest involved in tumor suppression and aging. Senescent cells secrete bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been implicated in immune-mediated elimination of senescent cells and age-associated chronic inflammation. However, the mechanisms regulating the SASP are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the stress-responsive kinase ASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging. ASK1 is activated during senescence and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activating p38, a kinase critical for the SASP. ASK1-deficient mice show impaired elimination of oncogene-induced senescent cells and an increased rate of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ASK1 deficiency prevents age-associated p38 activation and inflammation and attenuates glomerulosclerosis. Our results suggest that ASK1 is a driver of the SASP and age-associated chronic inflammation and represents a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.\nMitochondrial outer membrane integrity regulates a ubiquitin-dependent NF-κB inflammatory response\nAuthors: Vringer, E.; Riley, J.; Black, A.; Cloix, C.; Lilla, S.; Walczak, H.; Gyrd-Hansen, M.; Huang, D.; Zanivan, S.; Tait, S.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558776\nMitochondria are often essential for apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This central event enables cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation and rapid cell death. Recently, MOMP has been shown to be inherently pro-inflammatory, for instance, by enabling mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Alongside having emerging functions in health and disease, MOMP associated inflammation can also elicit anti-tumour immunity. Nonetheless, how MOMP triggers inflammation and how the cell counteracts this remains poorly defined. We find that upon MOMP, mitochondria are ubiquitylated in a promiscuous manner targeting proteins localised to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial ubiquitylation serves to recruit the essential adaptor molecule, NEMO, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory NF-{kappa}B signalling. We find that disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through different means leads to engagement of a similar pro-inflammatory signalling platform. Thus, mitochondrial integrity directly controls inflammation, such that permeabilised mitochondria initiate NF-{kappa}B signalling. This event may be important for the various pathophysiological functions of MOMP-associated inflammation.\nUnveiling the ultrastructural landscape of native extracellular matrix via lift-out cryo-FIBSEM and cryo-ET\nAuthors: Zens, B.; Faessler, F.; Hansen, J. M.; Hauschild, R.; Datler, J.; Hodirnau, V.-V.; Zheden, V.; Alanko, J.; Sixt, M.; Schur, F. K.\nScore: 51.7, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559261\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly hydrated, three-dimensional network composed of various macromolecules and signaling factors. It serves as a structural scaffold for cells and plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Despite its importance in metazoans, structural knowledge is rudimentary on how the components of the matrisome are secreted, remodeled, and interact with each other and with surrounding cells. Specifically, the exact molecular assembly of important ECM fibers, such as fibronectin fibrils, fibrillin microfibrils, or Collagen-VI filaments has remained enigmatic. This is largely due to methodological limitations in specimen preparation for conventional room-temperature electron microscopy (EM). To overcome these limitations, we have developed a cell culture-based 3D-ECM platform compatible with sample thinning by cryo-lift out focused ion beam (FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our workflow involves the implementation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) grown on EM grids, resulting in a highly adaptable and versatile tool to closely mimic ECM environments. This allows us to visualize native ECM and its components for the first time in their fully hydrated, cellular context. Our data reveals an intricate network of ECM fibers and their positioning with respect to matrix-secreting cells. In addition to D-spaced collagen fibers, we visualize previously unresolved fibrous structures, and an amorphous matrix co-assembling in proximity to ECM fibers and delineating the boundary between ECM and empty extra-cellular space. Intra- and extracellular granules presumably represent assembly intermediates of the ECM. Our results add to the structural atlas of the ECM and provide novel insights into ECM secretion, assembly and maintenance.\nBarcoding of small extracellular vesicles with CRISPR-gRNA enables comprehensive, subpopulation-specific analysis of their biogenesis/release regulators\nAuthors: Kunitake, K.; Mizuno, T.; Hattori, K.; Oneyama, C.; Kamiya, M.; Ota, S.; Urano, Y.; Kojima, R.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559700\nSmall extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are important intercellular information transmitters in various biological contexts, but their release processes remain poorly understood. Herein, we describe a high-throughput assay platform, CRISPR-assisted individually barcoded sEV-based release regulator (CIBER) screening, for identifying key players in sEV release. CIBER screening employs sEVs barcoded with CRISPR-gRNA through the interaction of gRNA and dead Cas9 fused with an sEV marker. Barcode quantification enables the estimation of the sEV amount released from each cell in a massively parallel manner. Barcoding sEVs with different sEV markers in a CRISPR pooled-screening format allows genome-wide exploration of sEV release regulators in a subpopulation-specific manner, successfully identifying previously unknown sEV release regulators and uncovering the exosomal/ectosomal nature of CD63+/CD9+ sEVs, respectively, as well as the synchronization of CD9+ sEV release with the cell cycle. CIBER should be a valuable tool for detailed studies on the biogenesis, release, and heterogeneity of sEVs.\nBBQ methods: Streamlined workflows for Bacterial Burden Quantification in infected cells by confocal microscopy\nAuthors: Augenstreich, J.; Shuster, M. J.; Lyu, Z.; Fan, Y.; Ling, J.; Briken, V.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560379\nAccurate quantification of bacterial burden within macrophages, termed Bacterial Burden Quantification (BBQ), is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions. Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden. These automated workflows offer valuable tools for studying bacterial interactions within host cells and provide insights for various research applications.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are sites of close apposition between two organelles used to exchange ions, lipids, and information. Cells respond to changing environmental or developmental conditions by modulating the number, extent, or duration of MCSs. Because of their small size and dynamic nature, tools to study the dynamics of MCSs in live cells have been limited. Dimerization-dependent fluorescent proteins (ddFPs) targeted to organelle membranes are an ideal tool for studying MCS dynamics because they reversibly interact to fluoresce specifically at the interface between two organelles. Here, we build on previous work using ddFPs as sensors to visualize the morphology and dynamics of MCSs. We engineered a suite of ddFPs called Contact-FP that targets ddFP monomers to lipid droplets (LDs), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane, caveolae, and the cytoplasm. We show that these probes correctly localize to their target organelles. Using LDs as a test case, we demonstrate that Contact-FP pairs specifically localize to the interface between two target organelles. Titration of LD-mitochondria ddFPs revealed that these sensors can be used at high concentrations to drive MCSs or can be titrated down to minimally perturb and visualize endogenous MCSs. We show that Contact-FP probes can be used to: (1) visualize LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics, (2) observe changes in LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics upon overexpression of PLIN5, a known LD-mitochondrial tether, and (3) visualize two MCSs that share one organelle simultaneously (e.g., LD-mitochondria and LD-ER MCSs). Contact-FP probes can be optimized to visualize MCSs between any pair of organelles represented in the toolkit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The BMs inherent pliability enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules ([~]3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking.

Significance statementCellular processes are influenced by the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as crowding and viscoelasticity. Although it has been suggested that cells tune the cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental changes, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used the dormant fission yeast spores and uncovered signaling pathways that facilitate cytoplasmic fluidization during dormancy breaking. Furthermore, we tracked the mobility of intracellular tracer particles, and found that the spore cytoplasm impedes the mobility of larger protein complexes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules. These results suggest that small signaling proteins can diffuse relatively freely in the spore cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals, while the motion of large complexes, such as ribosomes, is restricted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively1-6. Despite the importance of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here, we show that FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome PCARP7-9, transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprised of aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, the larger quaternary amine of choline interacts differently with FLVCR1 than does the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are critical for the transport of ethanolamine, while being dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLCVR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway.</p>

        <p class="abstract">LRRK2 is commonly mutated in Parkinsons disease and has cell type-specific mechanisms of activation and function. In macrophages, LRRK2 is associated with lysosomes and is activated following lysosomal damage. However, effects of pathogenic LRRK2-G2019S in macrophages are unknown. Here, using primary mouse and human iPSC-derived macrophage (iPSDM) models of LRRK2-G2019S, we defined the substrates of LRRK2 after lysosomal damage. Using phosphoproteomics we found that LRRK2-G2019S and wild-type macrophages showed similar levels of Rab phosphorylation after lysosomal damage, with the exceptions of Rab12 and Rab35, which were increased and decreased, respectively, in LRRK2-G2019S. LRRK2-G2019S macrophages showed a LRRK2 kinase activity-independent deficit in lysosomal membrane repair which resulted in more cell death and increased apoptosis. Importantly, we recapitulated this phenotype in iPSDM from patients carrying the G2019S mutation, but not in isogenic control iPSDM. Altogether, we define here the signaling downstream of G2019S in macrophages and identify susceptibility to cell death after lysosomal damage as an important phenotype of this mutation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular senescence is a stress-induced, permanent cell cycle arrest involved in tumor suppression and aging. Senescent cells secrete bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been implicated in immune-mediated elimination of senescent cells and age-associated chronic inflammation. However, the mechanisms regulating the SASP are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the stress-responsive kinase ASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging. ASK1 is activated during senescence and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activating p38, a kinase critical for the SASP. ASK1-deficient mice show impaired elimination of oncogene-induced senescent cells and an increased rate of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ASK1 deficiency prevents age-associated p38 activation and inflammation and attenuates glomerulosclerosis. Our results suggest that ASK1 is a driver of the SASP and age-associated chronic inflammation and represents a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria are often essential for apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This central event enables cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation and rapid cell death. Recently, MOMP has been shown to be inherently pro-inflammatory, for instance, by enabling mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Alongside having emerging functions in health and disease, MOMP associated inflammation can also elicit anti-tumour immunity. Nonetheless, how MOMP triggers inflammation and how the cell counteracts this remains poorly defined. We find that upon MOMP, mitochondria are ubiquitylated in a promiscuous manner targeting proteins localised to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial ubiquitylation serves to recruit the essential adaptor molecule, NEMO, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory NF-{kappa}B signalling. We find that disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through different means leads to engagement of a similar pro-inflammatory signalling platform. Thus, mitochondrial integrity directly controls inflammation, such that permeabilised mitochondria initiate NF-{kappa}B signalling. This event may be important for the various pathophysiological functions of MOMP-associated inflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly hydrated, three-dimensional network composed of various macromolecules and signaling factors. It serves as a structural scaffold for cells and plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Despite its importance in metazoans, structural knowledge is rudimentary on how the components of the matrisome are secreted, remodeled, and interact with each other and with surrounding cells. Specifically, the exact molecular assembly of important ECM fibers, such as fibronectin fibrils, fibrillin microfibrils, or Collagen-VI filaments has remained enigmatic. This is largely due to methodological limitations in specimen preparation for conventional room-temperature electron microscopy (EM).

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a cell culture-based 3D-ECM platform compatible with sample thinning by cryo-lift out focused ion beam (FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our workflow involves the implementation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) grown on EM grids, resulting in a highly adaptable and versatile tool to closely mimic ECM environments. This allows us to visualize native ECM and its components for the first time in their fully hydrated, cellular context. Our data reveals an intricate network of ECM fibers and their positioning with respect to matrix-secreting cells. In addition to D-spaced collagen fibers, we visualize previously unresolved fibrous structures, and an amorphous matrix co-assembling in proximity to ECM fibers and delineating the boundary between ECM and empty extra-cellular space. Intra- and extracellular granules presumably represent assembly intermediates of the ECM. Our results add to the structural atlas of the ECM and provide novel insights into ECM secretion, assembly and maintenance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are important intercellular information transmitters in various biological contexts, but their release processes remain poorly understood. Herein, we describe a high-throughput assay platform, CRISPR-assisted individually barcoded sEV-based release regulator (CIBER) screening, for identifying key players in sEV release. CIBER screening employs sEVs barcoded with CRISPR-gRNA through the interaction of gRNA and dead Cas9 fused with an sEV marker. Barcode quantification enables the estimation of the sEV amount released from each cell in a massively parallel manner. Barcoding sEVs with different sEV markers in a CRISPR pooled-screening format allows genome-wide exploration of sEV release regulators in a subpopulation-specific manner, successfully identifying previously unknown sEV release regulators and uncovering the exosomal/ectosomal nature of CD63&#43;/CD9&#43; sEVs, respectively, as well as the synchronization of CD9&#43; sEV release with the cell cycle. CIBER should be a valuable tool for detailed studies on the biogenesis, release, and heterogeneity of sEVs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate quantification of bacterial burden within macrophages, termed Bacterial Burden Quantification (BBQ), is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions. Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden. These automated workflows offer valuable tools for studying bacterial interactions within host cells and provide insights for various research applications.</p>
