A.; Nuthalapati, P.; Sunder Singh, J. P.; Maity, S.; Ning, D.; Shryock, D. G.; Xuan, Z.; Joshi, P. A.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573587\nExcess fat gain culminating in obesity is a mounting global pandemic associated with a myriad of diseases including a higher risk of developing multiple cancers such as breast cancer. The underlying biological basis for obesity-linked breast cancer is attributed to alterations in adipose tissue-derived endocrine, metabolic and inflammatory factors. However, the precise cell types responsible for generating a cancer-susceptible mammary gland in obesity are not well understood. Using diet-induced obesity in conjunction with genetic reporter mouse models, we reveal elevated mammary adipocyte progenitors (MAPs) expressing Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor alpha (PDGFR) in the mammary tissue microenvironment during obesity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrate intensified obesity-driven trajectories of MAPs to immune and epithelial progenitor cells. Further, lineage tracing indicates an invasive cellular state of MAPs that confers greater access of MAP descendants into the mammary epithelium concomitant with their transition into immune and epithelial cell fates. MAPs in obesity exhibit heightened activation of cancer-associated and inflammatory pathways where Egfr is identified as a common target upregulated in MAPs. Mechanistic studies on purified MAPs with a major obesity diet component and EGFR stimulation corroborate dynamic EGFR-mediated MAP responses. Our findings uncover MAPs as key contributors to forging an aberrant mammary gland in obesity, providing insight into the potential utility of targeting this cell lineage for eradicating cancer risk related to augmented adiposity.\nA Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST) for the high-throughput quantification of senescence-associated markers\nAuthors: Neri, F.; Takajjart, S. N.; Lerner, C. A.; Desprez, P.-Y.; Schilling, B.; Campisi, J.; Gerencser, A. A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573123\nCellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions. Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.\nThe role of satellite cell-derived TRIM28 in mechanical load- and injury-induced myogenesis\nAuthors: Lin, K.-H.; Hibbert, J. E.; Lemens, J. L.; Torbey, M. M.; Steinert, N. D.; Flejsierowicz, P. M.; Melka, K. M.; Lares, M.; Setaluri, V.; Hornberger, T. A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572566\nSatellite cells are skeletal muscle stem cells that contribute to postnatal muscle growth, and they endow skeletal muscle with the ability to regenerate after a severe injury. Here we discovered that this myogenic potential of satellite cells requires a protein called tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28). Unexpectedly, multiple lines of both in vitro and in vivo evidence revealed that the myogenic function of TRIM28 is not dependent on changes in the phosphorylation of its serine 473 residue. Moreover, the functions of TRIM28 were not mediated through the regulation of satellite cell proliferation or differentiation. Instead, our findings indicate that TRIM28 regulates the ability of satellite cells to progress through the process of fusion. Specifically, we discovered that TRIM28 controls the expression of a fusogenic protein called myomixer and concomitant fusion pore formation. Collectively, the outcomes of this study expose the framework of a novel regulatory pathway that is essential for myogenesis.\nEvidence of 14-3-3 proteins contributing to kinetochore integrity and chromosome congression during mitosis\nAuthors: Ghosh, S. K.; Anbalagan, G. K.; Agarwal, P.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573259\nThe 14-3-3 family of proteins are conserved across eukaryotes and serve myriad important regulatory functions of the cell. Homo/heterodimers of these protein homologs, majorly recognize their ligands via conserved motifs from a plethora of cellular proteins to modulate the localization and functions of those effector ligands. In most of the genetic backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, disruption of both 14-3-3 homologs (Bmh1 and Bmh2) are either lethal or survive with severe growth defects showing gross chromosomal missegregation and prolonged cell cycle arrest. To elucidate their contributions to chromosome segregation, in this work we investigated their centromere/kinetochore-related functions. Analysis of appropriate deletion mutants shows that Bmh isoforms have cumulative and unshared isoform-specific contributions in maintaining the proper integrity of the kinetochore ensemble. Consequently, bmh mutant cells exhibited perturbations in kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) dynamics, characterized by kinetochore declustering, mis-localization of kinetochore proteins, and Mad2-mediated transient G2/M arrest. These defects also caused an asynchronous chromosome congression in bmh mutants during metaphase. In summary, this report advances the knowledge on contributions of budding yeast 14-3-3 proteins in chromosome segregation by demonstrating their roles in kinetochore integrity and chromosome congression.\nRibosome Quality Control Mechanism Mitigates the Cytotoxic Impacts of Ribosome Collisions Induced by 5-Fluorouracil\nAuthors: Chatterjee, S.; Naeli, P.; Simms, N.; Garzia, A.; Hackett, A.; Coyle, K.; Harris Snell, P.; McGirr, T.; Sawant, T. N.; Dang, K.; Stoichkova, Z. V.; Alain, T.; Tuschl, T.; McDade, S. S.; Longley, D.; Gkogkas, C. G.; Adrain, C.; Knight, J. R. P.; Jafarnejad, S. M.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573247\nTranslation of aberrant or damaged mRNAs results in ribosome stalling and collisions. The Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) mechanism detects collided ribosomes and removes aberrant mRNAs and nascent peptides, thus preventing their cytotoxic effects. Conversely, excessive or unresolved ribosome collisions can induce apoptosis. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) forms the backbone of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens for several types of cancer. Although best known for its incorporation into DNA and inhibition of thymidylate synthase, a major determinant of 5FUs anticancer activity is its incorporation into RNAs. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) underlying RNA-dependent 5FU cytotoxicity and the cellular response to its impact on RNA metabolism remain unclear. Here, we report a key role for RQC in mitigating the cytotoxic effects of 5FU-induced dysregulation of mRNA translation. We show that acute 5FU treatment results in the rapid induction of the mTOR signalling pathway, an enhanced rate of mRNA translation initiation, and increased ribosome collisions that trigger RQC. We also found that RQC deficiency, caused by the depletion of ZNF598, results in increased 5FU-induced cell death, a phenotype that is reversed by inhibition of mTOR or repression of mRNA translation initiation. Importantly, 5FU treatment enhances the expression of key RQC factors, including ZNF598 and GIGYF2, via an mTOR-dependent post-translational regulation mechanism. This acute adaptation likely mitigates the cytotoxic consequences of increased ribosome collisions upon 5FU treatment. Overall, our data indicate a heretofore unknown mTOR-dependent mechanism that augments the RQC process, mitigating the cytotoxicity of 5FU and undermining its anticancer efficacy.\nPiezo initiates transient production of collagen IV to repair damaged basement membranes\nAuthors: Stricker, A.; Hutson, M. S.; Page-McCaw, A.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573147\nBasement membranes are sheets of extracellular matrix separating tissue layers and providing mechanical support. Their mechanical properties are determined largely by their most abundant protein, Collagen IV (Col4). Although basement membranes are repaired after damage, little is known about how. To wit, since basement membrane is extracellular it is unknown how damage is detected, and since Col4 is long-lived it is unknown how it is regulated to avoid fibrosis. Using the basement membrane of the adult Drosophila midgut as a model, we show that repair is distinct from maintenance. In healthy conditions, midgut Col4 originates from the fat body, but after damage, a subpopulation of enteroblasts we term \"matrix menders\" transiently express Col4, and Col4 from these cells is required for repair. Activation of the mechanosensitive channel Piezo is required for matrix menders to upregulate Col4, and the signal to initiate repair is a reduction in basement membrane stiffness. Our data suggests that mechanical sensitivity may be a general property of Col4-producing cells.

N.; Martin, A.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573057\nThe movements that give rise to the bodys structure are powered by cell shape changes and rearrangements that are coordinated at supracellular scales. How such cellular coordination arises and integrates different morphogenetic programs is unclear. Using quantitative imaging, we found a complex pattern of adherens junction (AJ) levels in the ectoderm prior to gastrulation onset in Drosophila. AJ intensity exhibited a double- sided gradient, with peaks at the dorsal midline and ventral neuroectoderm. We show that this dorsal-ventral AJ pattern is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and that this signal is required for ectoderm cell movement during mesoderm invagination and axis extension. We identify AJ levels and junctional actomyosin as downstream effectors of EGFR signaling. Overall, our study demonstrates a mechanism of coordination between tissue folding and convergent extension that facilitates embryo-wide gastrulation movements.\nSingle tissue proteomics in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals proteins resident in intestinal lysosome-related organelles\nAuthors: Tan, C.-H.; Wang, T.-Y.; Park, H.; Lomenick, B.; Chou, T.-F.; Sternberg, P. W.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573592\nThe nematode intestine is the primary site for nutrient uptake and storage as well as the synthesis of biomolecules; lysosome related organelles known as gut granules are important for many of these functions. Aspects of intestine biology are not well understood, including the export of the nutrients it imports and the molecules it synthesizes, as well as the complete functions and protein content of the gut granules. Here, we report a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the intestine of the Caenorhabditis elegans and of its gut granules. Overall, we identified approximately 5,000 proteins each in the intestine and the gonad and showed that most of these proteins can be detected in samples extracted from a single worm, suggesting the feasibility of individual-level genetic analysis using proteomes. Comparing proteomes and published transcriptomes of the intestine and the gonad, we identified proteins that appear to be synthesized in the intestine and then transferred to the gonad. To identify gut granule proteins, we compared the proteome of individual intestines deficient in gut granules to the wild-type. The identified gut granule proteome includes proteins known to be exclusively localized to the granules and additional putative novel gut granule proteins. We selected two of these putative gut granule proteins for validation via immunohistochemistry, and our successful confirmation of both suggests that our strategy was effective in identifying the gut granule proteome. Our results demonstrate the practicability of single tissue mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis in small organisms and in its utility for making discoveries.\nDual-specificity phosphatases 13 and 27 as key switches in muscle stem cell transition from proliferation to differentiation\nAuthors: Hayashi, T.; Sadaki, S.; Tsuji, R.; Okada, R.; Fuseya, S.; Kanai, M.; Nakamura, A.; Okamura, Y.; Muratani, M.; Wenchao, G.; Sugasawa, T.; Mizuno, S.; Warabi, E.; Kudo, T.; Takahashi, S.; Fujita, R.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.570044\nMuscle regeneration depends on muscle stem cell (MuSCs) activity. These cells are typically quiescent but become activated upon muscle injury, transitioning from proliferation to differentiation. Myogenic regulatory factors, including myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD), regulate the fate transition of MuSCs. However, the role of MYOD in this process is not yet clear. Using previously established MyoD knock-in (MyoD-KI) mice, we revealed that MyoD targets dual-specificity phosphatase (Dusp) 13 and Dusp27. In Dusp13:Dusp27 double knock-out (DKO) mice, the ability for muscle regeneration after injury was found to be reduced. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing of MyoD-high expressing MuSCs from MyoD-KI mice revealed that Dusp13 and Dusp27 are only expressed in specific populations within MyoD-high MuSCs, which also express Myogenin. Overexpressing Dusp13 in MuSCs causes premature muscle differentiation. Thus, we propose a model where DUSP13 and DUSP27 contribute to the fate transition of MuSCs from proliferation to differentiation during myogenesis.\nThe actin-spectrin submembrane scaffold restricts endocytosis along proximal axons\nAuthors: Wernert, F.; Moparthi, S. B.; Laine, J.; Moulay, G.; Boroni-Rueda, F.; Pelletier, F.; Jullien, N.; Benkhelifa-Ziyat, S.; Papandreou, M.-J.; Leterrier, C.; Vassilopoulos, S.\nScore: 40.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572337\nNeuronal clathrin-mediated endocytosis has unique features in compartments such as dendrites and presynaptic boutons, but how membrane and extracellular components are internalized along the axon shaft remains poorly known. Here we focused on clathrin-coated structures and endocytosis along the axon initial segment (AIS), and their relationship to the periodic actin-spectrin scaffold that lines the axonal plasma membrane. Super-resolution optical microscopy, platinum replica electron microscopy, and their correlative combination on cultured hippocampal neurons reveal that in the AIS, clathrin-coated pits form on bare membrane patches, [~]300 nm circular areas devoid of spectrin mesh and lined by actin filaments we termed \"clearings\". In fibroblasts and the proximal axon of neurons, spectrin depletion and drug-induced scaffold disorganization increase clathrin-coated pit formation. However, the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the AIS is not directly linked to actual endocytosis: using cargo uptake and live-cell imaging experiments, we find that most AIS clathrin-coated pits are long-lived and immobile within the spectrin mesh clearings. Direct perturbation of the spectrin scaffold as well as elevated neuronal activity could induce endocytosis downstream of clathrin pit formation, showing that spectrin clearings are structures responsible for regulated endocytosis at the AIS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Excess fat gain culminating in obesity is a mounting global pandemic associated with a myriad of diseases including a higher risk of developing multiple cancers such as breast cancer. The underlying biological basis for obesity-linked breast cancer is attributed to alterations in adipose tissue-derived endocrine, metabolic and inflammatory factors. However, the precise cell types responsible for generating a cancer-susceptible mammary gland in obesity are not well understood. Using diet-induced obesity in conjunction with genetic reporter mouse models, we reveal elevated mammary adipocyte progenitors (MAPs) expressing Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor alpha (PDGFR) in the mammary tissue microenvironment during obesity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrate intensified obesity-driven trajectories of MAPs to immune and epithelial progenitor cells. Further, lineage tracing indicates an invasive cellular state of MAPs that confers greater access of MAP descendants into the mammary epithelium concomitant with their transition into immune and epithelial cell fates. MAPs in obesity exhibit heightened activation of cancer-associated and inflammatory pathways where Egfr is identified as a common target upregulated in MAPs. Mechanistic studies on purified MAPs with a major obesity diet component and EGFR stimulation corroborate dynamic EGFR-mediated MAP responses. Our findings uncover MAPs as key contributors to forging an aberrant mammary gland in obesity, providing insight into the potential utility of targeting this cell lineage for eradicating cancer risk related to augmented adiposity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions.

Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Satellite cells are skeletal muscle stem cells that contribute to postnatal muscle growth, and they endow skeletal muscle with the ability to regenerate after a severe injury. Here we discovered that this myogenic potential of satellite cells requires a protein called tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28). Unexpectedly, multiple lines of both in vitro and in vivo evidence revealed that the myogenic function of TRIM28 is not dependent on changes in the phosphorylation of its serine 473 residue. Moreover, the functions of TRIM28 were not mediated through the regulation of satellite cell proliferation or differentiation. Instead, our findings indicate that TRIM28 regulates the ability of satellite cells to progress through the process of fusion. Specifically, we discovered that TRIM28 controls the expression of a fusogenic protein called myomixer and concomitant fusion pore formation. Collectively, the outcomes of this study expose the framework of a novel regulatory pathway that is essential for myogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 14-3-3 family of proteins are conserved across eukaryotes and serve myriad important regulatory functions of the cell. Homo/heterodimers of these protein homologs, majorly recognize their ligands via conserved motifs from a plethora of cellular proteins to modulate the localization and functions of those effector ligands. In most of the genetic backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, disruption of both 14-3-3 homologs (Bmh1 and Bmh2) are either lethal or survive with severe growth defects showing gross chromosomal missegregation and prolonged cell cycle arrest. To elucidate their contributions to chromosome segregation, in this work we investigated their centromere/kinetochore-related functions. Analysis of appropriate deletion mutants shows that Bmh isoforms have cumulative and unshared isoform-specific contributions in maintaining the proper integrity of the kinetochore ensemble. Consequently, bmh mutant cells exhibited perturbations in kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) dynamics, characterized by kinetochore declustering, mis-localization of kinetochore proteins, and Mad2-mediated transient G2/M arrest. These defects also caused an asynchronous chromosome congression in bmh mutants during metaphase. In summary, this report advances the knowledge on contributions of budding yeast 14-3-3 proteins in chromosome segregation by demonstrating their roles in kinetochore integrity and chromosome congression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Translation of aberrant or damaged mRNAs results in ribosome stalling and collisions. The Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) mechanism detects collided ribosomes and removes aberrant mRNAs and nascent peptides, thus preventing their cytotoxic effects. Conversely, excessive or unresolved ribosome collisions can induce apoptosis. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) forms the backbone of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens for several types of cancer. Although best known for its incorporation into DNA and inhibition of thymidylate synthase, a major determinant of 5FUs anticancer activity is its incorporation into RNAs. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) underlying RNA-dependent 5FU cytotoxicity and the cellular response to its impact on RNA metabolism remain unclear. Here, we report a key role for RQC in mitigating the cytotoxic effects of 5FU-induced dysregulation of mRNA translation. We show that acute 5FU treatment results in the rapid induction of the mTOR signalling pathway, an enhanced rate of mRNA translation initiation, and increased ribosome collisions that trigger RQC. We also found that RQC deficiency, caused by the depletion of ZNF598, results in increased 5FU-induced cell death, a phenotype that is reversed by inhibition of mTOR or repression of mRNA translation initiation. Importantly, 5FU treatment enhances the expression of key RQC factors, including ZNF598 and GIGYF2, via an mTOR-dependent post-translational regulation mechanism. This acute adaptation likely mitigates the cytotoxic consequences of increased ribosome collisions upon 5FU treatment. Overall, our data indicate a heretofore unknown mTOR-dependent mechanism that augments the RQC process, mitigating the cytotoxicity of 5FU and undermining its anticancer efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basement membranes are sheets of extracellular matrix separating tissue layers and providing mechanical support. Their mechanical properties are determined largely by their most abundant protein, Collagen IV (Col4). Although basement membranes are repaired after damage, little is known about how. To wit, since basement membrane is extracellular it is unknown how damage is detected, and since Col4 is long-lived it is unknown how it is regulated to avoid fibrosis. Using the basement membrane of the adult Drosophila midgut as a model, we show that repair is distinct from maintenance. In healthy conditions, midgut Col4 originates from the fat body, but after damage, a subpopulation of enteroblasts we term &#34;matrix menders&#34; transiently express Col4, and Col4 from these cells is required for repair. Activation of the mechanosensitive channel Piezo is required for matrix menders to upregulate Col4, and the signal to initiate repair is a reduction in basement membrane stiffness. Our data suggests that mechanical sensitivity may be a general property of Col4-producing cells.

        <p class="abstract">The movements that give rise to the bodys structure are powered by cell shape changes and rearrangements that are coordinated at supracellular scales. How such cellular coordination arises and integrates different morphogenetic programs is unclear. Using quantitative imaging, we found a complex pattern of adherens junction (AJ) levels in the ectoderm prior to gastrulation onset in Drosophila. AJ intensity exhibited a double- sided gradient, with peaks at the dorsal midline and ventral neuroectoderm. We show that this dorsal-ventral AJ pattern is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and that this signal is required for ectoderm cell movement during mesoderm invagination and axis extension. We identify AJ levels and junctional actomyosin as downstream effectors of EGFR signaling. Overall, our study demonstrates a mechanism of coordination between tissue folding and convergent extension that facilitates embryo-wide gastrulation movements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The nematode intestine is the primary site for nutrient uptake and storage as well as the synthesis of biomolecules; lysosome related organelles known as gut granules are important for many of these functions. Aspects of intestine biology are not well understood, including the export of the nutrients it imports and the molecules it synthesizes, as well as the complete functions and protein content of the gut granules. Here, we report a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the intestine of the Caenorhabditis elegans and of its gut granules. Overall, we identified approximately 5,000 proteins each in the intestine and the gonad and showed that most of these proteins can be detected in samples extracted from a single worm, suggesting the feasibility of individual-level genetic analysis using proteomes. Comparing proteomes and published transcriptomes of the intestine and the gonad, we identified proteins that appear to be synthesized in the intestine and then transferred to the gonad. To identify gut granule proteins, we compared the proteome of individual intestines deficient in gut granules to the wild-type. The identified gut granule proteome includes proteins known to be exclusively localized to the granules and additional putative novel gut granule proteins. We selected two of these putative gut granule proteins for validation via immunohistochemistry, and our successful confirmation of both suggests that our strategy was effective in identifying the gut granule proteome. Our results demonstrate the practicability of single tissue mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis in small organisms and in its utility for making discoveries.</p>

These cells are typically quiescent but become activated upon muscle injury, transitioning from proliferation to differentiation. Myogenic regulatory factors, including myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD), regulate the fate transition of MuSCs. However, the role of MYOD in this process is not yet clear. Using previously established MyoD knock-in (MyoD-KI) mice, we revealed that MyoD targets dual-specificity phosphatase (Dusp) 13 and Dusp27. In Dusp13:Dusp27 double knock-out (DKO) mice, the ability for muscle regeneration after injury was found to be reduced. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing of MyoD-high expressing MuSCs from MyoD-KI mice revealed that Dusp13 and Dusp27 are only expressed in specific populations within MyoD-high MuSCs, which also express Myogenin. Overexpressing Dusp13 in MuSCs causes premature muscle differentiation. Thus, we propose a model where DUSP13 and DUSP27 contribute to the fate transition of MuSCs from proliferation to differentiation during myogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuronal clathrin-mediated endocytosis has unique features in compartments such as dendrites and presynaptic boutons, but how membrane and extracellular components are internalized along the axon shaft remains poorly known. Here we focused on clathrin-coated structures and endocytosis along the axon initial segment (AIS), and their relationship to the periodic actin-spectrin scaffold that lines the axonal plasma membrane. Super-resolution optical microscopy, platinum replica electron microscopy, and their correlative combination on cultured hippocampal neurons reveal that in the AIS, clathrin-coated pits form on bare membrane patches, [~]300 nm circular areas devoid of spectrin mesh and lined by actin filaments we termed &#34;clearings&#34;. In fibroblasts and the proximal axon of neurons, spectrin depletion and drug-induced scaffold disorganization increase clathrin-coated pit formation. However, the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the AIS is not directly linked to actual endocytosis: using cargo uptake and live-cell imaging experiments, we find that most AIS clathrin-coated pits are long-lived and immobile within the spectrin mesh clearings. Direct perturbation of the spectrin scaffold as well as elevated neuronal activity could induce endocytosis downstream of clathrin pit formation, showing that spectrin clearings are structures responsible for regulated endocytosis at the AIS.</p>
