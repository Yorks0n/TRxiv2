D.\nScore: 135.7, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572249\nDefining the subcellular distribution of all human proteins and its remodeling across cellular states remains a central goal in cell biology. Here, we present a high-resolution strategy to map subcellular organization using organelle immuno-capture coupled to mass spectrometry. We apply this proteomics workflow to a cell-wide collection of membranous and membrane-less compartments. A graph-based representation of our data reveals the subcellular localization of over 7,600 proteins, defines spatial protein networks, and uncovers interconnections between cellular compartments. We demonstrate that our approach can be deployed to comprehensively profile proteome remodeling during cellular perturbation. By characterizing the cellular landscape following hCoV-OC43 viral infection, we discover that many proteins are regulated by changes in their spatial distribution rather than by changes in their total abundance. Our results establish that proteome-wide analysis of subcellular remodeling provides essential insights for the elucidation of cellular responses. Our dataset can be explored at organelles.czbiohub.org.\nMantis: high-throughput 4D imaging and analysis of the molecular and physical architecture of cells\nAuthors: Ivanov, I. E.; Hirata-Miyasaki, E.; Chandler, T.; Kovilakam, R. C.; Liu, Z.; Liu, C.; Leonetti, M. D.; Huang, B.; Mehta, S. B.\nScore: 42.9, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572435\nHigh-throughput dynamic imaging of cells and organelles is important for parsing complex cellular responses. We report a high-throughput 4D microscope, named Mantis, that combines two complementary, gentle, live-imaging technologies: remote-refocus label-free microscopy and oblique light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We also report open-source software for automated acquisition, registration, and reconstruction, and virtual staining software for single-cell segmentation and phenotyping. Mantis enabled high-content correlative imaging of molecular components and the physical architecture of 20 cell lines every 15 minutes over 7.5 hours, and also detailed measurements of the impacts of viral infection on the architecture of host cells and host proteins. The Mantis platform can enable high-throughput profiling of intracellular dynamics, long-term imaging and analysis of cellular responses to stress, and live cell optical screens to dissect gene regulatory networks.\nThe actin-spectrin submembrane scaffold restricts endocytosis along proximal axons\nAuthors: Wernert, F.; Moparthi, S. B.; Laine, J.; Moulay, G.; Boroni-Rueda, F.; Pelletier, F.; Jullien, N.; Benkhelifa-Ziyat, S.; Papandreou, M.-J.; Leterrier, C.; Vassilopoulos, S.\nScore: 36.7, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572337\nNeuronal clathrin-mediated endocytosis has unique features in compartments such as dendrites and presynaptic boutons, but how membrane and extracellular components are internalized along the axon shaft remains poorly known. Here we focused on clathrin-coated structures and endocytosis along the axon initial segment (AIS), and their relationship to the periodic actin-spectrin scaffold that lines the axonal plasma membrane. Super-resolution optical microscopy, platinum replica electron microscopy, and their correlative combination on cultured hippocampal neurons reveal that in the AIS, clathrin-coated pits form on bare membrane patches, [~]300 nm circular areas devoid of spectrin mesh and lined by actin filaments we termed \"clearings\". In fibroblasts and the proximal axon of neurons, spectrin depletion and drug-induced scaffold disorganization increase clathrin-coated pit formation. However, the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the AIS is not directly linked to actual endocytosis: using cargo uptake and live-cell imaging experiments, we find that most AIS clathrin-coated pits are long-lived and immobile within the spectrin mesh clearings. Direct perturbation of the spectrin scaffold as well as elevated neuronal activity could induce endocytosis downstream of clathrin pit formation, showing that spectrin clearings are structures responsible for regulated endocytosis at the AIS.\nEGFR-dependent actomyosin patterning coordinates morphogenetic movements between tissues\nAuthors: Clarke, D. N.; Martin, A.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573057\nThe movements that give rise to the bodys structure are powered by cell shape changes and rearrangements that are coordinated at supracellular scales. How such cellular coordination arises and integrates different morphogenetic programs is unclear. Using quantitative imaging, we found a complex pattern of adherens junction (AJ) levels in the ectoderm prior to gastrulation onset in Drosophila. AJ intensity exhibited a double- sided gradient, with peaks at the dorsal midline and ventral neuroectoderm. We show that this dorsal-ventral AJ pattern is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and that this signal is required for ectoderm cell movement during mesoderm invagination and axis extension. We identify AJ levels and junctional actomyosin as downstream effectors of EGFR signaling. Overall, our study demonstrates a mechanism of coordination between tissue folding and convergent extension that facilitates embryo-wide gastrulation movements.\nThe dCMP deaminase DCTD and the E3 ligase TOPORS are central mediators of decitabine cytotoxicity\nAuthors: Carnie, C. J.; Gotz, M. J.; Palma-Chaundler, C. S.; Weickert, P.; Wanders, A. R.; Serrano-Benitez, A.; Li, H.-Y.; Gupta, V.; Blum, C. J.; Sczaniecka-Clift, M.; Zagnoli-Vieira, G.; D'Alessandro, G.; Richards, S. L.; Gueorguieva, N.; Beli, P.; Stingele, J.; Jackson, S. P.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572728\nThe nucleoside decitabine (5-aza-dC) is used to treat several hematological cancers. Upon triphosphorylation and incorporation into DNA, 5-aza-dC induces covalent DNMT1 DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) and DNA hypomethylation. However, 5-aza-dC treatment success varies, and relapse is common. Using genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we map factors determining 5-aza-dC susceptibility. Unexpectedly, we find that loss of the dCMP deaminase DCTD causes 5-aza-dC resistance, suggesting that 5-aza-dUMP generation underlies most 5-aza-dC cytotoxicity in wild-type cells. Combining results from a subsequent genetic screen in DCTD-deficient cells with identification of the proximal proteome of DNMT1-DPCs, we uncover the ubiquitin/SUMO1 E3 ligase, TOPORS, as a new DPC repair factor. TOPORS is recruited to DNMT1-DPCs in a SUMO-dependent manner and promotes their degradation. Our study suggests that 5-aza-dC-induced DPCs cause cytotoxicity when DPC repair is compromised, while cytotoxicity in wild-type cells arises from perturbed nucleotide metabolism and lays the foundations for the development of predictive biomarkers for decitabine treatment.\nMitochondria-derived nuclear ATP surge protects against confinement-induced proliferation defects\nAuthors: Ghose, R.; Pezzano, F.; Kourtis, S.; Sheraj, I.; Das, S.; Ganez-Zapater, A.; Ghose, U.; Espinar, L.; Parapatics, K.; Venturini, V.; Muller, A. C.; Ruprecht, V.; Sdelci, S.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572417\nThe physical microenvironment regulates cell behaviour. However, whether physical confinement rewires the subcellular localisation of organelles and affect metabolism is unknown. Proteomics analysis revealed that cellular confinement induces a strong enrichment of mitochondrial proteins within the nuclear compartment. High-resolution microscopy confirmed that mechanical cell confinement leads to a rapid re-localisation of mitochondria to the nuclear periphery. This nuclear-mitochondrial proximity is mediated by an endoplasmic reticulum-based net that entraps the mitochondria in an actin-dependent manner. Functionally, the mitochondrial proximity results in a nuclear ATP surge, which can be reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production or via actin depolymerisation. Inhibition of the confinement-derived nuclear ATP surge reveals long-term effects on cell fitness which arise from alterations of chromatin states, delayed DNA damage repair, and impaired cell cycle progression. Together, our data describe a confinement-induced metabolic adaptation that is required to enable prompt DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression by allowing chromatin state transitions.\nLamin B Receptor Upregulation in Metastatic Melanoma Causes Cholesterol-Mediated Nuclear Envelope Fragility\nAuthors: Baird, M. A.; Fischer, R. S.; Jewett, C. E.; Malide, D.; Cartagena-Rivera, A. X.; Waterman, C. M.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572889\nMetastatic cancer cells migrate through regions of tissue confinement, causing nuclear envelope (NE) rupture and heritable DNA damage. We discovered that cells from multiple cancers have increased NE fragility in confinement and transcriptional upregulation of nuclear genes compared to benign counterparts. A bioinformatic-driven siRNA screen revealed that lamin B receptor (LBR) upregulation correlates with melanoma progression and NE fragility. Increased LBR cholesterol synthase activity causes accumulation of cholesterol in the NE, which is necessary and sufficient for nuclear deformability and NE rupture in cells confined in vitro and is associated with NE rupture in invasive cells migrating out of tumor organoids and tumors in vivo. Thus, LBR upregulation causes excess NE cholesterol, driving nuclear fragility in confined migrating melanoma cells, establishing a direct role for nuclear membrane lipid composition in metastatic cancers.\nA Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST) for the high-throughput quantification of senescence-associated markers\nAuthors: Neri, F.; Takajjart, S. N.; Lerner, C. A.; Desprez, P.-Y.; Schilling, B.; Campisi, J.; Gerencser, A. A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573123\nCellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions. Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.\nArtemisinin resistance mutations in Pfcoronin impede hemoglobin uptake\nAuthors: Ullah, I.; Farringer, M. A.; Burkhard, A. Y.; Hathaway, E.; Willett, B. C.; Khushu, M.; Shin, S. H.; Sharma, A. I.; Shao, K. L.; Martin, M. C.; Dvorin, J. D.; Hartl, D. L.; Volkman, S. K.; Bopp, S.; Absalon, S.; Wirth, D. F.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572193\nArtemisinin (ART) combination therapies have been critical in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, but these important drugs are threatened by growing resistance associated with mutations in Pfcoronin and Pfkelch13. Here, we describe the mechanism of Pfcoronin-mediated ART resistance. PfCoronin interacts with PfActin and localizes to membranes of the parasite periphery, the digestive vacuole (DV), and a putative pre-DV compartment (PPDC)--all structures involved in the trafficking of hemoglobin from the RBC for degradation in the DV. Pfcoronin mutations alter PfActin homeostasis and impair the development and morphology of the PPDC. Ultimately, these changes are associated with decreased uptake of red blood cell cytosolic contents by ring-stage Plasmodium falciparum. Previous work has identified decreased hemoglobin uptake as the mechanism of Pfkelch13-mediated ART resistance. This work demonstrates that PfCoronin appears to act via a parallel pathway. For both Pfkelch13-mediated and Pfcoronin-mediated ART resistance, we hypothesize that the decreased hemoglobin uptake in ring stage parasites results in less heme-based activation of the artemisinin endoperoxide ring and reduced cytocidal activity. This study deepens our understanding of ART resistance, as well as hemoglobin uptake and development of the DV in early-stage parasites.\nUnexpected roles for AMPK in suppression of autophagy and reactivation of mTORC1 signaling during prolonged amino acid deprivation\nAuthors: Kazyken, D.; Dame, S. G.; Wang, C.; Wadley, M.; Fingar, D. C.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572593\nAmino acid withdrawal suppresses mTORC1 signaling rapidly, which initiates macroautophagy (herein, autophagy). Prolonged amino acid deprivation, however, leads to partial reactivation of mTORC1 due to the liberation of free amino acids by autophagic proteolysis. We observed impaired reactivation of mTORC1 signaling and increased apoptotic cell death upon prolonged amino acid withdrawal in cells lacking the AMPK1/2 catalytic subunits. These findings align well with the role of AMPK in promoting cell survival during energetic stress but oppose the well-documented inhibitory action of AMPK toward mTORC1. AMPK-mediated reactivation of mTORC1 during prolonged amino acid deprivation could be explained, however, if AMPK were required for autophagy. Indeed, a prevailing view posits that activation of AMPK by glucose withdrawal promotes autophagy and mitophagy through multisite phosphorylation of ULK1. When we examined the role of AMPK in autophagy induced by amino acid deprivation, however, we found unexpectedly that autophagy remained unimpaired in cells lacking AMPK 1/2, as monitored by several autophagic readouts in several cell lines. Moreover, the absence of AMPK increased ULK1 signaling, LC3b lipidation, and lysosomal acidity, and the phosphorylation of ULK1 S555 (an AMPK site proposed to induce autophagy) decreased upon amino acid withdrawal or pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition. In addition, activation of AMPK with compound 991, glucose deprivation, or AICAR blunted basal and amino acid withdrawal-induced autophagy. Together our results demonstrate that AMPK suppresses rather than promotes autophagy and supports mTORC1 signaling during prolonged amino acid deprivation, revealing unexpected roles for AMPK in control of these processes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Defining the subcellular distribution of all human proteins and its remodeling across cellular states remains a central goal in cell biology. Here, we present a high-resolution strategy to map subcellular organization using organelle immuno-capture coupled to mass spectrometry. We apply this proteomics workflow to a cell-wide collection of membranous and membrane-less compartments. A graph-based representation of our data reveals the subcellular localization of over 7,600 proteins, defines spatial protein networks, and uncovers interconnections between cellular compartments. We demonstrate that our approach can be deployed to comprehensively profile proteome remodeling during cellular perturbation. By characterizing the cellular landscape following hCoV-OC43 viral infection, we discover that many proteins are regulated by changes in their spatial distribution rather than by changes in their total abundance. Our results establish that proteome-wide analysis of subcellular remodeling provides essential insights for the elucidation of cellular responses. Our dataset can be explored at organelles.czbiohub.org.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High-throughput dynamic imaging of cells and organelles is important for parsing complex cellular responses. We report a high-throughput 4D microscope, named Mantis, that combines two complementary, gentle, live-imaging technologies: remote-refocus label-free microscopy and oblique light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We also report open-source software for automated acquisition, registration, and reconstruction, and virtual staining software for single-cell segmentation and phenotyping. Mantis enabled high-content correlative imaging of molecular components and the physical architecture of 20 cell lines every 15 minutes over 7.5 hours, and also detailed measurements of the impacts of viral infection on the architecture of host cells and host proteins. The Mantis platform can enable high-throughput profiling of intracellular dynamics, long-term imaging and analysis of cellular responses to stress, and live cell optical screens to dissect gene regulatory networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuronal clathrin-mediated endocytosis has unique features in compartments such as dendrites and presynaptic boutons, but how membrane and extracellular components are internalized along the axon shaft remains poorly known. Here we focused on clathrin-coated structures and endocytosis along the axon initial segment (AIS), and their relationship to the periodic actin-spectrin scaffold that lines the axonal plasma membrane. Super-resolution optical microscopy, platinum replica electron microscopy, and their correlative combination on cultured hippocampal neurons reveal that in the AIS, clathrin-coated pits form on bare membrane patches, [~]300 nm circular areas devoid of spectrin mesh and lined by actin filaments we termed &#34;clearings&#34;. In fibroblasts and the proximal axon of neurons, spectrin depletion and drug-induced scaffold disorganization increase clathrin-coated pit formation. However, the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the AIS is not directly linked to actual endocytosis: using cargo uptake and live-cell imaging experiments, we find that most AIS clathrin-coated pits are long-lived and immobile within the spectrin mesh clearings. Direct perturbation of the spectrin scaffold as well as elevated neuronal activity could induce endocytosis downstream of clathrin pit formation, showing that spectrin clearings are structures responsible for regulated endocytosis at the AIS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The movements that give rise to the bodys structure are powered by cell shape changes and rearrangements that are coordinated at supracellular scales. How such cellular coordination arises and integrates different morphogenetic programs is unclear. Using quantitative imaging, we found a complex pattern of adherens junction (AJ) levels in the ectoderm prior to gastrulation onset in Drosophila. AJ intensity exhibited a double- sided gradient, with peaks at the dorsal midline and ventral neuroectoderm. We show that this dorsal-ventral AJ pattern is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and that this signal is required for ectoderm cell movement during mesoderm invagination and axis extension. We identify AJ levels and junctional actomyosin as downstream effectors of EGFR signaling. Overall, our study demonstrates a mechanism of coordination between tissue folding and convergent extension that facilitates embryo-wide gastrulation movements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The nucleoside decitabine (5-aza-dC) is used to treat several hematological cancers. Upon triphosphorylation and incorporation into DNA, 5-aza-dC induces covalent DNMT1 DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) and DNA hypomethylation. However, 5-aza-dC treatment success varies, and relapse is common. Using genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we map factors determining 5-aza-dC susceptibility. Unexpectedly, we find that loss of the dCMP deaminase DCTD causes 5-aza-dC resistance, suggesting that 5-aza-dUMP generation underlies most 5-aza-dC cytotoxicity in wild-type cells. Combining results from a subsequent genetic screen in DCTD-deficient cells with identification of the proximal proteome of DNMT1-DPCs, we uncover the ubiquitin/SUMO1 E3 ligase, TOPORS, as a new DPC repair factor. TOPORS is recruited to DNMT1-DPCs in a SUMO-dependent manner and promotes their degradation. Our study suggests that 5-aza-dC-induced DPCs cause cytotoxicity when DPC repair is compromised, while cytotoxicity in wild-type cells arises from perturbed nucleotide metabolism and lays the foundations for the development of predictive biomarkers for decitabine treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The physical microenvironment regulates cell behaviour. However, whether physical confinement rewires the subcellular localisation of organelles and affect metabolism is unknown. Proteomics analysis revealed that cellular confinement induces a strong enrichment of mitochondrial proteins within the nuclear compartment. High-resolution microscopy confirmed that mechanical cell confinement leads to a rapid re-localisation of mitochondria to the nuclear periphery. This nuclear-mitochondrial proximity is mediated by an endoplasmic reticulum-based net that entraps the mitochondria in an actin-dependent manner. Functionally, the mitochondrial proximity results in a nuclear ATP surge, which can be reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production or via actin depolymerisation. Inhibition of the confinement-derived nuclear ATP surge reveals long-term effects on cell fitness which arise from alterations of chromatin states, delayed DNA damage repair, and impaired cell cycle progression. Together, our data describe a confinement-induced metabolic adaptation that is required to enable prompt DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression by allowing chromatin state transitions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metastatic cancer cells migrate through regions of tissue confinement, causing nuclear envelope (NE) rupture and heritable DNA damage. We discovered that cells from multiple cancers have increased NE fragility in confinement and transcriptional upregulation of nuclear genes compared to benign counterparts. A bioinformatic-driven siRNA screen revealed that lamin B receptor (LBR) upregulation correlates with melanoma progression and NE fragility. Increased LBR cholesterol synthase activity causes accumulation of cholesterol in the NE, which is necessary and sufficient for nuclear deformability and NE rupture in cells confined in vitro and is associated with NE rupture in invasive cells migrating out of tumor organoids and tumors in vivo. Thus, LBR upregulation causes excess NE cholesterol, driving nuclear fragility in confined migrating melanoma cells, establishing a direct role for nuclear membrane lipid composition in metastatic cancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions. Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Artemisinin (ART) combination therapies have been critical in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, but these important drugs are threatened by growing resistance associated with mutations in Pfcoronin and Pfkelch13. Here, we describe the mechanism of Pfcoronin-mediated ART resistance. PfCoronin interacts with PfActin and localizes to membranes of the parasite periphery, the digestive vacuole (DV), and a putative pre-DV compartment (PPDC)--all structures involved in the trafficking of hemoglobin from the RBC for degradation in the DV. Pfcoronin mutations alter PfActin homeostasis and impair the development and morphology of the PPDC. Ultimately, these changes are associated with decreased uptake of red blood cell cytosolic contents by ring-stage Plasmodium falciparum. Previous work has identified decreased hemoglobin uptake as the mechanism of Pfkelch13-mediated ART resistance. This work demonstrates that PfCoronin appears to act via a parallel pathway. For both Pfkelch13-mediated and Pfcoronin-mediated ART resistance, we hypothesize that the decreased hemoglobin uptake in ring stage parasites results in less heme-based activation of the artemisinin endoperoxide ring and reduced cytocidal activity. This study deepens our understanding of ART resistance, as well as hemoglobin uptake and development of the DV in early-stage parasites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Amino acid withdrawal suppresses mTORC1 signaling rapidly, which initiates macroautophagy (herein, autophagy). Prolonged amino acid deprivation, however, leads to partial reactivation of mTORC1 due to the liberation of free amino acids by autophagic proteolysis. We observed impaired reactivation of mTORC1 signaling and increased apoptotic cell death upon prolonged amino acid withdrawal in cells lacking the AMPK1/2 catalytic subunits. These findings align well with the role of AMPK in promoting cell survival during energetic stress but oppose the well-documented inhibitory action of AMPK toward mTORC1. AMPK-mediated reactivation of mTORC1 during prolonged amino acid deprivation could be explained, however, if AMPK were required for autophagy. Indeed, a prevailing view posits that activation of AMPK by glucose withdrawal promotes autophagy and mitophagy through multisite phosphorylation of ULK1. When we examined the role of AMPK in autophagy induced by amino acid deprivation, however, we found unexpectedly that autophagy remained unimpaired in cells lacking AMPK 1/2, as monitored by several autophagic readouts in several cell lines. Moreover, the absence of AMPK increased ULK1 signaling, LC3b lipidation, and lysosomal acidity, and the phosphorylation of ULK1 S555 (an AMPK site proposed to induce autophagy) decreased upon amino acid withdrawal or pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition. In addition, activation of AMPK with compound 991, glucose deprivation, or AICAR blunted basal and amino acid withdrawal-induced autophagy. Together our results demonstrate that AMPK suppresses rather than promotes autophagy and supports mTORC1 signaling during prolonged amino acid deprivation, revealing unexpected roles for AMPK in control of these processes.</p>
