S.\nScore: 31.5, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.550032\nChromatin architecture is a fundamental mediator of genome function. Fasting is a major environmental cue across the animal kingdom. Yet, how it impacts on 3D genome organization is unknown. Here, we show that fasting induces a reversible and large-scale spatial reorganization of chromatin in C. elegans. This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of transcription by RNA Pol I, but not RNA Pol II nor Pol III, induces a similar 3D genome reorganization in fed animals, and prevents the restoration of the fed-state architecture upon restoring nutrients to fasted animals. Our work documents the first large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.\nGeneration of an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a healthy adult indigenous Nigerian participant\nAuthors: Muhammad, Z.; Brown, P.

B.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550059\nGenetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.\nA signalling rheostat controls chromosome segregation fidelity during early lineage specification and neurogenesis by modulating DNA replication stress\nAuthors: de Jaime Soguero, A.; Hattemer, J.; Haas, A.; Bufe, A.; Di Marco, B.; Bohly, N.; Landry, J. J. M.; Schoell, B.; Rosa, V. S.; Villacorta, L.; Baskan, Y.; Androulaki, S.; Trapp, M.; Benes, V.; Das, B.; Shahbazi, M.; Jauch, A.; Engel, U.; Patrizi, A.; Sotillo, R.; Bageritz, J.; Alfonso, J.; Bastians, H.; Acebron, S. P.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549463\nThe development and homeostasis of organisms rely on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of their genetic blueprints. How these intracellular processes are monitored across generations of different human cellular lineages, and why the spatio-temporal distribution of mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Here, we identify several lineage specification signals that regulate chromosome segregation fidelity in both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. Through epistatic analyses, we find that that WNT, BMP and FGF form a signalling \"rheostat\" upstream of ATM that monitors replication fork velocity, origin firing and DNA damage during S-phase in pluripotency, which in turn controls spindle polymerisation dynamics and faithful chromosome segregation in the following mitosis. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation fidelity declines together with ATM activity after pluripotency exit and specification into the three human germ layers, or further differentiation into meso- and endoderm lineages, but re-emerges during neuronal lineage specification. In particular, we reveal that a tug-of-war between FGF and WNT signalling in neural progenitor cells results in DNA damage and chromosome missegregation during cortical neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the high levels of mosaicism in the human brain. Our results highlight a moonlighting role of morphogens, patterning signals and growth factors in genome maintenance during pluripotency and lineage specification, which could have important implications for our understanding on how mutations and aneuploidy arise during human development and disease.

D.; Wang, S.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550157\nAlterations in three-dimensional (3D) genome structures are associated with cancer1-5. However, how genome folding evolves and diversifies during subclonal cancer progression in the native tissue environment remains unknown. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide chromatin tracing technology to directly visualize 3D genome folding in situ in a faithful Kras-driven mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)6, generating the first single-cell 3D genome atlas of any cancer. We discovered stereotypical 3D genome alterations during cancer development, including a striking structural bottleneck in preinvasive adenomas prior to progression to LUAD, indicating a stringent selection on the 3D genome early in cancer progression. We further showed that the 3D genome precisely encodes cancer states in single cells, despite considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Finally, evolutionary changes in 3D genome compartmentalization - partially regulated by polycomb group protein Rnf2 through its ubiquitin ligase-independent activity - reveal novel genetic drivers and suppressors of LUAD progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of mapping the single-cell cancer 3D genome and the potential to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers from 3D genomic architectures.\nLuminal transport rates through intact endoplasmic reticulum limit the magnitude of localized Ca2+ signals\nAuthors: Crapart, C.; Scott, Z. C.; Konno, T.; Sharma, A.; Bailey, D. M.; Avezov, E.; Koslover, E. F.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546357\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an interconnected network of tubules stretching throughout the cell. Understanding how ER functionality relies on its structural organization is crucial for elucidating cellular vulnerability to ER perturbations, which have been implicated in several neuronal pathologies. One of the key functions of the ER is enabling Ca2+ signalling by storing large quantities of this ion and releasing it into the cytoplasm in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Through a combination of physical modeling and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that alterations in ER shape significantly impact its ability to support efficient local Ca2+ releases, due to hindered transport of luminal content within the ER. Our model reveals that rapid Ca2+ release necessitates mobile luminal buffer proteins with moderate binding strength, moving through a well-connected network of ER tubules. These findings provide insight into the functional advantages of normal ER architecture, emphasizing its importance as a kinetically efficient intracellular Ca2+ delivery system. I. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCells make use of Ca2+ ions to transfer information and regulate many cell functions. By modulating Ca2+ levels, timing, and location in the cytosol, cells can encode a wide diversity of signals with this single ion. The ER constitutes a major intracellular Ca2+ store, extending throughout the entire cell as a network of tubules through which Ca2+ ions and Ca2+-binding buffer proteins can move. This work demonstrates that mobile buffer proteins and a well-connected lattice-like architecture of the ER network are optimal to supply local Ca2+ signals and that changes in ER structure can modulate Ca2+ release. Consequently, a key structure-function link is suggested for the ER network, relying on its performance as an intracellular transport system for bioactive material.\nTepsin binds LC3B to promote ATG9A export and delivery at the cell periphery\nAuthors: Wallace, N. S.; Gadbery, J. E.; Cohen, C. I.; Kendall, A. K.; Jackson, L. P.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549521\nTepsin is an established accessory protein found in Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) coated vesicles, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. AP-4 vesicles originate at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and target the delivery of ATG9A, a scramblase required for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. Using in silico methods, we identified a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif in tepsin. Biochemical experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicate tepsin directly binds LC3B, but not other members, of the mammalian ATG8 family. Calorimetry and structural modeling data indicate this interaction occurs with micromolar affinity using the established LC3B LIR docking site. Loss of tepsin in cultured cells dysregulates ATG9A export from the TGN as well as ATG9A distribution at the cell periphery. Tepsin depletion in a mRFP-GFP-LC3B HeLa reporter cell line using siRNA knockdown increases autophagosome volume and number, but does not appear to affect flux through the autophagic pathway. Re-introduction of wild-type tepsin partially rescues ATG9A cargo trafficking defects. In contrast, re-introducing tepsin with a mutated LIR motif or missing N-terminus does not fully rescue altered ATG9A subcellular distribution. Together, these data suggest roles for tepsin in cargo export from the TGN; delivery of ATG9A-positive vesicles at the cell periphery; and in overall maintenance of autophagosome structure.\nMiniBAR/KIAA0355 is a dual Rac and Rab effector required for ciliogenesis\nAuthors: Shaughnessy, R.; Serres, M.; Escot, S.; Hammich, H.; Cuvelier, F.; Salles, A.; Rocancourt, M.; Verdon, Q.; Gaffuri, A.-L.; Sourigues, Y.; Malherbe, G.; Velikovsky, L.; Chardon, F.; Tinevez, J.-Y.; Callebaut, I.; Formstecher, E.; Houdusse, A.; David, N.; Pylypenko, O.; Echard, A.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550339\nCilia protrude from the cell surface and play critical roles in intracellular signaling, environmental sensing and development. Actin-dependent contractility and intracellular trafficking are both required for ciliogenesis, but little is known about how these processes are coordinated. Here, we identified a Rac1- and Rab35-binding protein with a truncated BAR domain that we named MiniBAR (aka KIAA0355/GARRE) which plays a key role in ciliogenesis. MiniBAR colocalizes with Rac1 and Rab35 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles trafficking to the ciliary base and exhibits remarkable fast pulses at the ciliary membrane. MiniBAR depletion leads to short cilia resulting from abnormal Rac-GTP/Rho-GTP levels, increased acto-myosin-II-dependent contractility together with defective trafficking of IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia. MiniBAR-depleted zebrafish embryos display dysfunctional short cilia and hallmarks of ciliopathies including left-right asymmetry defects. Thus, MiniBAR is a unique dual Rac and Rab effector that controls both actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking for ciliogenesis.\nThree-step docking by WIPI2, ATG16L1 and ATG3 delivers LC3 to the phagophore\nAuthors: Rao, S.; Strong, L. M.; Ren, X.; Skulsuppaisarn, M.; Lazarou, M.; Hurley, J. H.; Hummer, G.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549391\nThe covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.\nCdc42 mobility and membrane flows regulate fission yeast cell shape and survival\nAuthors: Rutkowski, D. M.; Vincenzetti, V.; Vavylonis, D.; Martin, S. G.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550042\nLocal Cdc42 GTPase activation promotes polarized exocytosis, resulting in membrane flows that deplete low-mobility membrane-associated proteins from the growth region. To investigate the self-organizing properties of the Cdc42 secretion-polarization system under membrane flow, we developed a reaction-diffusion particle model. The model includes positive feedback activation of Cdc42, hydrolysis by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and flow-induced displacement by exo/endocytosis. Simulations show how polarization relies on flow-induced depletion of low mobility GAPs. To probe the role of Cdc42 mobility in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we changed its membrane binding properties by replacing its prenylation site with 1, 2 or 3 repeats of the Rit1 C terminal membrane binding domain (ritC), yielding alleles with progressively lower unbinding and diffusion rates. Concordant modelling predictions and experimental observations show that lower Cdc42 mobility results in lower Cdc42 activation level and wider patches. Indeed, while Cdc42-1ritC cells are viable and polarized, Cdc42-2ritC polarize poorly and Cdc42-3ritC is inviable. The model further predicts that GAP depletion increases Cdc42 activity at the expense of loss of polarization. Experiments confirm this prediction, as deletion of Cdc42 GAPs restores viability to Cdc42-3ritC cells. Our combined experimental and modelling studies demonstrate how membrane flows are an integral part of Cdc42-driven pattern formation. Significance StatementThe delivery of new membrane from internal pools at zones of polarized secretion induces in-plane plasma membrane flows that displace slowly mobile membrane-associated proteins from the zone of secretion. However, zones of polarized secretion are themselves specified by the activity of membrane-associated polarity factors, such as the small GTPase Cdc42. Through combined modelling and experimental approaches, this work demonstrates that the fast mobility of the Cdc42 GTPase is critical to allow the establishment and maintenance of a polarity patch, which is reinforced by flow-mediated displacement of a negative regulator.\nThe cellular landscape of the endochondral bone highlights its multipotent and immunomodulatory features during the transition to extrauterine life\nAuthors: Rueda, A. D.; Salvador-Martinez, I.; Sospedra-Arrufat, I.; Alcaina-Caro, A.; Fernandez-Minan, A.; Burgos-Ruiz, A. M.; Cases, I.; Mohedano, A.; Tena, J.

While the adult bone has received significant attention, we still lack a deep understanding of the perinatal bone cellulome. Here, we have profiled the full composition of the murine endochondral bone at the single-cell level during the transition from fetal to newborn life and in comparison to the adult organ, with particular emphasis on the mesenchymal compartment. The perinatal bone contains different fibroblastic clusters with blastema-like characteristics in organizing and supporting skeletogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Our data also points out to a dynamic inter- and intra-compartment interactions as well as a bone marrow milieu prone to anti-inflammation, which we hypothesize is necessary to ensure the proper program of lymphopoiesis and the establishment of central and peripheral tolerance in early life. Our study provides a integrative roadmap for the future design of genetic and cellular functional assays to validate cellular interactions and lineage relationships within the perinatal bone.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chromatin architecture is a fundamental mediator of genome function. Fasting is a major environmental cue across the animal kingdom. Yet, how it impacts on 3D genome organization is unknown. Here, we show that fasting induces a reversible and large-scale spatial reorganization of chromatin in C. elegans. This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of transcription by RNA Pol I, but not RNA Pol II nor Pol III, induces a similar 3D genome reorganization in fed animals, and prevents the restoration of the fed-state architecture upon restoring nutrients to fasted animals.

Our work documents the first large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development and homeostasis of organisms rely on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of their genetic blueprints. How these intracellular processes are monitored across generations of different human cellular lineages, and why the spatio-temporal distribution of mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Here, we identify several lineage specification signals that regulate chromosome segregation fidelity in both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. Through epistatic analyses, we find that that WNT, BMP and FGF form a signalling &#34;rheostat&#34; upstream of ATM that monitors replication fork velocity, origin firing and DNA damage during S-phase in pluripotency, which in turn controls spindle polymerisation dynamics and faithful chromosome segregation in the following mitosis. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation fidelity declines together with ATM activity after pluripotency exit and specification into the three human germ layers, or further differentiation into meso- and endoderm lineages, but re-emerges during neuronal lineage specification. In particular, we reveal that a tug-of-war between FGF and WNT signalling in neural progenitor cells results in DNA damage and chromosome missegregation during cortical neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the high levels of mosaicism in the human brain. Our results highlight a moonlighting role of morphogens, patterning signals and growth factors in genome maintenance during pluripotency and lineage specification, which could have important implications for our understanding on how mutations and aneuploidy arise during human development and disease.

        <p class="abstract">Alterations in three-dimensional (3D) genome structures are associated with cancer1-5. However, how genome folding evolves and diversifies during subclonal cancer progression in the native tissue environment remains unknown. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide chromatin tracing technology to directly visualize 3D genome folding in situ in a faithful Kras-driven mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)6, generating the first single-cell 3D genome atlas of any cancer. We discovered stereotypical 3D genome alterations during cancer development, including a striking structural bottleneck in preinvasive adenomas prior to progression to LUAD, indicating a stringent selection on the 3D genome early in cancer progression. We further showed that the 3D genome precisely encodes cancer states in single cells, despite considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Finally, evolutionary changes in 3D genome compartmentalization - partially regulated by polycomb group protein Rnf2 through its ubiquitin ligase-independent activity - reveal novel genetic drivers and suppressors of LUAD progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of mapping the single-cell cancer 3D genome and the potential to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers from 3D genomic architectures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an interconnected network of tubules stretching throughout the cell. Understanding how ER functionality relies on its structural organization is crucial for elucidating cellular vulnerability to ER perturbations, which have been implicated in several neuronal pathologies. One of the key functions of the ER is enabling Ca2&#43; signalling by storing large quantities of this ion and releasing it into the cytoplasm in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Through a combination of physical modeling and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that alterations in ER shape significantly impact its ability to support efficient local Ca2&#43; releases, due to hindered transport of luminal content within the ER. Our model reveals that rapid Ca2&#43; release necessitates mobile luminal buffer proteins with moderate binding strength, moving through a well-connected network of ER tubules. These findings provide insight into the functional advantages of normal ER architecture, emphasizing its importance as a kinetically efficient intracellular Ca2&#43; delivery system.

I. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCells make use of Ca2&#43; ions to transfer information and regulate many cell functions. By modulating Ca2&#43; levels, timing, and location in the cytosol, cells can encode a wide diversity of signals with this single ion. The ER constitutes a major intracellular Ca2&#43; store, extending throughout the entire cell as a network of tubules through which Ca2&#43; ions and Ca2&#43;-binding buffer proteins can move. This work demonstrates that mobile buffer proteins and a well-connected lattice-like architecture of the ER network are optimal to supply local Ca2&#43; signals and that changes in ER structure can modulate Ca2&#43; release. Consequently, a key structure-function link is suggested for the ER network, relying on its performance as an intracellular transport system for bioactive material.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tepsin is an established accessory protein found in Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) coated vesicles, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. AP-4 vesicles originate at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and target the delivery of ATG9A, a scramblase required for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. Using in silico methods, we identified a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif in tepsin. Biochemical experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicate tepsin directly binds LC3B, but not other members, of the mammalian ATG8 family. Calorimetry and structural modeling data indicate this interaction occurs with micromolar affinity using the established LC3B LIR docking site. Loss of tepsin in cultured cells dysregulates ATG9A export from the TGN as well as ATG9A distribution at the cell periphery. Tepsin depletion in a mRFP-GFP-LC3B HeLa reporter cell line using siRNA knockdown increases autophagosome volume and number, but does not appear to affect flux through the autophagic pathway. Re-introduction of wild-type tepsin partially rescues ATG9A cargo trafficking defects. In contrast, re-introducing tepsin with a mutated LIR motif or missing N-terminus does not fully rescue altered ATG9A subcellular distribution. Together, these data suggest roles for tepsin in cargo export from the TGN; delivery of ATG9A-positive vesicles at the cell periphery; and in overall maintenance of autophagosome structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cilia protrude from the cell surface and play critical roles in intracellular signaling, environmental sensing and development. Actin-dependent contractility and intracellular trafficking are both required for ciliogenesis, but little is known about how these processes are coordinated. Here, we identified a Rac1- and Rab35-binding protein with a truncated BAR domain that we named MiniBAR (aka KIAA0355/GARRE) which plays a key role in ciliogenesis. MiniBAR colocalizes with Rac1 and Rab35 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles trafficking to the ciliary base and exhibits remarkable fast pulses at the ciliary membrane. MiniBAR depletion leads to short cilia resulting from abnormal Rac-GTP/Rho-GTP levels, increased acto-myosin-II-dependent contractility together with defective trafficking of IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia. MiniBAR-depleted zebrafish embryos display dysfunctional short cilia and hallmarks of ciliopathies including left-right asymmetry defects. Thus, MiniBAR is a unique dual Rac and Rab effector that controls both actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking for ciliogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Local Cdc42 GTPase activation promotes polarized exocytosis, resulting in membrane flows that deplete low-mobility membrane-associated proteins from the growth region. To investigate the self-organizing properties of the Cdc42 secretion-polarization system under membrane flow, we developed a reaction-diffusion particle model. The model includes positive feedback activation of Cdc42, hydrolysis by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and flow-induced displacement by exo/endocytosis. Simulations show how polarization relies on flow-induced depletion of low mobility GAPs. To probe the role of Cdc42 mobility in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we changed its membrane binding properties by replacing its prenylation site with 1, 2 or 3 repeats of the Rit1 C terminal membrane binding domain (ritC), yielding alleles with progressively lower unbinding and diffusion rates. Concordant modelling predictions and experimental observations show that lower Cdc42 mobility results in lower Cdc42 activation level and wider patches. Indeed, while Cdc42-1ritC cells are viable and polarized, Cdc42-2ritC polarize poorly and Cdc42-3ritC is inviable. The model further predicts that GAP depletion increases Cdc42 activity at the expense of loss of polarization. Experiments confirm this prediction, as deletion of Cdc42 GAPs restores viability to Cdc42-3ritC cells. Our combined experimental and modelling studies demonstrate how membrane flows are an integral part of Cdc42-driven pattern formation.

Significance StatementThe delivery of new membrane from internal pools at zones of polarized secretion induces in-plane plasma membrane flows that displace slowly mobile membrane-associated proteins from the zone of secretion. However, zones of polarized secretion are themselves specified by the activity of membrane-associated polarity factors, such as the small GTPase Cdc42. Through combined modelling and experimental approaches, this work demonstrates that the fast mobility of the Cdc42 GTPase is critical to allow the establishment and maintenance of a polarity patch, which is reinforced by flow-mediated displacement of a negative regulator.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cellular complexity of the endochondral bone underlies its essential and pleiotropic roles during organismal life. While the adult bone has received significant attention, we still lack a deep understanding of the perinatal bone cellulome. Here, we have profiled the full composition of the murine endochondral bone at the single-cell level during the transition from fetal to newborn life and in comparison to the adult organ, with particular emphasis on the mesenchymal compartment. The perinatal bone contains different fibroblastic clusters with blastema-like characteristics in organizing and supporting skeletogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Our data also points out to a dynamic inter- and intra-compartment interactions as well as a bone marrow milieu prone to anti-inflammation, which we hypothesize is necessary to ensure the proper program of lymphopoiesis and the establishment of central and peripheral tolerance in early life. Our study provides a integrative roadmap for the future design of genetic and cellular functional assays to validate cellular interactions and lineage relationships within the perinatal bone.</p>
