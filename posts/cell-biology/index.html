Diatoms perform up to 20% of global CO2 fixation, but their pyrenoids remain poorly characterized at a molecular level. Here, we used in vivo photo-crosslinking to catalogue components of diatom pyrenoids and identified a pyrenoid shell (PyShell) protein, which we localized to the pyrenoid periphery of both the pennate diatom, Pheaodactylum tricornutum, and the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. In situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) revealed that the pyrenoids of both diatom species are encased in a lattice-like protein sheath. Disruption of PyShell expression in T. pseudonana resulted in the absence of this protein sheath, altered pyrenoid morphology, and a high-CO2 requiring phenotype, with impaired growth and reduced carbon fixation efficiency under standard atmospheric conditions. Pyrenoids in mutant cells were fragmented and lacked the thylakoid membranes that normally traverse the Rubisco matrix, demonstrating how the PyShell plays a guiding role in establishing pyrenoid architecture. Recombinant PyShell proteins self-assembled into helical tubes, enabling us to determine a 3.0 [A]-resolution PyShell structure. We then fit this in vitro structure into an in situ subtomogram average of the pyrenoid's protein sheath, yielding a putative atomic model of the PyShell within diatom cells. The structure and function of the diatom PyShell provides a new molecular view of how CO2 is assimilated in the ocean, a crucial biome that is on the front lines of climate change.\nSpindle architecture constrains karyotype in budding yeast\nAuthors: Helsen, J.; Reza, M. H.; Sherlock, G. J.; Dey, G.\nScore: 37.6, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563899\nThe eukaryotic cell division machinery must rapidly and reproducibly duplicate and partition the cells chromosomes in a carefully coordinated process. However, chromosome number varies dramatically between genomes, even on short evolutionary timescales. We sought to understand how the mitotic machinery senses and responds to karyotypic changes by using a set of budding yeast strains in which the native chromosomes have been successively fused. Using a combination of cell biological profiling, genetic engineering, and experimental evolution, we show that chromosome fusions are well tolerated up until a critical point. However, with fewer than five centromeres, outward forces in the metaphase spindle cannot be countered by kinetochore-microtubule attachments, triggering mitotic defects. Our findings demonstrate that spindle architecture is a constraining factor for karyotype evolution.\nFailed reprogramming of transformed cells due to induction of apoptosis and senescence impairs tumor progression in lung cancer\nAuthors: Pedrosa, P.; Zang, Z.; Macias, D.; Ge, J.; Denholm, M.; Dyas, A.; Nunez-Quintela, V.; Estevez-Souto, V.; Lado-Fernandez, P.; Gonzalez, P.; Gomez, M.; Martin, J. E.; Da Silva-Alvarez, S.; Munoz-Espin, D.; Collado, M.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563086\nCell reprogramming to pluripotency applied to the study of cancer has identified transformation and pluripotency as two independent and incompatible cell fates. A detailed knowledge of the relationship between transformation and reprogramming could lead to the identification of new vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we explore this interplay and find that OSKM expression limits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and senescence. We identify Oct4 and Klf4 as the main individual reprogramming factors responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, the induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21 downstream of the reprogramming factors acts as mediator of cell death and senescence. Using a variety of in vivo systems, including allografts, orthotopic transplantation and KRAS-driven lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that OSKM expression impairs tumor growth and reduces tumor burden.\nNanoscale imaging reveals the mechanisms of ER-to-Golgi transport via a dynamic tubular-vesicular network\nAuthors: Wong-Dilworth, L.; Bregu, G.; Restel, S.; Rodilla-Ramirez, C.; Ebeling, S.; Harel, S.; Leupold, P.; Grimm, J.; Lavis, L.; Bottanelli, F.; Angulo-Capel, J.; Campelo, F.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.563951\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus are the first sorting stations along the secretory pathway of mammalian cells and have a crucial role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. While machinery components mediating ER-to-Golgi transport have been mapped, it is unclear how exchange between the two closely juxtaposed organelles is coordinated in living cells. Here, using gene editing to tag machinery components, live-cell confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy, we show that ER-to-Golgi transport occurs via a dynamic network of tubules positive for the small GTPase ARF4. COPI machinery is tightly associated to this network and moves with tubular-vesicular structures. Strikingly, the ARF4 network appears to be continuous with the ER and ARF4 tubules remodel around static ER exit sites (ERES) defined by COPII machinery. We were further able to dissect the steps of ER-to-Golgi transport with functional trafficking assays. A wave of cargo released from the ER percolates through peripheral and Golgi-tethered ARF4 structures before filling the cis-Golgi. Perturbation via acute degradation of ARF4 shows an active regulatory role for the GTPase and COPI in anterograde transport. Our data supports a model in which anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport occurs via an ARF4 tubular-vesicular network directly connecting the ER and Golgi-associated pre-cisternae.\nA Protein Blueprint of the Diatom CO2-Fixing Organelle\nAuthors: Nam, O.; McKenzie, C.; Dowle, A.; Dowson, M.; Barrett, J.; Mackinder, L.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564148\nDiatoms are central to the global carbon cycle. At the heart of diatom carbon fixation is an overlooked organelle called the pyrenoid, where concentrated CO2 is delivered to densely packed Rubisco. Diatom pyrenoids fix approximately one-fifth of global CO2 but virtually nothing is known about this organelle in diatoms. Using large-scale fluorescence protein tagging and affinity purification-mass spectrometry we generate a high-confidence spatially-defined protein-protein interaction network for the diatom pyrenoid. Within our pyrenoid interactome are 10 proteins with no known function. Six form a static shell encapsulating the Rubisco matrix of the pyrenoid, with the shell critical for pyrenoid structural integrity and potentially acting as a CO2 diffusion barrier. Although no conservation at a sequence level, the diatom pyrenoid shares some structural similarities to prokaryotic carboxysomes. Collectively, our results support the convergent evolution of pyrenoids across the two main plastid lineages and uncovers a major structural and functional component of global CO2 fixation.\nEvaluation of the neutralising antibody response in human and hamster sera against SARS-CoV-2 variants up to and including BA.2.86 using an authentic virus neutralisation assay\nAuthors: Coombes, N. S.; Bewley, K. R.; Le Duff, Y.; Alami-Rahmouni, N.; Ryan, K. A.; Kempster, S.; Ferguson, D.; Davies, E. R.; Weldon, T. M.; Cross, E. S.; Smith, L.; Norris, C.; Rogers-Broadway, K. R.; Lewandowski, K.; Treagus, S.; Pullan, S. T.; Hallis, B.; Charlton, S.; Hall, Y.; Funnell, S. G. P.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563398\nNew vaccines, therapeutics and immunity elicited by natural infection create evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and adapt to evade vaccine-induced and infection-elicited immunity. Vaccine and therapeutics developers thus find themselves in an \"arms race\" with the virus. The ongoing assessment of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants remains essential as the global community transitions from an emergency response to a long-term management plan. Here, we describe how an authentic virus neutralisation assay using low passage clinical virus isolates has been employed to monitor resistance of emerging virus variants to neutralising antibodies from humans and experimentally infected hamsters. Sera and plasma from people who received three doses of a vaccine as well as those who received a bivalent booster were assessed against SARS-CoV-2 variants, up to and including BA.2.86. Contemporary or recent virus variants showed substantial resistance to neutralisation by antibodies from those who had received three vaccines but were still effectively neutralised by antibodies from individuals who had received a bivalent booster (ancestral/BA.1). Convalescent sera from hamsters that had been experimentally infected with one of seven virus variants (ancestral, BA.1, BA.4, BA.5.2.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3) were also tested here. The most contemporary variant, BA.2.86, was effectively neutralised by sera from hamsters infected with XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 but it was not neutralised by sera from those infected with BA.5.2.1. These data support the recommendations given by the WHO that a new vaccine was required and should consist of an XBB sub-lineage antigen.\nER-to-Golgi trafficking via a dynamic intermediate cis-Golgi tubular network in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Fougere, L.; Grison, M.; Laquel, P.; Montrazi, M.; Cordelieres, F.; Fernandez-Monreal, M.; Poujol, C.; Uemura, T.; Nakano, A.; Ito, Y.; Boutte, Y.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.563925\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking is a central process of the secretory system of eukaryotic cells that ensures proper spatiotemporal sorting of proteins and lipids. However, the nature of the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartments (ERGIC) and the molecular mechanisms mediating the transition between the ERGIC and the Golgi, as well as the universality of these processes amongst Eukaryotes, remain undiscovered. Here, we took advantage of the plant cell system in which the Golgi is highly dynamic and in close vicinity to the ER. We discovered that the ERGIC is composed from at least two distinct subpopulations of cis-Golgi. A subpopulation is a reticulated tubulo-vesicular network mostly independent from the Golgi, highly dynamic at the ER-Golgi interface and crossed by ER-induced release of luminal cargos at early stage. Another subpopulation is more stable, cisterna-like and mostly associated to the Golgi. Our results identified that the generation and dynamics of the ER-Golgi intermediate tubulo-vesicular network is regulated by the acyl-chain length of sphingolipids as well as the contacts it establishes with existing Golgi cisternae. Our study is a major twist in the understanding of the Golgi by identifying that the ERGIC in plants is a Golgi-independent highly dynamic tubular network from which arise more stable cisternae-like Golgi structures. This novel model presents a mechanism for early secretory trafficking adapted to respond to developmental and environmental stimuli, including susceptibility or resistance to diseases, autophagy or cell-reprograming.\nMulti-functional ARF1 compartments serve as a hub for short-range cargo transfer to endosomes\nAuthors: Stockhammer, A.; Adarska, P.; Natalia, V.; Heuhsen, A.; Klemt, A.; Harel, S.; Rodilla-Ramirez, C.; Spalt, C.; Oezsoy, E.; Leupold, P.; Grindel, A.; Fox, E.; Mejedo, J. O.; Puchkov, D.; Haucke, V.; Bottanelli, F.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564143\nCellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.\nGenome dilution by cell growth drives starvation-like proteome remodeling in mammalian and yeast cells\nAuthors: Lanz, M. C.; Zhang, S.; Swaffer, M. P.; Hernandez Götz, L.; McCarty, F.; Ziv, I.; Jarosz, D. F.; Elias, J. E.; Skotheim, J. M.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562558\nCell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues and single-celled organisms, but it remains unclear how size influences cell physiology. Increasing cell size was recently shown to remodel the proteomes of cultured human cells, demonstrating that large and small cells of the same type can be biochemically different. Here, we corroborate these results in mouse hepatocytes and extend our analysis using yeast. We find that size-dependent proteome changes are highly conserved and mostly independent of metabolic state. As eukaryotic cells grow larger, the dilution of the genome elicits a starvation-like proteome phenotype, suggesting that growth in large cells is limited by the genome in a manner analogous to a limiting nutrient. We also demonstrate that the proteomes of replicatively-aged yeast are primarily determined by their large size. Overall, our data suggest that genome concentration is a universal determinant of proteome content in growing cells.\nVaccination by single dose sporozoite injection of blood stage attenuated malaria parasites\nAuthors: Sattler, J. M.; Keiber, L.; Abdelrahim, A.; Zheng, X.; Jaecklin, M.; Zechel, L.; Moreau, C. A.; Fischer, M. M.; Janse, C. J.; Hoffmann, A.; Hentzschel, F.; Frischknecht, F.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563045\nAn efficient malaria vaccine remains elusive. As an alternative to malaria subunit vaccines, vaccination approaches are currently explored using live Plasmodium parasites, either attenuated mosquito-derived sporozoites or attenuated blood stage parasites. Both approaches would profit from the availability of attenuated and avirulent parasites with a reduced blood stage multiplication rate. Ideally, such slow growing parasites would proceed normally through the mosquito but cause a self-limiting infection upon transmission. Here we screened gene-deletion mutants of the rodent parasite P. berghei and the human parasite P. falciparum for slow growth. In addition, we tested the P. berghei mutants for avirulence in mice and self-resolving blood stage infections, while preserving sporozoite formation and liver infection. Targeting fifty genes yielded seventeen P. berghei gene-deletion mutants with two mutants causing self-clearing infections in mice while retaining full transmissibility through mosquitoes. For those, infection of mice by a low number of blood stages, infected-mosquito bites or by single injection of sporozoites led to protection from disease after challenge with wild type sporozoites. Two of six generated P. falciparum gene-deletion mutants showed a slow growth rate. Slow growing, avirulent P. falciparum mutants will constitute valuable tools to inform on the induction of immune responses and aid in developing new as well as safeguarding existing attenuated parasite vaccines.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Pyrenoids are subcompartments of algal chloroplasts that concentrate Rubisco enzymes and their CO2 substrate, thereby increasing the efficiency of carbon fixation. Diatoms perform up to 20% of global CO2 fixation, but their pyrenoids remain poorly characterized at a molecular level. Here, we used in vivo photo-crosslinking to catalogue components of diatom pyrenoids and identified a pyrenoid shell (PyShell) protein, which we localized to the pyrenoid periphery of both the pennate diatom, Pheaodactylum tricornutum, and the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. In situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) revealed that the pyrenoids of both diatom species are encased in a lattice-like protein sheath. Disruption of PyShell expression in T. pseudonana resulted in the absence of this protein sheath, altered pyrenoid morphology, and a high-CO2 requiring phenotype, with impaired growth and reduced carbon fixation efficiency under standard atmospheric conditions. Pyrenoids in mutant cells were fragmented and lacked the thylakoid membranes that normally traverse the Rubisco matrix, demonstrating how the PyShell plays a guiding role in establishing pyrenoid architecture. Recombinant PyShell proteins self-assembled into helical tubes, enabling us to determine a 3.0 [A]-resolution PyShell structure. We then fit this in vitro structure into an in situ subtomogram average of the pyrenoid&#39;s protein sheath, yielding a putative atomic model of the PyShell within diatom cells. The structure and function of the diatom PyShell provides a new molecular view of how CO2 is assimilated in the ocean, a crucial biome that is on the front lines of climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The eukaryotic cell division machinery must rapidly and reproducibly duplicate and partition the cells chromosomes in a carefully coordinated process. However, chromosome number varies dramatically between genomes, even on short evolutionary timescales. We sought to understand how the mitotic machinery senses and responds to karyotypic changes by using a set of budding yeast strains in which the native chromosomes have been successively fused. Using a combination of cell biological profiling, genetic engineering, and experimental evolution, we show that chromosome fusions are well tolerated up until a critical point. However, with fewer than five centromeres, outward forces in the metaphase spindle cannot be countered by kinetochore-microtubule attachments, triggering mitotic defects. Our findings demonstrate that spindle architecture is a constraining factor for karyotype evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell reprogramming to pluripotency applied to the study of cancer has identified transformation and pluripotency as two independent and incompatible cell fates. A detailed knowledge of the relationship between transformation and reprogramming could lead to the identification of new vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we explore this interplay and find that OSKM expression limits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and senescence. We identify Oct4 and Klf4 as the main individual reprogramming factors responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, the induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21 downstream of the reprogramming factors acts as mediator of cell death and senescence. Using a variety of in vivo systems, including allografts, orthotopic transplantation and KRAS-driven lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that OSKM expression impairs tumor growth and reduces tumor burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus are the first sorting stations along the secretory pathway of mammalian cells and have a crucial role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. While machinery components mediating ER-to-Golgi transport have been mapped, it is unclear how exchange between the two closely juxtaposed organelles is coordinated in living cells. Here, using gene editing to tag machinery components, live-cell confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy, we show that ER-to-Golgi transport occurs via a dynamic network of tubules positive for the small GTPase ARF4. COPI machinery is tightly associated to this network and moves with tubular-vesicular structures. Strikingly, the ARF4 network appears to be continuous with the ER and ARF4 tubules remodel around static ER exit sites (ERES) defined by COPII machinery. We were further able to dissect the steps of ER-to-Golgi transport with functional trafficking assays. A wave of cargo released from the ER percolates through peripheral and Golgi-tethered ARF4 structures before filling the cis-Golgi. Perturbation via acute degradation of ARF4 shows an active regulatory role for the GTPase and COPI in anterograde transport. Our data supports a model in which anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport occurs via an ARF4 tubular-vesicular network directly connecting the ER and Golgi-associated pre-cisternae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diatoms are central to the global carbon cycle. At the heart of diatom carbon fixation is an overlooked organelle called the pyrenoid, where concentrated CO2 is delivered to densely packed Rubisco. Diatom pyrenoids fix approximately one-fifth of global CO2 but virtually nothing is known about this organelle in diatoms. Using large-scale fluorescence protein tagging and affinity purification-mass spectrometry we generate a high-confidence spatially-defined protein-protein interaction network for the diatom pyrenoid. Within our pyrenoid interactome are 10 proteins with no known function. Six form a static shell encapsulating the Rubisco matrix of the pyrenoid, with the shell critical for pyrenoid structural integrity and potentially acting as a CO2 diffusion barrier. Although no conservation at a sequence level, the diatom pyrenoid shares some structural similarities to prokaryotic carboxysomes. Collectively, our results support the convergent evolution of pyrenoids across the two main plastid lineages and uncovers a major structural and functional component of global CO2 fixation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">New vaccines, therapeutics and immunity elicited by natural infection create evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and adapt to evade vaccine-induced and infection-elicited immunity. Vaccine and therapeutics developers thus find themselves in an &#34;arms race&#34; with the virus. The ongoing assessment of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants remains essential as the global community transitions from an emergency response to a long-term management plan. Here, we describe how an authentic virus neutralisation assay using low passage clinical virus isolates has been employed to monitor resistance of emerging virus variants to neutralising antibodies from humans and experimentally infected hamsters. Sera and plasma from people who received three doses of a vaccine as well as those who received a bivalent booster were assessed against SARS-CoV-2 variants, up to and including BA.2.86. Contemporary or recent virus variants showed substantial resistance to neutralisation by antibodies from those who had received three vaccines but were still effectively neutralised by antibodies from individuals who had received a bivalent booster (ancestral/BA.1). Convalescent sera from hamsters that had been experimentally infected with one of seven virus variants (ancestral, BA.1, BA.4, BA.5.2.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3) were also tested here. The most contemporary variant, BA.2.86, was effectively neutralised by sera from hamsters infected with XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 but it was not neutralised by sera from those infected with BA.5.2.1. These data support the recommendations given by the WHO that a new vaccine was required and should consist of an XBB sub-lineage antigen.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking is a central process of the secretory system of eukaryotic cells that ensures proper spatiotemporal sorting of proteins and lipids. However, the nature of the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartments (ERGIC) and the molecular mechanisms mediating the transition between the ERGIC and the Golgi, as well as the universality of these processes amongst Eukaryotes, remain undiscovered. Here, we took advantage of the plant cell system in which the Golgi is highly dynamic and in close vicinity to the ER. We discovered that the ERGIC is composed from at least two distinct subpopulations of cis-Golgi. A subpopulation is a reticulated tubulo-vesicular network mostly independent from the Golgi, highly dynamic at the ER-Golgi interface and crossed by ER-induced release of luminal cargos at early stage. Another subpopulation is more stable, cisterna-like and mostly associated to the Golgi. Our results identified that the generation and dynamics of the ER-Golgi intermediate tubulo-vesicular network is regulated by the acyl-chain length of sphingolipids as well as the contacts it establishes with existing Golgi cisternae. Our study is a major twist in the understanding of the Golgi by identifying that the ERGIC in plants is a Golgi-independent highly dynamic tubular network from which arise more stable cisternae-like Golgi structures. This novel model presents a mechanism for early secretory trafficking adapted to respond to developmental and environmental stimuli, including susceptibility or resistance to diseases, autophagy or cell-reprograming.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues and single-celled organisms, but it remains unclear how size influences cell physiology. Increasing cell size was recently shown to remodel the proteomes of cultured human cells, demonstrating that large and small cells of the same type can be biochemically different. Here, we corroborate these results in mouse hepatocytes and extend our analysis using yeast. We find that size-dependent proteome changes are highly conserved and mostly independent of metabolic state. As eukaryotic cells grow larger, the dilution of the genome elicits a starvation-like proteome phenotype, suggesting that growth in large cells is limited by the genome in a manner analogous to a limiting nutrient. We also demonstrate that the proteomes of replicatively-aged yeast are primarily determined by their large size. Overall, our data suggest that genome concentration is a universal determinant of proteome content in growing cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An efficient malaria vaccine remains elusive. As an alternative to malaria subunit vaccines, vaccination approaches are currently explored using live Plasmodium parasites, either attenuated mosquito-derived sporozoites or attenuated blood stage parasites. Both approaches would profit from the availability of attenuated and avirulent parasites with a reduced blood stage multiplication rate. Ideally, such slow growing parasites would proceed normally through the mosquito but cause a self-limiting infection upon transmission. Here we screened gene-deletion mutants of the rodent parasite P. berghei and the human parasite P. falciparum for slow growth. In addition, we tested the P. berghei mutants for avirulence in mice and self-resolving blood stage infections, while preserving sporozoite formation and liver infection. Targeting fifty genes yielded seventeen P. berghei gene-deletion mutants with two mutants causing self-clearing infections in mice while retaining full transmissibility through mosquitoes. For those, infection of mice by a low number of blood stages, infected-mosquito bites or by single injection of sporozoites led to protection from disease after challenge with wild type sporozoites. Two of six generated P. falciparum gene-deletion mutants showed a slow growth rate. Slow growing, avirulent P. falciparum mutants will constitute valuable tools to inform on the induction of immune responses and aid in developing new as well as safeguarding existing attenuated parasite vaccines.</p>
