F.; Valon, L.; Roca-Cusachs, P.; Alert, R.; Trepat, X.\nScore: 46.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576733\nThe front of migratory cellular clusters during development, wound healing and cancer invasion is typically populated with highly protrusive cells that are called leader cells. Leader cells are thought to physically pull and direct their cohort of followers, but how leaders and followers are mechanically organized to migrate collectively remains controversial. One possibility is that the autonomous local action of a leader cell is sufficient to drive migration of the group. Yet another possibility is that a global mechanical organization is required for the group to move cohesively. Here we show that the effectiveness of leader-follower organization is proportional to the asymmetry of traction and tension within the cellular cluster. By combining hydrogel micropatterning and optogenetic activation of Rac1, we locally generate highly protrusive leaders at the edge of minimal cell groups. We find that the induced leader can robustly drag one follower but is generally unable to direct larger groups. By measuring traction forces and tension propagation in groups of increasing size, we establish a quantitative relationship between group velocity and the asymmetry of the traction and tension profiles. We propose a model of the motile cluster as an active polar fluid that explains this force-velocity relationship in terms of asymmetries in the distribution of active tractions. Our results challenge the notion of autonomous leader cells by showing that collective cell migration requires a global mechanical organization within the cluster.\nSpatial proteomics of ER tubules reveals CLMN, an ER-actin tether at focal adhesions that promotes cell migration\nAuthors: Merta, H.; Isogai, T.; Paul, B.; Danuser, G.; Henne, W. M.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577043\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is structurally and functionally diverse, yet how its functions are organized within morphological subdomains is incompletely understood. Utilizing TurboID-based proximity labeling and CRISPR knock-in technologies, here we map the proteomic landscape of the human ER and nuclear envelope. Spatial proteomics reveals enrichments of proteins into ER tubules, sheets, and nuclear envelope. We uncover an ER-enriched actin-binding protein, Calmin (CLMN), and define it as an ER-actin tether that localizes to focal adhesions adjacent to ER tubules. CLMN depletion perturbs focal adhesion disassembly, actin dynamics, and cell movement. Mechanistically, CLMN-depleted cells also exhibit defects in calcium signaling near ER-actin interfaces, suggesting CLMN promotes calcium signaling near adhesions to facilitate their disassembly. Collectively, we map the sub-organelle proteome landscape of the ER, identify CLMN as an ER-actin tether, and describe a non-canonical mechanism by which ER tubules engage actin to regulate cell migration.\nIntra-condensate demixing of TDP-43 inside stress granules generates pathological aggregates\nAuthors: Yan, X.; Kuster, D.; Mohanty, P.; Nijssen, J.; Pombo-Garcia, K.; Rizuan, A.; Franzmann, T. M.; Sergeeva, A.; dos Passos, P. M.; George, L.; Wang, S.-H.; Shenoy, J.; Danielson, H. L.; Honigmann, A.; Ayala, Y. M.; Fawzi, N. L.; Mittal, J.; Alberti, S.; Hyman, A. A.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576837\nCytosolic aggregation of the nuclear protein TDP-43 is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, but the triggers for TDP-43 aggregation are still debated. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43 enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transitions into pathological aggregates. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells. We conclude that up-concentration inside condensates and simultaneous exposure to environmental stress could be a general pathway for protein aggregation, with intra-condensate demixing constituting a key intermediate step.\nAn iPSC-derived small intestine-on-chip with self-organizing epithelial, mesenchymal and neural cells\nAuthors: Moerkens, R.; Mooiweer, J.; Ramirez-Sanchez, A. D.; Oelen, R.; Franke, L.; Wijmenga, C.; Barrett, R. J.; Jonkers, I. H.; Withoff, S.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574203\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal organoids are valuable tools for researching developmental biology and personalized therapies, but their closed topology and relative immature state limits their applications. Here we use organ-on-chip technology to develop a hiPSC-derived intestinal barrier with apical and basolateral access in a more physiological in vitro microenvironment. To replicate growth factor gradients along the crypt- villus axis, we locally exposed the cells to expansion and differentiation media. In these conditions, intestinal epithelial cells self-organize into villus-like folds with physiological barrier integrity and myofibroblast and neural subtypes emerge and form a layer in the bottom channel underneath the epithelial tissue. The growth factor gradients efficiently balance dividing and mature cell types and induce an intestinal epithelial composition, including absorptive and secretory lineages, resembling the composition of the human adult small intestine. The result is a well-characterized hiPSC-derived intestine-on-chip system that can facilitate personalized studies on physiological processes and therapy development in the human small intestine.\nHigh-Throughput Identification of Calcium Regulated Proteins Across Diverse Proteomes\nAuthors: Locke, T. M.; Fields, R.; Gizinski, H.; Otto, G. M.; Shechner, D. M.; Berg, M. D.; Villen, J.; Sancak, Y.; Schweppe, D. K.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.575273\nCalcium ions play important roles in nearly every biological process, yet whole-proteome analysis of calcium effectors has been hindered by lack of high-throughput, unbiased, and quantitative methods to identify proteins-calcium engagement. To address this, we adapted protein thermostability assays in the budding yeast, human cells, and mouse mitochondria. Based on calcium-dependent thermostability, we identified 2884 putative calcium-regulated proteins across human, mouse, and yeast proteomes. These data revealed calcium engagement of novel signaling hubs and cellular processes, including metabolic enzymes and the spliceosome. Cross-species comparison of calcium-protein engagement and mutagenesis experiments identified residue-specific cation engagement, even within well-known EF-hand domains. Additionally, we found that the dienoyl-CoA reductase DECR1 binds calcium at physiologically-relevant concentrations with substrate-specific affinity, suggesting direct calcium regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These unbiased, proteomic analyses of calcium effectors establish a key resource to dissect cation engagement and its mechanistic effects across multiple species and diverse biological processes.\nTDP43 aggregation at ER-exit sites impairs ER-to-Golgi transport\nAuthors: Wu, H.; Wang, L. C.; Sow, B.; Leow, D.; Zhu, J.; Gallo, K.; Wilsbach, K.; Gupta, R.; Ostrow, L.; Yeo, C.; Sobota, R.; Li, R.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576891\nProtein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employed a general reporter based on mutant Hsp104 to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. Over 300 proteins were identified, forming different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown solid inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES coaggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delayed ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.\nCLSTN3B enhances adipocyte lipid droplet structure and function via endoplasmic reticulum contact\nAuthors: Zhang, C.; Ye, M.; Melikov, K.; Yang, D.; Dias do Vale, G.; Mcdonald, J.; Eckert, K.; Lin, M.-J.; Zeng, X.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576491\nInterorganelle contacts facilitate material exchanges and sustain the structural and functional integrity of organelles. Lipid droplets (LDs) of adipocytes are responsible for energy storage and mobilization responding to body needs. LD biogenesis defects compromise the lipid-storing capacity of adipocytes, resulting in ectopic lipid deposition and metabolic disorders, yet how the uniquely large LDs in adipocytes attain structural and functional maturation is incompletely understood. Here we show that the mammalian adipocyte-specific protein CLSTN3B is crucial for adipocyte LD maturation. CLSTN3B employs an arginine-rich segment to promote extensive contact and hemifusion-like structure formation between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and LD, allowing ER-to-LD phospholipid diffusion during LD expansion. CLSTN3B ablation results in reduced LD surface phospholipid density, increased turnover of LD-surface proteins, and impaired LD functions. Our results establish the central role of CLSTN3B in the adipocyte-specific LD maturation pathway that enhances lipid storage and maintenance of metabolic health under caloric overload.\nExtracellular matrix signals promotes actin-dependent mitochondrial elongation and activity\nAuthors: Gatti, P.; Mukherjee, P.; Talukdar, P. D.; Freppel, W.; Kanou, J.; Chatel-Chaix, L.; Chatterji, U.; Germain, M.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576703\nMitochondria are crucial metabolic organelles that are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular cues. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key component of the cellular environment that controls cellular behavior and metabolic activity. Here, we determined how ECM signalling regulates mitochondrial structure and activity. To distinguish mitochondrial regulation from the general survival cues generated by the ECM, we used breast cancer-derived spheres (mammospheres) because of their ability to grow in suspension culture in the absence of ECM. Using this system, we demonstrate that the association of mammospheres with the ECM results in dramatic mitochondrial elongation, along with enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. This remodeling occurs independently of DRP1 activity, but relies on integrin signaling and actin polymerization. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ECM-driven actin polymerization plays a crucial role in remodeling mitochondrial networks to promote OXPHOS, which represents a vital step for migrating cells to enhance cellular adhesion and facilitate cell growth.\nAcyltransferases in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis have redundant and non-redundant roles in sn-1 acyl chain regulation, ether lipid levels, and cell survival\nAuthors: Salame, S.; Qasmaoui, H.; Jose, G. P.; Fleuriot, L.; Debayle, D.; Harayama, T.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576130\nThe increased use of lipidomics analyses in biomedical research made it crucial to understand correctly how lipid compositions are regulated. Lipid acyl chains are important regulators of membrane physicochemical properties, and are incorporated by various acyltransferases. The acyltransferases implicated in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis, the GPATs and GNPAT, have distinct localizations and substrate preferences. This suggests that they have distinct roles on lipid regulation, but a complete understanding of their redundant and non-redundant functions is missing. We report here a comprehensive analysis of cells having mutations in GPATs and GNPAT, either alone or in combinations. Our results suggest that the balance between GPATs and GNPAT affect the levels of ether lipids, together with glycerophospholipid acyl chain length and unsaturation. In addition, we found that lipid synthesis initiated at peroxisomes, but not mitochondria, is sufficient to provide the lipid synthesis flux required for normal cell growth. Our study unveils the multifaceted roles of the first step of de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis, thus leading to a better understanding of how lipidomes are shaped.\nStimulation of NCAM1-14.3.3.ζδ-derived Peptide Interaction Fuels Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis in Ageing\nAuthors: Kusumbe, A.; Yesin, T.; Liu, H.; Ding, Z.; Singh, A.; Zhang, Y.; Chen, J.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575939\nThe skeletal structure and bone marrow endothelium collectively form a critical functional unit essential for bone development, health, and aging. At the core of osteogenesis and bone formation lies the dynamic process of angiogenesis. In this study, we reveal a potent new endogenous anabolic NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction, which stimulates bone angiogenesis and osteogenesis during homeostasis, aging, and age-related bone diseases. Employing high-resolution imaging and inducible cell-specific mouse genetics, our results elucidate the pivotal role of the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction in driving the expansion of Clec14a+ angiogenic endothelial cells. Notably, Clec14a+ endothelial cells express key osteogenic factors. The NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction in osteoblasts drives osteoblast differentiation, ultimately contributing to the genesis of new bone. Moreover, the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction leads to a reduction in bone resorption. In age-associated vascular and bone loss diseases, stimulating the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction not only promotes angiogenesis but also reverses bone loss. Consequently, harnessing the endogenous anabolic potential of the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction emerges as a promising therapeutic modality for managing age-related bone diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The front of migratory cellular clusters during development, wound healing and cancer invasion is typically populated with highly protrusive cells that are called leader cells. Leader cells are thought to physically pull and direct their cohort of followers, but how leaders and followers are mechanically organized to migrate collectively remains controversial. One possibility is that the autonomous local action of a leader cell is sufficient to drive migration of the group. Yet another possibility is that a global mechanical organization is required for the group to move cohesively. Here we show that the effectiveness of leader-follower organization is proportional to the asymmetry of traction and tension within the cellular cluster. By combining hydrogel micropatterning and optogenetic activation of Rac1, we locally generate highly protrusive leaders at the edge of minimal cell groups. We find that the induced leader can robustly drag one follower but is generally unable to direct larger groups. By measuring traction forces and tension propagation in groups of increasing size, we establish a quantitative relationship between group velocity and the asymmetry of the traction and tension profiles. We propose a model of the motile cluster as an active polar fluid that explains this force-velocity relationship in terms of asymmetries in the distribution of active tractions. Our results challenge the notion of autonomous leader cells by showing that collective cell migration requires a global mechanical organization within the cluster.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is structurally and functionally diverse, yet how its functions are organized within morphological subdomains is incompletely understood. Utilizing TurboID-based proximity labeling and CRISPR knock-in technologies, here we map the proteomic landscape of the human ER and nuclear envelope. Spatial proteomics reveals enrichments of proteins into ER tubules, sheets, and nuclear envelope. We uncover an ER-enriched actin-binding protein, Calmin (CLMN), and define it as an ER-actin tether that localizes to focal adhesions adjacent to ER tubules. CLMN depletion perturbs focal adhesion disassembly, actin dynamics, and cell movement. Mechanistically, CLMN-depleted cells also exhibit defects in calcium signaling near ER-actin interfaces, suggesting CLMN promotes calcium signaling near adhesions to facilitate their disassembly. Collectively, we map the sub-organelle proteome landscape of the ER, identify CLMN as an ER-actin tether, and describe a non-canonical mechanism by which ER tubules engage actin to regulate cell migration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytosolic aggregation of the nuclear protein TDP-43 is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, but the triggers for TDP-43 aggregation are still debated. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43 enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transitions into pathological aggregates. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells. We conclude that up-concentration inside condensates and simultaneous exposure to environmental stress could be a general pathway for protein aggregation, with intra-condensate demixing constituting a key intermediate step.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal organoids are valuable tools for researching developmental biology and personalized therapies, but their closed topology and relative immature state limits their applications. Here we use organ-on-chip technology to develop a hiPSC-derived intestinal barrier with apical and basolateral access in a more physiological in vitro microenvironment. To replicate growth factor gradients along the crypt- villus axis, we locally exposed the cells to expansion and differentiation media. In these conditions, intestinal epithelial cells self-organize into villus-like folds with physiological barrier integrity and myofibroblast and neural subtypes emerge and form a layer in the bottom channel underneath the epithelial tissue. The growth factor gradients efficiently balance dividing and mature cell types and induce an intestinal epithelial composition, including absorptive and secretory lineages, resembling the composition of the human adult small intestine. The result is a well-characterized hiPSC-derived intestine-on-chip system that can facilitate personalized studies on physiological processes and therapy development in the human small intestine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Calcium ions play important roles in nearly every biological process, yet whole-proteome analysis of calcium effectors has been hindered by lack of high-throughput, unbiased, and quantitative methods to identify proteins-calcium engagement. To address this, we adapted protein thermostability assays in the budding yeast, human cells, and mouse mitochondria. Based on calcium-dependent thermostability, we identified 2884 putative calcium-regulated proteins across human, mouse, and yeast proteomes. These data revealed calcium engagement of novel signaling hubs and cellular processes, including metabolic enzymes and the spliceosome. Cross-species comparison of calcium-protein engagement and mutagenesis experiments identified residue-specific cation engagement, even within well-known EF-hand domains. Additionally, we found that the dienoyl-CoA reductase DECR1 binds calcium at physiologically-relevant concentrations with substrate-specific affinity, suggesting direct calcium regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These unbiased, proteomic analyses of calcium effectors establish a key resource to dissect cation engagement and its mechanistic effects across multiple species and diverse biological processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employed a general reporter based on mutant Hsp104 to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. Over 300 proteins were identified, forming different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown solid inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES coaggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delayed ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interorganelle contacts facilitate material exchanges and sustain the structural and functional integrity of organelles. Lipid droplets (LDs) of adipocytes are responsible for energy storage and mobilization responding to body needs. LD biogenesis defects compromise the lipid-storing capacity of adipocytes, resulting in ectopic lipid deposition and metabolic disorders, yet how the uniquely large LDs in adipocytes attain structural and functional maturation is incompletely understood. Here we show that the mammalian adipocyte-specific protein CLSTN3B is crucial for adipocyte LD maturation. CLSTN3B employs an arginine-rich segment to promote extensive contact and hemifusion-like structure formation between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and LD, allowing ER-to-LD phospholipid diffusion during LD expansion. CLSTN3B ablation results in reduced LD surface phospholipid density, increased turnover of LD-surface proteins, and impaired LD functions. Our results establish the central role of CLSTN3B in the adipocyte-specific LD maturation pathway that enhances lipid storage and maintenance of metabolic health under caloric overload.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria are crucial metabolic organelles that are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular cues. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key component of the cellular environment that controls cellular behavior and metabolic activity. Here, we determined how ECM signalling regulates mitochondrial structure and activity. To distinguish mitochondrial regulation from the general survival cues generated by the ECM, we used breast cancer-derived spheres (mammospheres) because of their ability to grow in suspension culture in the absence of ECM. Using this system, we demonstrate that the association of mammospheres with the ECM results in dramatic mitochondrial elongation, along with enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. This remodeling occurs independently of DRP1 activity, but relies on integrin signaling and actin polymerization. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ECM-driven actin polymerization plays a crucial role in remodeling mitochondrial networks to promote OXPHOS, which represents a vital step for migrating cells to enhance cellular adhesion and facilitate cell growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increased use of lipidomics analyses in biomedical research made it crucial to understand correctly how lipid compositions are regulated. Lipid acyl chains are important regulators of membrane physicochemical properties, and are incorporated by various acyltransferases. The acyltransferases implicated in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis, the GPATs and GNPAT, have distinct localizations and substrate preferences. This suggests that they have distinct roles on lipid regulation, but a complete understanding of their redundant and non-redundant functions is missing. We report here a comprehensive analysis of cells having mutations in GPATs and GNPAT, either alone or in combinations. Our results suggest that the balance between GPATs and GNPAT affect the levels of ether lipids, together with glycerophospholipid acyl chain length and unsaturation. In addition, we found that lipid synthesis initiated at peroxisomes, but not mitochondria, is sufficient to provide the lipid synthesis flux required for normal cell growth. Our study unveils the multifaceted roles of the first step of de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis, thus leading to a better understanding of how lipidomes are shaped.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The skeletal structure and bone marrow endothelium collectively form a critical functional unit essential for bone development, health, and aging. At the core of osteogenesis and bone formation lies the dynamic process of angiogenesis. In this study, we reveal a potent new endogenous anabolic NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction, which stimulates bone angiogenesis and osteogenesis during homeostasis, aging, and age-related bone diseases. Employing high-resolution imaging and inducible cell-specific mouse genetics, our results elucidate the pivotal role of the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction in driving the expansion of Clec14a&#43; angiogenic endothelial cells. Notably, Clec14a&#43; endothelial cells express key osteogenic factors. The NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction in osteoblasts drives osteoblast differentiation, ultimately contributing to the genesis of new bone. Moreover, the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction leads to a reduction in bone resorption. In age-associated vascular and bone loss diseases, stimulating the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction not only promotes angiogenesis but also reverses bone loss. Consequently, harnessing the endogenous anabolic potential of the NCAM1-14.3.3.{zeta}{delta}-derived-Peptide interaction emerges as a promising therapeutic modality for managing age-related bone diseases.</p>
