A.; Harper, W.\nScore: 25.6, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546565\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a vast proteomic landscape to perform many diverse functions including protein and lipid synthesis, calcium ion flux, and inter-organelle communication. The ER proteome is remodeled in part through membrane-embedded receptors linking ER to degradative autophagy machinery (selective ER-phagy). A refined tubular ER network is formed in neurons within highly polarized dendrites and axons. Autophagy-deficient neurons in vivo display axonal ER accumulation within synaptic ER boutons, and the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B has been genetically linked with human sensory and autonomic neuropathy. However, mechanisms, including receptor selectivity, that define ER remodeling by autophagy in neurons are limited. Here, we combine a genetically tractable induced neuron (iNeuron) system for monitoring extensive ER remodeling during differentiation with proteomic and computational tools to create a quantitative landscape of ER proteome remodeling via selective autophagy. Through analysis of single and combinatorial ER-phagy receptor mutants, we delineate the extent to which each receptor contributes to both magnitude and selectivity of ER clearance via autophagy for individual ER protein cargos. We define specific subsets of ER curvature-shaping proteins or lumenal proteins as preferred clients for distinct receptors. Using spatial sensors and flux reporters, we demonstrate receptor-specific autophagic capture of ER in axons, which correlates with aberrant ER accumulation in axons of ER-phagy receptor or autophagy-deficient neurons. This molecular inventory of ER proteome remodeling and versatile genetic toolkit provides a quantitative framework for understanding contributions of individual ER-phagy receptors for reshaping ER during cell state transitions.\nA Dual Color Pax7 and Myf5 In Vivo Reporter to Investigate Muscle Stem Cell Heterogeneity in Regeneration and Aging\nAuthors: Ancel, S.; Michaud, J.; Sizzano, F.; Tauzin, L.; Oliveira, M.; Migliavacca, E.; Dammone, G.; Karaz, S.; Sanchez-Garcia, J. L.; Metairon, S.; Jacot, G.; Bentzinger, F. C.; Feige, J. N.; Stuelsatz, P.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545587\nIncreasing evidence suggests that muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are a heterogeneous population. In particular, a rare subset of Pax7 positive MuSCs that has never expressed the myogenic regulatory factor Myf5 has been shown to have superior self-renewal and engraftment characteristics when compared to lineage positive cells. However, their scarcity and the limited availability of protein markers make the characterization of this MuSC subpopulation challenging. Complementing lineage tracing approaches, we developed the StemRep in vivo model with reporter alleles allowing to monitor Pax7 and Myf5 protein levels based on equimolar amounts of dual nuclear fluorescence. Using transcriptomic profiling and ex vivo cellular assays, we demonstrate that levels of Pax7 and Myf5 protein delineate subpopulations of MuSCs with distinct molecular signatures and dynamics of activation, proliferation, and commitment. MuSCs expressing high levels of Pax7 protein (Pax7high) and low levels of Myf5 (Myf5Low) retain phenotypic features and molecular signatures of quiescence, and transiently remodel during regeneration. The Pax7 reporter tracks the decline of the MuSC pool during aging, while the Myf5 reporter enables live monitoring of the age-related loss of quiescence via skewing of the MuSC population towards Myf5High. Altogether, we characterize Pax7highMyf5Low MuSCs as an uncommitted subpopulation in deep quiescence and establish the StemRep line as a novel versatile tool for the physiological study of stem cell dynamics in skeletal muscle.\nSingle-molecule imaging reveals the kinetics of non-homologous end-joining in living cells\nAuthors: Mikhova, M.; Heyza, J. R.; Meek, K.; Schmidt, J. C.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546088\nNon-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the predominant path-way that repairs DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in vertebrates. The DNA termini of many DSBs must be processed to allow ligation while minimizing genetic changes that result from break repair. Emerging models propose that DNA termini are first synapsed approximately 115[A] apart in one of two long-range synaptic complexes. The first long-range complex can be formed with only the KU70/80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs while the second long-range complex also includes XRCC4, XLF, and Ligase 4. Both long-range complexes inefficiently progress to short-range synaptic complexes that juxtapose DNA ends to facilitate ligation. Here we perform singlemolecule analyses of the recruitment of Halo-tagged NHEJ factors to DSBs. Our results provide direct evidence for stepwise maturation of NHEJ complex and precisely define kinetics of core NHEJ factor binding to DSBs in living cells.\nThermosensitivity of translation underlies the mammalian nocturnal-diurnal switch\nAuthors: Beale, A.

Y.; Lancaster, M. A.; Hut, R. A.; O'Neill, J. S.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546020\nEarly mammals were nocturnal until the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction facilitated their rapid expansion into daytime niches. Diurnality subsequently evolved multiple times, independently, but the mechanisms facilitating this switch are unknown. We found that physiological daily temperature shifts oppositely affect circadian clock rhythms in nocturnal versus diurnal mammals. This occurs through a cell-intrinsic signal inverter, mediated by global differences in protein phosphorylation, and effected at the level of bulk protein synthesis rates, with diurnal translation rate being less thermosensitive than nocturnal. Perturbations that reduce translational initiation or mTOR activity are sufficient to trigger the nocturnal-to-diurnal switch at the cellular, tissue, and organismal scale. Our results suggest a convergent selection pressure to attain diurnality by reducing the effect of temperature-dependent changes in protein synthesis on circadian clocks.

Current guidelines for treating PAD include endovascular strategies or bypass surgery but long-term outcomes have been suboptimal. This is likely due to our limited understanding of the contribution of the microvasculature as well as other cell types, in particular macrophages, to PAD skeletal muscle pathophysiology. We used single cell sequencing to investigate cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity of the skeletal muscle microenvironment in PAD. MethodsSamples from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle of individuals undergoing either lower limb aneurysm surgery (controls) or PAD bypass surgery (PAD) were collected. Samples were either frozen for histological evaluation (control: n=4; PAD: n=6) or were immediately processed for single cell RNA sequencing of mononuclear cells (control: n=4; PAD: n= 4). Bioinformatic tools were used to annotate cell types and their subpopulations, to study transcriptional changes and to analyze cellular interactions. ResultsWe generated a dataset comprised of 106,566 high-quality, deep-sequenced cells that compose the muscle microenvironment. Focusing on endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages, we confirmed the presence of ATF3/4+ ECs with angiogenic and immune regulatory capacities in human muscle and found that their transcriptional profile profoundly alters during PAD. Also, capillary ECs display features of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, we identified LYVE1hiMHCIIlow resident macrophages as the dominant macrophage population in human muscle, even under a chronic inflammatory condition such as PAD. During PAD, LYVE1hiMHCIIlow macrophages get activated and acquire a more pro-inflammatory profile. Finally, we map strong intercellular communication in the muscle microenvironment, which is significantly altered in PAD. ConclusionsThe dataset we present here provides a highly valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into the critical roles that cells in the muscle microenvironment may play in PAD skeletal muscle pathology. We propose that targeting the crosstalk between ECs and macrophages could provide novel insights for developing effective treatments against this disease.\nMitochondria- and ER-associated actin are required for mitochondrial fusion\nAuthors: Gatti, P.; Schiavon, C. R.; Manor, U.; Germain, M.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2023-06-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544768\nMitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and signalling. Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove damaged or defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments that drive the recruitment and activation of the fission GTPase DRP1. On the other hand, the role of mitochondria- and ER- associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fusion remains unknown. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER using organelle- targeted Disassembly-promoting, encodable Actin tools (DeActs) blocks both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, and both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin in mitochondrial fusion.\nEpithelial Yap/Taz are required for functional alveolar regeneration following acute lung injury\nAuthors: DiGiovanni, G. T.; Han, W.; Sherrill, T.; Taylor, C. J.; Nichols, D. S.; Geis, N. M.; Singha, U. K.; Calvi, C. L.; McCall, A. S.; Dixon, M. M.; Lui, Y.; Jang, J.-H.; Gutor, S. S.; Polosukhin, V. V.; Blackwell, T. S.; Kropski, J. A.; Gokey, J. J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.545997\nA hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other interstitial lung diseases is dysregulated repair of the alveolar epithelium. The Hippo pathway effector transcription factors YAP and TAZ have been implicated as essential for type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cell (AT1 and AT2) differentiation in the developing lung, yet aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ is a prominent feature of the dysregulated alveolar epithelium in IPF. In these studies, we sought to define the functional role of YAP/TAZ activity during alveolar regeneration. We demonstrate that Yap and Taz are normally activated in AT2 cells shortly after injury, and deletion of Yap/Taz in AT2 cells led to pathologic alveolar remodeling, failure of AT2 to AT1 cell differentiation, increased collagen deposition, exaggerated neutrophilic inflammation, and increased mortality following injury induced by a single dose of bleomycin. Loss of Yap/Taz activity prior to a LPS injury prevented AT1 cell regeneration, led to intra-alveolar collagen deposition, and resulted in persistent innate inflammation. Together these findings establish that AT2 cell Yap/Taz activity is essential for functional alveolar epithelial repair and prevention of fibrotic remodeling.\nGTPase activating protein DLC1 spatio-temporally regulates Rho signaling\nAuthors: Heydasch, M.; Hinderling, L.; van Unen, J.; Dobrzynski, M.; Pertz, O.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545304\nTightly regulated spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activity patterns regulate morphogenetic processes such as cell migration. Emerging evidence suggests that binding of Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to the cytoskeleton or adhesions mediate feedback regulation to spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation. To explore such feedback regulation, we study the Rho specific GAP Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) which binds to focal adhesions (FAs) through mechanosensitive interactions. Using a FRET biosensor, we show that DLC1 loss of function leads to global increase in Rho activity and contractility throughout the cell without affecting a striking lamellar RhoA activity band in fibroblasts. To interrogate the Rho GTPase signaling flux, we build a genetic circuit consisting of an optogenetic actuator to control Rho activity, and a Rho activity biosensor. In spreading cells at steady state, optogenetic manipulation of Rho activity reveals that DLC1 controls the rate of Rho activation rather than duration, both at FAs and at the plasma membrane (PM). Local and reversible optogenetic control of contractility shows that DLC1 associates/dissociates with FAs during their reinforcement/relaxation. This might provide positive feedback that locally increases the rate of Rho activation at FAs that experience local tension to facilitate FA disassembly. Our results indicate that DLC1 operates both at the PM and at FAs to regulate global Rho activity levels at steady state, or to amplify local Rho activity at FAs experiencing a strong mechanical input, presumably to induce robust FA disassembly. This provides new insights in the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling.\nExploring the interactome of PML nuclear subdomains during fatty acid stress using APEX2-mediated proximity labeling\nAuthors: Thompson, J.; Boisvert, F.-M.; Salsman, J.; Dellaire, G.; Ridgway, N. D.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545954\nWhen exposed to excess fatty acids, specific cell types produce nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) that associate with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein to form Lipid Associated PML Structures (LAPS) that are enriched in lipid biosynthetic enzymes but deficient in canonical proteins associated with PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). To identify the PML interactome during lipid stress, we employed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) in U2OS cells expressing PMLI and PMLII fused to the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 and cultured in the absence or presence of oleate to enhance lipid droplet formation. The resulting interactome included proteins enriched under oleate-treated conditions, such mitogen activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), ESCRT proteins and the COPII vesicle transport proteins Sec23B, Sec24A and USO1. COPII proteins co-localized with both PML-NBs and LAPS but were selectively enriched in PML-NBs following oleate treatment. The nuclear localization of USO1 was uniquely dependent on PML expression. Thus, the APEX2-PML proximity interactome implicates PML domains in the nuclear function of a non-canonical network of COPII vesicle trafficking proteins. SUMMARY STATEMENTThis is the first study to utilize APEX2 proximity labelling to identify the protein interactome of PML nuclear substructures and how interactions are modified under conditions of fatty acid-induced stress.\nFunctional glycoproteomics by integrated network assembly and partitioning\nAuthors: Griffin, M. E.; Thompson, J. W.; Xiao, Y.; Sweredoski, M. J.; Jensen, E. H.; Koldobskaya, Y.; Schacht, A. L.; Kim, T. D.; Choudhry, P.; Lomenick, B.; Garbis, S. D.; Moradian, A.; Hsieh-Wilson, L. C.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-06-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.541482\nThe post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by O-linked {beta}-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is widespread across the proteome during the lifespan of all multicellular organisms. However, nearly all functional studies have focused on individual protein modifications, overlooking the multitude of simultaneous O-GlcNAcylation events that work together to coordinate cellular activities. Here, we describe Networking of Interactors and SubstratEs (NISE), a novel, systems-level approach to rapidly and comprehensively monitor O-GlcNAcylation across the proteome. Our method integrates affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and site-specific chemoproteomic technologies with network generation and unsupervised partitioning to connect potential upstream regulators with downstream targets of O-GlcNAcylation. The resulting network provides a data-rich framework that reveals both conserved activities of O-GlcNAcylation such as epigenetic regulation as well as tissue-specific functions like synaptic morphology. Beyond O-GlcNAc, this holistic and unbiased systems-level approach provides a broadly applicable framework to study PTMs and discover their diverse roles in specific cell types and biological states.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a vast proteomic landscape to perform many diverse functions including protein and lipid synthesis, calcium ion flux, and inter-organelle communication. The ER proteome is remodeled in part through membrane-embedded receptors linking ER to degradative autophagy machinery (selective ER-phagy). A refined tubular ER network is formed in neurons within highly polarized dendrites and axons. Autophagy-deficient neurons in vivo display axonal ER accumulation within synaptic ER boutons, and the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B has been genetically linked with human sensory and autonomic neuropathy. However, mechanisms, including receptor selectivity, that define ER remodeling by autophagy in neurons are limited. Here, we combine a genetically tractable induced neuron (iNeuron) system for monitoring extensive ER remodeling during differentiation with proteomic and computational tools to create a quantitative landscape of ER proteome remodeling via selective autophagy. Through analysis of single and combinatorial ER-phagy receptor mutants, we delineate the extent to which each receptor contributes to both magnitude and selectivity of ER clearance via autophagy for individual ER protein cargos. We define specific subsets of ER curvature-shaping proteins or lumenal proteins as preferred clients for distinct receptors. Using spatial sensors and flux reporters, we demonstrate receptor-specific autophagic capture of ER in axons, which correlates with aberrant ER accumulation in axons of ER-phagy receptor or autophagy-deficient neurons. This molecular inventory of ER proteome remodeling and versatile genetic toolkit provides a quantitative framework for understanding contributions of individual ER-phagy receptors for reshaping ER during cell state transitions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increasing evidence suggests that muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are a heterogeneous population. In particular, a rare subset of Pax7 positive MuSCs that has never expressed the myogenic regulatory factor Myf5 has been shown to have superior self-renewal and engraftment characteristics when compared to lineage positive cells. However, their scarcity and the limited availability of protein markers make the characterization of this MuSC subpopulation challenging. Complementing lineage tracing approaches, we developed the StemRep in vivo model with reporter alleles allowing to monitor Pax7 and Myf5 protein levels based on equimolar amounts of dual nuclear fluorescence. Using transcriptomic profiling and ex vivo cellular assays, we demonstrate that levels of Pax7 and Myf5 protein delineate subpopulations of MuSCs with distinct molecular signatures and dynamics of activation, proliferation, and commitment. MuSCs expressing high levels of Pax7 protein (Pax7high) and low levels of Myf5 (Myf5Low) retain phenotypic features and molecular signatures of quiescence, and transiently remodel during regeneration. The Pax7 reporter tracks the decline of the MuSC pool during aging, while the Myf5 reporter enables live monitoring of the age-related loss of quiescence via skewing of the MuSC population towards Myf5High. Altogether, we characterize Pax7highMyf5Low MuSCs as an uncommitted subpopulation in deep quiescence and establish the StemRep line as a novel versatile tool for the physiological study of stem cell dynamics in skeletal muscle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the predominant path-way that repairs DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in vertebrates. The DNA termini of many DSBs must be processed to allow ligation while minimizing genetic changes that result from break repair. Emerging models propose that DNA termini are first synapsed approximately 115[A] apart in one of two long-range synaptic complexes. The first long-range complex can be formed with only the KU70/80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs while the second long-range complex also includes XRCC4, XLF, and Ligase 4. Both long-range complexes inefficiently progress to short-range synaptic complexes that juxtapose DNA ends to facilitate ligation. Here we perform singlemolecule analyses of the recruitment of Halo-tagged NHEJ factors to DSBs. Our results provide direct evidence for stepwise maturation of NHEJ complex and precisely define kinetics of core NHEJ factor binding to DSBs in living cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early mammals were nocturnal until the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction facilitated their rapid expansion into daytime niches. Diurnality subsequently evolved multiple times, independently, but the mechanisms facilitating this switch are unknown. We found that physiological daily temperature shifts oppositely affect circadian clock rhythms in nocturnal versus diurnal mammals. This occurs through a cell-intrinsic signal inverter, mediated by global differences in protein phosphorylation, and effected at the level of bulk protein synthesis rates, with diurnal translation rate being less thermosensitive than nocturnal. Perturbations that reduce translational initiation or mTOR activity are sufficient to trigger the nocturnal-to-diurnal switch at the cellular, tissue, and organismal scale. Our results suggest a convergent selection pressure to attain diurnality by reducing the effect of temperature-dependent changes in protein synthesis on circadian clocks.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPeripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerosis and chronic narrowing of lower limb arteries leading to decreased muscle perfusion and oxygenation. Current guidelines for treating PAD include endovascular strategies or bypass surgery but long-term outcomes have been suboptimal. This is likely due to our limited understanding of the contribution of the microvasculature as well as other cell types, in particular macrophages, to PAD skeletal muscle pathophysiology. We used single cell sequencing to investigate cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity of the skeletal muscle microenvironment in PAD.

MethodsSamples from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle of individuals undergoing either lower limb aneurysm surgery (controls) or PAD bypass surgery (PAD) were collected. Samples were either frozen for histological evaluation (control: n=4; PAD: n=6) or were immediately processed for single cell RNA sequencing of mononuclear cells (control: n=4; PAD: n= 4). Bioinformatic tools were used to annotate cell types and their subpopulations, to study transcriptional changes and to analyze cellular interactions.

ResultsWe generated a dataset comprised of 106,566 high-quality, deep-sequenced cells that compose the muscle microenvironment. Focusing on endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages, we confirmed the presence of ATF3/4&#43; ECs with angiogenic and immune regulatory capacities in human muscle and found that their transcriptional profile profoundly alters during PAD. Also, capillary ECs display features of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, we identified LYVE1hiMHCIIlow resident macrophages as the dominant macrophage population in human muscle, even under a chronic inflammatory condition such as PAD. During PAD, LYVE1hiMHCIIlow macrophages get activated and acquire a more pro-inflammatory profile. Finally, we map strong intercellular communication in the muscle microenvironment, which is significantly altered in PAD.

ConclusionsThe dataset we present here provides a highly valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into the critical roles that cells in the muscle microenvironment may play in PAD skeletal muscle pathology. We propose that targeting the crosstalk between ECs and macrophages could provide novel insights for developing effective treatments against this disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and signalling. Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove damaged or defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments that drive the recruitment and activation of the fission GTPase DRP1. On the other hand, the role of mitochondria- and ER- associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fusion remains unknown. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER using organelle- targeted Disassembly-promoting, encodable Actin tools (DeActs) blocks both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, and both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin in mitochondrial fusion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other interstitial lung diseases is dysregulated repair of the alveolar epithelium. The Hippo pathway effector transcription factors YAP and TAZ have been implicated as essential for type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cell (AT1 and AT2) differentiation in the developing lung, yet aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ is a prominent feature of the dysregulated alveolar epithelium in IPF. In these studies, we sought to define the functional role of YAP/TAZ activity during alveolar regeneration. We demonstrate that Yap and Taz are normally activated in AT2 cells shortly after injury, and deletion of Yap/Taz in AT2 cells led to pathologic alveolar remodeling, failure of AT2 to AT1 cell differentiation, increased collagen deposition, exaggerated neutrophilic inflammation, and increased mortality following injury induced by a single dose of bleomycin. Loss of Yap/Taz activity prior to a LPS injury prevented AT1 cell regeneration, led to intra-alveolar collagen deposition, and resulted in persistent innate inflammation. Together these findings establish that AT2 cell Yap/Taz activity is essential for functional alveolar epithelial repair and prevention of fibrotic remodeling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tightly regulated spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activity patterns regulate morphogenetic processes such as cell migration. Emerging evidence suggests that binding of Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to the cytoskeleton or adhesions mediate feedback regulation to spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation. To explore such feedback regulation, we study the Rho specific GAP Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) which binds to focal adhesions (FAs) through mechanosensitive interactions. Using a FRET biosensor, we show that DLC1 loss of function leads to global increase in Rho activity and contractility throughout the cell without affecting a striking lamellar RhoA activity band in fibroblasts. To interrogate the Rho GTPase signaling flux, we build a genetic circuit consisting of an optogenetic actuator to control Rho activity, and a Rho activity biosensor. In spreading cells at steady state, optogenetic manipulation of Rho activity reveals that DLC1 controls the rate of Rho activation rather than duration, both at FAs and at the plasma membrane (PM). Local and reversible optogenetic control of contractility shows that DLC1 associates/dissociates with FAs during their reinforcement/relaxation. This might provide positive feedback that locally increases the rate of Rho activation at FAs that experience local tension to facilitate FA disassembly. Our results indicate that DLC1 operates both at the PM and at FAs to regulate global Rho activity levels at steady state, or to amplify local Rho activity at FAs experiencing a strong mechanical input, presumably to induce robust FA disassembly. This provides new insights in the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling.</p>

To identify the PML interactome during lipid stress, we employed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) in U2OS cells expressing PMLI and PMLII fused to the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 and cultured in the absence or presence of oleate to enhance lipid droplet formation. The resulting interactome included proteins enriched under oleate-treated conditions, such mitogen activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), ESCRT proteins and the COPII vesicle transport proteins Sec23B, Sec24A and USO1. COPII proteins co-localized with both PML-NBs and LAPS but were selectively enriched in PML-NBs following oleate treatment. The nuclear localization of USO1 was uniquely dependent on PML expression. Thus, the APEX2-PML proximity interactome implicates PML domains in the nuclear function of a non-canonical network of COPII vesicle trafficking proteins.

SUMMARY STATEMENTThis is the first study to utilize APEX2 proximity labelling to identify the protein interactome of PML nuclear substructures and how interactions are modified under conditions of fatty acid-induced stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by O-linked {beta}-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is widespread across the proteome during the lifespan of all multicellular organisms. However, nearly all functional studies have focused on individual protein modifications, overlooking the multitude of simultaneous O-GlcNAcylation events that work together to coordinate cellular activities. Here, we describe Networking of Interactors and SubstratEs (NISE), a novel, systems-level approach to rapidly and comprehensively monitor O-GlcNAcylation across the proteome. Our method integrates affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and site-specific chemoproteomic technologies with network generation and unsupervised partitioning to connect potential upstream regulators with downstream targets of O-GlcNAcylation. The resulting network provides a data-rich framework that reveals both conserved activities of O-GlcNAcylation such as epigenetic regulation as well as tissue-specific functions like synaptic morphology. Beyond O-GlcNAc, this holistic and unbiased systems-level approach provides a broadly applicable framework to study PTMs and discover their diverse roles in specific cell types and biological states.</p>
