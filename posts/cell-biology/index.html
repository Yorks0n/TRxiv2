  "articleBody": " A liquid-like coat mediates chromosome clustering during mitotic exit\nAuthors: Hernandez-Armendariz, A.; Sorichetti, V.; Hayashi, Y.; Brunner, A.; Ellenberg, J.; Saric, A.; Cuylen-Haering, S.\nScore: 45.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568026\nThe individualization of chromosomes during early mitosis and their clustering upon exit from cell division are two key transitions that ensure efficient segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes. Both processes are regulated by the surfactant-like protein Ki-67, but how Ki-67 achieves these diametric functions has remained unknown. Here, we report that Ki-67 radically switches from a chromosome repellent to a chromosome attractant during anaphase. We show that Ki-67 dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and the simultaneous exposure of a conserved basic patch induce the RNA-dependent formation of a liquid-like condensed phase on the chromosome surface. Experiments and coarse-grained simulations support a model in which the coalescence of chromosome surfaces driven by phase separation promote clustering of chromosomes. Our study reveals how the switch of Ki-67 from a surfactant to a liquid-like condensed phase can generate the mechanical forces during genome segregation that are required for re-establishing nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization after mitosis.\nA mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit integrates genome integrity with inflammation\nAuthors: Miller, K. N.; Li, B.; Pierce-Hoffman, H. R.; Lei, X.; Havas, A. P.; Patel, S.; Cano Macip, C.; Victorelli, S. G.; Woo, S.-H.; Lagnado, A. B.; Liu, T.; Dasgupta, N.; Lyu, J.; Altman, Y.; Porritt, R. A.; Garcia, G.; Mogler, C.; Dou, Z.; Chen, C.; Passos, J. F.; Adams, P. D.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567963\nGenomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.\nDynamic label-free analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals virus-induced subcellular remodeling.\nAuthors: Saunders, N.; Monel, B.; Cayet, N.; Archetti, L.; Moreno, H.; Jeanne, A.; Marguier, A.; Wai, T.; Schwartz, O.; Frechin, M.\nScore: 76.3, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567378\nAssessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.\nCryoET reveals actin filaments within platelet microtubules\nAuthors: Tsuji, C.; Bradshaw, M.; Allen, M.; Jackson, M. L.; Mantell, J.; Borucu, U.; Poole, A. W.; Verkade, P.; Hers, I.; Paul, D. M.; Dodding, M.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568450\nCrosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for many cellular processes. Recent studies have shown that microtubules and F-actin can assemble to form a composite structure where F-actin occupies the microtubule lumen. Whether these cytoskeletal hybrids exist in physiological settings and how they are formed is unclear. Here, we show that the short-crossover Class I actin filament previously identified inside microtubules in human HAP1 cells is cofilin-bound F-actin. Lumenal F-actin can be reconstituted in vitro, but cofilin is not essential. Moreover, actin filaments with both cofilin-bound and canonical morphologies reside within human platelet microtubules under physiological conditions. We propose that stress placed upon the microtubule network during motor-driven microtubule looping and sliding may facilitate the incorporation of actin into microtubules.\nHuman Pancreatic α-Cell Heterogeneity and Trajectory Inference Analysis Using Integrated Single Cell- and Single Nucleus-RNA Sequencing Platforms\nAuthors: Kang, R. B.; Lee, J.; Varela, M.; Li, Y.; Rosselot, C.; Zhang, T.; Karakose, E.; Stewart, A. F.; Scott, D. K.; Garcia-Ocana, A.; Lu, G.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-11-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.567715\nPrior studies have shown that pancreatic -cells can transdifferentiate into {beta}-cells, and that {beta}-cells de-differentiate and are prone to acquire an -cell phenotype in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the specific human -cell and {beta}-cell subtypes that are involved in -to-{beta}-cell and {beta}-to--cell transitions are unknown. Here, we have integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of isolated human islets and human islet grafts and provide additional insight into -{beta} cell fate switching. Using this approach, we make seven novel observations. 1) There are five different GCG-expressing human -cell subclusters [1, 2, -{beta}-transition 1 (AB-Tr1), -{beta}-transition 2 (AB-Tr2), and -{beta} (AB) cluster] with different transcriptome profiles in human islets from non-diabetic donors. 2) The AB subcluster displays multihormonal gene expression, inferred mostly from snRNA-seq data suggesting identification by pre-mRNA expression. 3) The 1, 2, AB-Tr1, and AB-Tr2 subclusters are enriched in genes specific for -cell function while AB cells are enriched in genes related to pancreatic progenitor and {beta}-cell pathways; 4) Trajectory inference analysis of extracted - and {beta}-cell clusters and RNA velocity/PAGA analysis suggests a bifurcate transition potential for AB towards both - and {beta}-cells. 5) Gene commonality analysis identifies ZNF385D, TRPM3, CASR, MEG3 and HDAC9 as signature for trajectories moving towards {beta}-cells and SMOC1, PLCE1, PAPPA2, ZNF331, ALDH1A1, SLC30A8, BTG2, TM4SF4, NR4A1 and PSCK2 as signature for trajectories moving towards -cells. 6) Remarkably, in contrast to the events in vitro, the AB subcluster is not identified in vivo in human islet grafts and trajectory inference analysis suggests only unidirectional transition from -to-{beta}-cells in vivo. 7) Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from adult human T2D donor islets reveals a clear unidirectional transition from {beta}-to--cells compatible with dedifferentiation or conversion into -cells. Collectively, these studies show that snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq can be leveraged to identify transitions in the transcriptional status among human islet endocrine cell subpopulations in vitro, in vivo, in non-diabetes and in T2D. They reveal the potential gene signatures for common trajectories involved in interconversion between - and {beta}-cells and highlight the utility and power of studying single nuclear transcriptomes of human islets in vivo. Most importantly, they illustrate the importance of studying human islets in their natural in vivo setting.\nIlluminating the complete β-cell mass of the human pancreas - signifying a new view on the islets of Langerhans\nAuthors: Lehrstrand, J.; Davies, W. L.; Hahn, M.; Korsgren, O.; Alanentalo, T.; Ahlgren, U.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.566244\nPancreatic islets of Langerhans play a pivotal role in regulating blood glucose homeostasis, but critical information regarding their mass, distribution and composition is lacking within a whole organ context. Here, a new 3D imaging pipeline was applied to generate a first complete account of the insulin-producing islets throughout the human pancreas at a microscopic resolution and within a maintained spatial 3D context. These data show that human islets are far more heterogenous than previously accounted for with regards to their size distribution and cellular make up. By deep tissue 3D imaging, this in-depth study demonstrates that 50% of the human insulin-expressing islets are virtually devoid of glucagon-producing a-cells, an observation with significant implications for both experimental and clinical research. One Sentence Summary: New islet heterogeneity identified in the human pancreas\nStayGold Photostability under Different Illumination Modes\nAuthors: Hirano, M.; Yonemaru, Y.; Shimozono, S.; Sugiyama, M.; Ando, R.; Okada, Y.; Fujiwara, T.; Miyawaki, A.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568490\nStayGold is a bright fluorescent protein (FP) that is over one order of magnitude more photostable than any of the currently available FPs across the full range of illumination intensities used in widefield microscopy and structured illumination microscopy, the latter of which is a widefield illumination-based technique. To compare the photostability of StayGold under other illumination modes with that of three other green-emitting FPs, namely EGFP, mClover3, and mNeonGreen, we expressed all four FPs as fusions to histone 2B in HeLa cells. Unlike the case of widefield microscopy, the photobleaching behavior of these FPs in laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is complicated. The outstanding photostability of StayGold observed in multi-beam LSCM was variably attenuated in single-beam LSCM, which produces intermittent and instantaneously strong illumination. We systematically examined the effects of different single-beam LSCM beam-scanning patterns on the photostability of the FPs. This study offers relevant guidelines for researchers who aim to achieve sustainable imaging by resolving problems related to FP photostability.\nNon-muscle myosin II regulates presynaptic actin assemblies and neuronal mechanobiology\nAuthors: Ermanoska, B.; Rodal, A. A.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566609\nNeuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are evolutionarily ancient, specialized contacts between neurons and muscles. Axons and NMJs must endure mechanical strain through a lifetime of muscle contraction, making them vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. However, cellular strategies for mitigating this mechanical stress remain unknown. In this study, we used Drosophila larval NMJs to investigate the role of actin and myosin (actomyosin)-mediated contractility in generating and responding to cellular forces at the neuron-muscle interface. We identified a new long-lived, low-turnover presynaptic actin core traversing the NMJ, which partly co-localizes with non-muscle myosin II (NMII). Neuronal RNAi of NMII induced disorganization of this core, suggesting that this structure might have contractile properties. Interestingly, neuronal RNAi of NMII also decreased NMII levels in the postsynaptic muscle proximal to neurons, suggesting that neuronal actomyosin rearrangements propagate their effects trans-synaptically. We also observed reduced Integrin levels upon NMII knockdown, indicating that neuronal actomyosin disruption triggers rearrangements of Integrin-mediated connections between neurons and surrounding muscle tissue. In summary, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized presynaptic actomyosin subpopulation that upholds the neuronal mechanical continuum, transmits signals to adjacent muscle tissue, and collaborates with Integrin receptors to govern the mechanobiology of the neuromuscular junction.\nGenomic and phenotypic stability of fusion-driven pediatric Ewing sarcoma cell lines\nAuthors: Kasan, M.; Siebenlist, J.; Sill, M.; Oellinger, R.; de Alava, E.; Surdez, D.; Dirksen, U.; Oehme, I.; Scotlandi, K.; Delattre, O.; Mueller-Nurasyid, M.; Rad, R.; Strauch, K.; Gruenewald, T. G. P.; Cidre-Aranaz, F.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567802\nHuman cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. This highlighted how despite human cell line models being powerful tools for cancer research, the findings derived from their use may present limitations in terms of reproducibility. However, to what extent these conclusions can be generalized to the majority of cancer cell lines remained unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines driven by a chimeric oncogenic transcription factor (COTF), such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), were genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated (adult) carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains in direct comparison to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture showed that COTF-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. The analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture conditions revealed that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic may be observed among COTF-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity.\nOptogenetic control of lysosome function\nAuthors: Ilyinsky, N.

I.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551716\nLysosome protective, metabolic, signaling functions are highly dependent on their pH. A lack of tools of high spatial and temporal resolution for pH control is a bottleneck of lysosome related cell research. Light-driven inward proton pump NsXeR, targeted to the lysosomes of mammalian cells, produces lysosome alkalization simply by light. Complementary use of outward proton pumping Arch3 rhodopsins in lysosomes offers an approach to vary pH in a range from around 5 to 6.5 in both directions (de-acidification and acidification). Lyso-NsXeR optogenetics efficiency was demonstrated, in particular, by its ability to inhibit lysosome proteolytic enzymes. Thus, optogenetic monitoring and regulation of the lysosome function, through pH control over a wide range, could serve as an approach to studying fundamental cell processes, and rational drug design.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The individualization of chromosomes during early mitosis and their clustering upon exit from cell division are two key transitions that ensure efficient segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes. Both processes are regulated by the surfactant-like protein Ki-67, but how Ki-67 achieves these diametric functions has remained unknown. Here, we report that Ki-67 radically switches from a chromosome repellent to a chromosome attractant during anaphase. We show that Ki-67 dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and the simultaneous exposure of a conserved basic patch induce the RNA-dependent formation of a liquid-like condensed phase on the chromosome surface. Experiments and coarse-grained simulations support a model in which the coalescence of chromosome surfaces driven by phase separation promote clustering of chromosomes. Our study reveals how the switch of Ki-67 from a surfactant to a liquid-like condensed phase can generate the mechanical forces during genome segregation that are required for re-establishing nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization after mitosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for many cellular processes. Recent studies have shown that microtubules and F-actin can assemble to form a composite structure where F-actin occupies the microtubule lumen. Whether these cytoskeletal hybrids exist in physiological settings and how they are formed is unclear. Here, we show that the short-crossover Class I actin filament previously identified inside microtubules in human HAP1 cells is cofilin-bound F-actin. Lumenal F-actin can be reconstituted in vitro, but cofilin is not essential. Moreover, actin filaments with both cofilin-bound and canonical morphologies reside within human platelet microtubules under physiological conditions. We propose that stress placed upon the microtubule network during motor-driven microtubule looping and sliding may facilitate the incorporation of actin into microtubules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior studies have shown that pancreatic -cells can transdifferentiate into {beta}-cells, and that {beta}-cells de-differentiate and are prone to acquire an -cell phenotype in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the specific human -cell and {beta}-cell subtypes that are involved in -to-{beta}-cell and {beta}-to--cell transitions are unknown. Here, we have integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of isolated human islets and human islet grafts and provide additional insight into -{beta} cell fate switching. Using this approach, we make seven novel observations. 1) There are five different GCG-expressing human -cell subclusters [1, 2, -{beta}-transition 1 (AB-Tr1), -{beta}-transition 2 (AB-Tr2), and -{beta} (AB) cluster] with different transcriptome profiles in human islets from non-diabetic donors. 2) The AB subcluster displays multihormonal gene expression, inferred mostly from snRNA-seq data suggesting identification by pre-mRNA expression. 3) The 1, 2, AB-Tr1, and AB-Tr2 subclusters are enriched in genes specific for -cell function while AB cells are enriched in genes related to pancreatic progenitor and {beta}-cell pathways; 4) Trajectory inference analysis of extracted - and {beta}-cell clusters and RNA velocity/PAGA analysis suggests a bifurcate transition potential for AB towards both - and {beta}-cells. 5) Gene commonality analysis identifies ZNF385D, TRPM3, CASR, MEG3 and HDAC9 as signature for trajectories moving towards {beta}-cells and SMOC1, PLCE1, PAPPA2, ZNF331, ALDH1A1, SLC30A8, BTG2, TM4SF4, NR4A1 and PSCK2 as signature for trajectories moving towards -cells. 6) Remarkably, in contrast to the events in vitro, the AB subcluster is not identified in vivo in human islet grafts and trajectory inference analysis suggests only unidirectional transition from -to-{beta}-cells in vivo. 7) Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from adult human T2D donor islets reveals a clear unidirectional transition from {beta}-to--cells compatible with dedifferentiation or conversion into -cells. Collectively, these studies show that snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq can be leveraged to identify transitions in the transcriptional status among human islet endocrine cell subpopulations in vitro, in vivo, in non-diabetes and in T2D. They reveal the potential gene signatures for common trajectories involved in interconversion between - and {beta}-cells and highlight the utility and power of studying single nuclear transcriptomes of human islets in vivo. Most importantly, they illustrate the importance of studying human islets in their natural in vivo setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic islets of Langerhans play a pivotal role in regulating blood glucose homeostasis, but critical information regarding their mass, distribution and composition is lacking within a whole organ context. Here, a new 3D imaging pipeline was applied to generate a first complete account of the insulin-producing islets throughout the human pancreas at a microscopic resolution and within a maintained spatial 3D context. These data show that human islets are far more heterogenous than previously accounted for with regards to their size distribution and cellular make up. By deep tissue 3D imaging, this in-depth study demonstrates that 50% of the human insulin-expressing islets are virtually devoid of glucagon-producing a-cells, an observation with significant implications for both experimental and clinical research.

        <p class="abstract">StayGold is a bright fluorescent protein (FP) that is over one order of magnitude more photostable than any of the currently available FPs across the full range of illumination intensities used in widefield microscopy and structured illumination microscopy, the latter of which is a widefield illumination-based technique. To compare the photostability of StayGold under other illumination modes with that of three other green-emitting FPs, namely EGFP, mClover3, and mNeonGreen, we expressed all four FPs as fusions to histone 2B in HeLa cells. Unlike the case of widefield microscopy, the photobleaching behavior of these FPs in laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is complicated. The outstanding photostability of StayGold observed in multi-beam LSCM was variably attenuated in single-beam LSCM, which produces intermittent and instantaneously strong illumination. We systematically examined the effects of different single-beam LSCM beam-scanning patterns on the photostability of the FPs. This study offers relevant guidelines for researchers who aim to achieve sustainable imaging by resolving problems related to FP photostability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are evolutionarily ancient, specialized contacts between neurons and muscles. Axons and NMJs must endure mechanical strain through a lifetime of muscle contraction, making them vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. However, cellular strategies for mitigating this mechanical stress remain unknown. In this study, we used Drosophila larval NMJs to investigate the role of actin and myosin (actomyosin)-mediated contractility in generating and responding to cellular forces at the neuron-muscle interface. We identified a new long-lived, low-turnover presynaptic actin core traversing the NMJ, which partly co-localizes with non-muscle myosin II (NMII). Neuronal RNAi of NMII induced disorganization of this core, suggesting that this structure might have contractile properties. Interestingly, neuronal RNAi of NMII also decreased NMII levels in the postsynaptic muscle proximal to neurons, suggesting that neuronal actomyosin rearrangements propagate their effects trans-synaptically. We also observed reduced Integrin levels upon NMII knockdown, indicating that neuronal actomyosin disruption triggers rearrangements of Integrin-mediated connections between neurons and surrounding muscle tissue. In summary, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized presynaptic actomyosin subpopulation that upholds the neuronal mechanical continuum, transmits signals to adjacent muscle tissue, and collaborates with Integrin receptors to govern the mechanobiology of the neuromuscular junction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. This highlighted how despite human cell line models being powerful tools for cancer research, the findings derived from their use may present limitations in terms of reproducibility. However, to what extent these conclusions can be generalized to the majority of cancer cell lines remained unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines driven by a chimeric oncogenic transcription factor (COTF), such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), were genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated (adult) carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains in direct comparison to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture showed that COTF-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. The analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture conditions revealed that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic may be observed among COTF-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lysosome protective, metabolic, signaling functions are highly dependent on their pH. A lack of tools of high spatial and temporal resolution for pH control is a bottleneck of lysosome related cell research. Light-driven inward proton pump NsXeR, targeted to the lysosomes of mammalian cells, produces lysosome alkalization simply by light. Complementary use of outward proton pumping Arch3 rhodopsins in lysosomes offers an approach to vary pH in a range from around 5 to 6.5 in both directions (de-acidification and acidification). Lyso-NsXeR optogenetics efficiency was demonstrated, in particular, by its ability to inhibit lysosome proteolytic enzymes. Thus, optogenetic monitoring and regulation of the lysosome function, through pH control over a wide range, could serve as an approach to studying fundamental cell processes, and rational drug design.</p>
