C. O.; Mayor, U.; Elortza, F.; Polo, S.; Barrio, R.; Sutherland, J. D.\nScore: 59.6, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553883\nThe post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a highly regulated process that involves a dynamic, three-step enzymatic cascade, where more than 600 E3 ligases play a critical role in recognizing specific substrates for modification. Separating bona fide targets of E3s from E3-interacting proteins remains a major challenge in the field. In this study, we present BioE3, a novel approach for identifying substrates of ubiquitin-like (UbL) E3 ligases of interest. Using BirA-E3 ligase fusion proteins and bioUbLs, the method facilitates site-specific biotinylation of UbL-modified substrates of particular E3s for proteomic identification. We demonstrate that the BioE3 system can identify both known and novel targets of two RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases: RNF4, known to be involved in DNA damage 36 response and the regulation of PML nuclear bodies, and MIB1, implicated in endocytosis, autophagy, and centrosomal protein homeostasis. We further show the versatility of BioE3 by identifying targets of an organelle-specific E3 (MARCH5) and a relatively uncharacterized E3 (RNF214). Furthermore, we show that BioE3 works with HECT-type E3 ligases and identify novel targets of NEDD4 involved in vesicular trafficking. BioE3 is a powerful tool that enables identification of bona fide substrates of UbL E3 ligases and how they change with chemical perturbations. BioE3 may also be applicable for UbLs beyond Ub and SUMO, as well as other E3 ligase classes. The resulting knowledge can shed light on the regulation of cellular processes by the complex UbL network and provide information useful for strategies such as targeted protein degradation (TPD), advancing our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and their applications.\nComprehensive Interrogation of Synthetic Relationships in the Human DNA Damage Response\nAuthors: Fielden, J.; Siegner, S. M.; Gallagher, D. N.; Schroeder, M.; Dello Stritto, M. R.; Kobel, L.; Schlapansky, M.; Cejka, P.; Jost, M.; Corn, J. E.\nScore: 30.4, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553865\nThe DNA damage response (DDR) is a multi-faceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability. Unraveling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge. Here, we comprehensively mapped genetic interactions for all core DDR genes using combinatorial CRISPRi screening. We discovered myriad new connections, including interactions between cancer genes and small molecule targets. We focused on two of the strongest interactions: FEN1/LIG1:WDR48 and FANCM:SMARCAL1. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain overactive translesion synthesis in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells, and that a preclinical inhibitor of USP1 specifically kills FEN1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM suppress DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation at TA-rich repeats in late replicating regions that otherwise escape into mitosis and cause nuclear fragmentation. We present fundamental insights into genome maintenance processes and our dataset provides a springboard for mechanistic investigations into connections between DDR factors and suggests multiple interactions that could be exploited in cancer therapy.\nTriaging of -helical proteins to the mitochondrial outer membrane by distinct chaperone machinery based on substrate topology\nAuthors: Muthukumar, G.; Stevens, T. A.; Inglis, A. J.; Esantsi, T. K.; Saunders, R. A.; Schulte, F.; Voorhees, R. M.; Guna, A.; Weissman, J. S.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553624\nMitochondrial outer membrane -helical proteins play critical roles in mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, but the rules governing the targeting and insertion of these biophysically diverse substrates remain unknown. Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse -helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways which act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for efficient targeting of polytopic proteins whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a novel cytosolic chaperone which physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.\nEndogenous BAX and BAK form mosaic rings of variable size and composition on apoptotic mitochondria\nAuthors: Schweighofer, S. V.; Jans, D. C.; Keller-Findeisen, J.; Folmeg, A.; Bates, M.; Jakobs, S.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553869\nOne hallmark of apoptosis is the oligomerization of BAX and BAK to form a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates the release of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol. Cells overexpressing BAX or BAK fusion proteins are a powerful model system to study the dynamics and localization of these proteins in cells. However, it is unclear whether overexpressed BAX and BAK form the same ultrastructural assemblies following the same temporal hierarchy as endogenously expressed proteins. Combining live- and fixed-cell STED super-resolution microscopy, we show that overexpression of BAK results in novel BAK structures, which are virtually absent in non-overexpressing apoptotic cells. We further demonstrate that in wildtype cells, BAK is recruited to apoptotic pores before BAX. Both proteins together form unordered, mosaic rings on apoptotic mitochondria in immortalized cell culture models as well as in human primary cells. In BAX- or BAK- single-knockout cells, the remaining protein is able to form rings independently. The heterogeneous nature of these rings corroborates the toroidal apoptotic pore model.\nTip60-mediated Rheb acetylation links palmitic acid with mTORC1 activation and insulin resistance\nAuthors: Zhao, Z.; Chen, Q.; Xiang, X.; Dai, W.; Fang, W.; Cui, K.; Li, B.; Liu, Q.; Liu, Y.; Shen, Y.; Li, Y.; Xu, W.; Mai, K.; Ai, Q.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553816\nDifferences in dietary fatty acid saturation impact glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vertebrates. Excess dietary intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induces glucose intolerance and metabolic disorders. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) elicit beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. However, it remains elusive how SFAs and UFAs signal differentially toward insulin signaling to influence glucose homeostasis. Here, using a croaker model, we report that dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid or linoleic acid, leads to dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling which provokes systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, using croaker primary myocytes, mouse C2C12 myotubes and HEK293T cells, we show that PA-induced mTORC1 activation is dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid ? oxidation. Notably, PA profoundly elevates acetyl-CoA derived from mitochondrial fatty acid ? oxidation which intensifies Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation. Subsequently, the induction of Rheb acetylation facilitates hyperactivation of mTORC1 which enhances serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and simultaneously inhibits transcription of IRS1 through impeding TFEB nuclear translocation, leading to impairment of insulin signaling. Furthermore, targeted abrogation of acetyl-CoA produced from fatty acid oxidation or Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation by pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown rescues PA-induced insulin resistance. Collectively, this study reveals a conserved acetylation-dependent mechanistic insight for understanding the link between fatty acids and insulin resistance, which may provide a potential therapeutic avenue to intervene in the development of T2D.\nF-box protein FBXB-65 regulates anterograde transport of UNC-104 through modification near the PH domain\nAuthors: Sabharwal, V.; Boyanapalli, S. P. P.; Shee, A.; Nonet, M. L.; Nandi, A.; Chaudhuri, D.; Koushika, S. P.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553108\nAxonal transport is essential for cargo movement between the neuronal cell body and synapses. UNC-104/KIF1A, a Kinesin-3 motor in C. elegans that anterogradely transports precursors of synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), is known to be degraded at synapses through the ubiquitin pathway. Knockdown of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, uba-1, leads to increased accumulation of UNC-104 at neuronal ends and at synapses of touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Loss of the F-box protein FBXB-65, a putative E3 ligase, leads to UNC-104 accumulation at distal ends of neurons, alters net anterograde movement of UNC-104, and the intensity of moving UNC-104 puncta likely bound to cargo without changes in synaptic UNC-104 levels. Using a theoretical model, we analyze the steady state distribution of the anterogradely moving UNC-104 motor. A good agreement between the model and the experimental distributions leads to a crucial hypothesis that UNC-104 may exhibit cooperative binding with moving motor puncta likely associated with cargo, which is regulated by fbxb-65. FBXB-65 regulates the modification of UNC-104 motor in a region besides the cargo binding PH-domain. Both fbxb-65 and UNC-104 motor independent of FBXB-65 regulate the extent of cargo transport in the axon and transport behaviour of cargo at branch points. Our study shows that modification of UNC-104 near its cargo-binding domain may regulate number of motors on the cargo surface and this regulation can fine-tune cargo transport to its destination, the synapse.\nThe pore-forming apolipoprotein APOL7C drives phagosomal rupture and antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells\nAuthors: Gonzales, G. A.; Huang, S.; Rajwani, J.; Wilkinson, L.; Nguyen, J. A.; Wood, C. M.; Moore, M.; Cedeno, E.; Sikdar, S.; McKenna, N.; Ebacher, V.; Rosin, N. L.; Carneiro, M. B.; Surewaard, B.; Peters, N. C.; Biernaskie, J.; Mahoney, D. J.; Yates, R. M.; Canton, J.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553042\nType I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are essential for the generation of protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against many types of viruses and tumours. They do so by internalizing antigens from virally infected or tumour cells and presenting them to CD8+ T cells in a process known as cross-presentation (XP). Despite the obvious biological importance of XP, the molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unclear. Here, we show that a cDC-specific pore-forming protein called apolipoprotein 7C (APOL7C) is upregulated in response to innate immune stimuli and is recruited to phagosomes. Strikingly, the association of APOL7C with phagosomes leads to phagosomal rupture, which in turn allows for the escape of engulfed protein antigens to the cytosol where they can be processed via the endogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing pathway. We show that APOL7C recruitment to phagosomes is voltage-dependent and occurs in response to NADPH oxidase-induced depolarization of the phagosomal membrane. Our data indicate the presence of dedicated pore-forming apolipoproteins that mediate the delivery of phagocytosed proteins to the cytosol of activated cDC1s to facilitate MHC class I presentation of exogenous antigen and to regulate adaptive immunity.\nRadical differences between two FLIM microscopes affect interpretation of cell signaling dynamics\nAuthors: Mukherjee, S.; Klarenbeek, J.; El Oualid, F.; van den Broek, B.; Jalink, K.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553714\nEmerging evidence suggests that cell signaling outcomes depend not only on the signal strength but also on its temporal progression. Our lab employs Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Resonance Energy Transfer (FLIM/FRET) biosensors to study intracellular signaling dynamics. We studied activation of {beta}1 receptors by Isoproterenol, which triggers cAMP signaling via the G protein Gs, using two different FLIM microscopes: a widefield frequency domain FLIM (fdFLIM) setup and a fast confocal Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) setup. When comparing results from each FLIM setup, unexpectedly we obtained distinctively different cAMP kinetics: fdFLIM recording of cAMP in HeLa and Cos7 cells yielded transient responses, reminiscent of rapid receptor desensitization, while TCSPC recordings exhibited sustained responses lasting over 30 minutes. We initially suspected phototoxicity due to the intense light locally in the laser focus spot in confocal microscopy to interfere with normal termination of signal transduction and set out to map photosensitive steps in the signaling cascade in detail. We find no evidence for light-sensitivity in either generation or breakdown of cAMP, but rather, our findings show that the kinetic differences are due to selective degradation of {beta}1 agonists on the fdFLIM setup. Agonist degradation appeared due to the commercial FluoroBrite medium, even though this has been specifically advertised to lower phototoxicity and reduce autofluorescence. Mass spectrometry identified Folic acid, an undisclosed constituent of FluoroBrite, as the culprit leading to artifacts in fdFLIM measurements. In all, our study underscores the impact of subtle phototoxicity effects on experimental outcome, and it shows that in this case confocal TCSPC provides the more reliable data needed to study response kinetics. This work also emphasizes the it is crucial that scientific vendors fully disclose chemical formulations.\nMultivalent GU-rich oligonucleotides sequester TDP-43 in the nucleus by inducing high molecular weight RNP complexes\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Das, T.; Kalab, P.; Hayes, L. R.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551528\nThe loss of nuclear TDP-43 localization and its accumulation in cytoplasmic aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegeneration and major therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that TDP-43 binding to endogenous nuclear GU-rich RNAs sequesters TDP-43 in the nucleus and restricts its passive nuclear export. Here, we tested the feasibility of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide-mediated augmentation of TDP-43 nuclear localization. Using biochemical assays, we compared the ability of GU-rich oligonucleotides to engage in multivalent, RRM-dependent binding with TDP-43 and identified (GU)16 as a strong multivalent binder. When transfected into cells, unlike monovalent oligonucleotides that displaced TDP-43 from the nucleus, (GU)16 preserved steady-state TDP-43 nuclear localization and prevented transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 mislocalization. RNA pulldowns from (GU)16-transfected cells confirmed that (GU)16 induced high molecular weight RNP complexes, incorporating TDP-43 and possibly other GU-binding proteins. Transfected (GU)16 caused partial failure of TDP-43 cryptic exon repression, likely because the high-affinity oligonucleotides diverted TDP-43 from endogenous RNAs. Thus, while GU-rich oligonucleotides can attenuate TDP-43 mislocalization, optimization is needed to avoid TDP-43 loss of function.\nEpithelial cell chirality emerges through the dynamic concentric pattern of actomyosin cytoskeleton\nAuthors: Yamamoto, T.; Ishibashi, T.; Mimori-Kiyosue, Y.; Hiver, S.; Tokushige, N.; Tarama, M.; Takeichi, M.; Shibata, T.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553476\nThe chirality of tissues and organs is essential for their function and development. Tissue-level chirality derives from the chirality of individual cells that comprise the tissue, and cellular chirality is considered to emerge through the organization of chiral molecules within the cell. However, the principle of how molecular chirality leads to cellular chirality is still unclear. To address this question, we experimentally studied the chiral behaviors of isolated epithelial cells derived from a carcinoma line and developed a theoretical understanding of how their behaviors arise from molecular-level chirality. We first found that the nucleus rotates, and the cytoplasm circulates in a clockwise direction in a cell. During the rotation, actin and myosin IIA are organized into stress fibers with a vortex-like chiral orientation at the ventral side of the cell periphery, simultaneously forming thin filaments with a concentric orientation at the dorsal level of the cell. Lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that these concentric filaments moved in a clockwise direction, suggesting their potential involvement in the rotation of intracellular components. On the other hand, when stress fibers with chiral orientations were removed by drug treatment, cells still exhibited intracellular rotation, implying that the cells generate rotational force without any macroscopic cell-scale chiral orientational order of the cytoskeleton. To elucidate how concentric actomyosin filaments induce chiral rotation, we analyzed a hydrodynamic model considering the microscopic chirality of actomyosin filaments. Our experiments and theory suggest that cell chirality emerges driven by the microscopic chirality of actomyosin rather than the macroscopic chiral orientational order. Significance statementCell chirality, the fundamental asymmetry of cells, originates from molecular chirality, and plays a crucial role in establishing the left-right asymmetry of organs and tissues. Active torque induced by the cytoskeleton has been implicated in the mechanism behind cell chirality. However, the precise organization of molecular-scale torque driving cell chirality remains elusive. In our study, we observed a clockwise rotational motion of the nucleus and cytoplasm in singly isolated epithelial cells derived from a colorectal carcinoma line. Our investigation suggests that the non-chiral structure formed by actin and myosin II is responsible for driving cell chirality. Our theory, based on active hydrodynamics, further suggests that the concentric orientation of actomyosin induces the clockwise cytoplasmic flow.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a highly regulated process that involves a dynamic, three-step enzymatic cascade, where more than 600 E3 ligases play a critical role in recognizing specific substrates for modification. Separating bona fide targets of E3s from E3-interacting proteins remains a major challenge in the field. In this study, we present BioE3, a novel approach for identifying substrates of ubiquitin-like (UbL) E3 ligases of interest. Using BirA-E3 ligase fusion proteins and bioUbLs, the method facilitates site-specific biotinylation of UbL-modified substrates of particular E3s for proteomic identification. We demonstrate that the BioE3 system can identify both known and novel targets of two RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases: RNF4, known to be involved in DNA damage 36 response and the regulation of PML nuclear bodies, and MIB1, implicated in endocytosis, autophagy, and centrosomal protein homeostasis. We further show the versatility of BioE3 by identifying targets of an organelle-specific E3 (MARCH5) and a relatively uncharacterized E3 (RNF214). Furthermore, we show that BioE3 works with HECT-type E3 ligases and identify novel targets of NEDD4 involved in vesicular trafficking. BioE3 is a powerful tool that enables identification of bona fide substrates of UbL E3 ligases and how they change with chemical perturbations. BioE3 may also be applicable for UbLs beyond Ub and SUMO, as well as other E3 ligase classes. The resulting knowledge can shed light on the regulation of cellular processes by the complex UbL network and provide information useful for strategies such as targeted protein degradation (TPD), advancing our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and their applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The DNA damage response (DDR) is a multi-faceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability. Unraveling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge. Here, we comprehensively mapped genetic interactions for all core DDR genes using combinatorial CRISPRi screening. We discovered myriad new connections, including interactions between cancer genes and small molecule targets. We focused on two of the strongest interactions: FEN1/LIG1:WDR48 and FANCM:SMARCAL1. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain overactive translesion synthesis in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells, and that a preclinical inhibitor of USP1 specifically kills FEN1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM suppress DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation at TA-rich repeats in late replicating regions that otherwise escape into mitosis and cause nuclear fragmentation. We present fundamental insights into genome maintenance processes and our dataset provides a springboard for mechanistic investigations into connections between DDR factors and suggests multiple interactions that could be exploited in cancer therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial outer membrane -helical proteins play critical roles in mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, but the rules governing the targeting and insertion of these biophysically diverse substrates remain unknown. Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse -helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways which act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for efficient targeting of polytopic proteins whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a novel cytosolic chaperone which physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One hallmark of apoptosis is the oligomerization of BAX and BAK to form a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates the release of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol. Cells overexpressing BAX or BAK fusion proteins are a powerful model system to study the dynamics and localization of these proteins in cells. However, it is unclear whether overexpressed BAX and BAK form the same ultrastructural assemblies following the same temporal hierarchy as endogenously expressed proteins. Combining live- and fixed-cell STED super-resolution microscopy, we show that overexpression of BAK results in novel BAK structures, which are virtually absent in non-overexpressing apoptotic cells. We further demonstrate that in wildtype cells, BAK is recruited to apoptotic pores before BAX. Both proteins together form unordered, mosaic rings on apoptotic mitochondria in immortalized cell culture models as well as in human primary cells. In BAX- or BAK- single-knockout cells, the remaining protein is able to form rings independently. The heterogeneous nature of these rings corroborates the toroidal apoptotic pore model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Differences in dietary fatty acid saturation impact glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vertebrates. Excess dietary intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induces glucose intolerance and metabolic disorders. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) elicit beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. However, it remains elusive how SFAs and UFAs signal differentially toward insulin signaling to influence glucose homeostasis. Here, using a croaker model, we report that dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid or linoleic acid, leads to dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling which provokes systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, using croaker primary myocytes, mouse C2C12 myotubes and HEK293T cells, we show that PA-induced mTORC1 activation is dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid ? oxidation. Notably, PA profoundly elevates acetyl-CoA derived from mitochondrial fatty acid ? oxidation which intensifies Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation. Subsequently, the induction of Rheb acetylation facilitates hyperactivation of mTORC1 which enhances serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and simultaneously inhibits transcription of IRS1 through impeding TFEB nuclear translocation, leading to impairment of insulin signaling. Furthermore, targeted abrogation of acetyl-CoA produced from fatty acid oxidation or Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation by pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown rescues PA-induced insulin resistance. Collectively, this study reveals a conserved acetylation-dependent mechanistic insight for understanding the link between fatty acids and insulin resistance, which may provide a potential therapeutic avenue to intervene in the development of T2D.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Axonal transport is essential for cargo movement between the neuronal cell body and synapses. UNC-104/KIF1A, a Kinesin-3 motor in C. elegans that anterogradely transports precursors of synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), is known to be degraded at synapses through the ubiquitin pathway. Knockdown of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, uba-1, leads to increased accumulation of UNC-104 at neuronal ends and at synapses of touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Loss of the F-box protein FBXB-65, a putative E3 ligase, leads to UNC-104 accumulation at distal ends of neurons, alters net anterograde movement of UNC-104, and the intensity of moving UNC-104 puncta likely bound to cargo without changes in synaptic UNC-104 levels. Using a theoretical model, we analyze the steady state distribution of the anterogradely moving UNC-104 motor. A good agreement between the model and the experimental distributions leads to a crucial hypothesis that UNC-104 may exhibit cooperative binding with moving motor puncta likely associated with cargo, which is regulated by fbxb-65. FBXB-65 regulates the modification of UNC-104 motor in a region besides the cargo binding PH-domain. Both fbxb-65 and UNC-104 motor independent of FBXB-65 regulate the extent of cargo transport in the axon and transport behaviour of cargo at branch points. Our study shows that modification of UNC-104 near its cargo-binding domain may regulate number of motors on the cargo surface and this regulation can fine-tune cargo transport to its destination, the synapse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are essential for the generation of protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against many types of viruses and tumours. They do so by internalizing antigens from virally infected or tumour cells and presenting them to CD8&#43; T cells in a process known as cross-presentation (XP). Despite the obvious biological importance of XP, the molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unclear. Here, we show that a cDC-specific pore-forming protein called apolipoprotein 7C (APOL7C) is upregulated in response to innate immune stimuli and is recruited to phagosomes. Strikingly, the association of APOL7C with phagosomes leads to phagosomal rupture, which in turn allows for the escape of engulfed protein antigens to the cytosol where they can be processed via the endogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing pathway. We show that APOL7C recruitment to phagosomes is voltage-dependent and occurs in response to NADPH oxidase-induced depolarization of the phagosomal membrane. Our data indicate the presence of dedicated pore-forming apolipoproteins that mediate the delivery of phagocytosed proteins to the cytosol of activated cDC1s to facilitate MHC class I presentation of exogenous antigen and to regulate adaptive immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emerging evidence suggests that cell signaling outcomes depend not only on the signal strength but also on its temporal progression. Our lab employs Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Resonance Energy Transfer (FLIM/FRET) biosensors to study intracellular signaling dynamics. We studied activation of {beta}1 receptors by Isoproterenol, which triggers cAMP signaling via the G protein Gs, using two different FLIM microscopes: a widefield frequency domain FLIM (fdFLIM) setup and a fast confocal Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) setup. When comparing results from each FLIM setup, unexpectedly we obtained distinctively different cAMP kinetics: fdFLIM recording of cAMP in HeLa and Cos7 cells yielded transient responses, reminiscent of rapid receptor desensitization, while TCSPC recordings exhibited sustained responses lasting over 30 minutes. We initially suspected phototoxicity due to the intense light locally in the laser focus spot in confocal microscopy to interfere with normal termination of signal transduction and set out to map photosensitive steps in the signaling cascade in detail. We find no evidence for light-sensitivity in either generation or breakdown of cAMP, but rather, our findings show that the kinetic differences are due to selective degradation of {beta}1 agonists on the fdFLIM setup. Agonist degradation appeared due to the commercial FluoroBrite medium, even though this has been specifically advertised to lower phototoxicity and reduce autofluorescence. Mass spectrometry identified Folic acid, an undisclosed constituent of FluoroBrite, as the culprit leading to artifacts in fdFLIM measurements. In all, our study underscores the impact of subtle phototoxicity effects on experimental outcome, and it shows that in this case confocal TCSPC provides the more reliable data needed to study response kinetics. This work also emphasizes the it is crucial that scientific vendors fully disclose chemical formulations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The loss of nuclear TDP-43 localization and its accumulation in cytoplasmic aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegeneration and major therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that TDP-43 binding to endogenous nuclear GU-rich RNAs sequesters TDP-43 in the nucleus and restricts its passive nuclear export. Here, we tested the feasibility of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide-mediated augmentation of TDP-43 nuclear localization. Using biochemical assays, we compared the ability of GU-rich oligonucleotides to engage in multivalent, RRM-dependent binding with TDP-43 and identified (GU)16 as a strong multivalent binder. When transfected into cells, unlike monovalent oligonucleotides that displaced TDP-43 from the nucleus, (GU)16 preserved steady-state TDP-43 nuclear localization and prevented transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 mislocalization. RNA pulldowns from (GU)16-transfected cells confirmed that (GU)16 induced high molecular weight RNP complexes, incorporating TDP-43 and possibly other GU-binding proteins. Transfected (GU)16 caused partial failure of TDP-43 cryptic exon repression, likely because the high-affinity oligonucleotides diverted TDP-43 from endogenous RNAs. Thus, while GU-rich oligonucleotides can attenuate TDP-43 mislocalization, optimization is needed to avoid TDP-43 loss of function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The chirality of tissues and organs is essential for their function and development. Tissue-level chirality derives from the chirality of individual cells that comprise the tissue, and cellular chirality is considered to emerge through the organization of chiral molecules within the cell. However, the principle of how molecular chirality leads to cellular chirality is still unclear. To address this question, we experimentally studied the chiral behaviors of isolated epithelial cells derived from a carcinoma line and developed a theoretical understanding of how their behaviors arise from molecular-level chirality. We first found that the nucleus rotates, and the cytoplasm circulates in a clockwise direction in a cell. During the rotation, actin and myosin IIA are organized into stress fibers with a vortex-like chiral orientation at the ventral side of the cell periphery, simultaneously forming thin filaments with a concentric orientation at the dorsal level of the cell. Lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that these concentric filaments moved in a clockwise direction, suggesting their potential involvement in the rotation of intracellular components. On the other hand, when stress fibers with chiral orientations were removed by drug treatment, cells still exhibited intracellular rotation, implying that the cells generate rotational force without any macroscopic cell-scale chiral orientational order of the cytoskeleton. To elucidate how concentric actomyosin filaments induce chiral rotation, we analyzed a hydrodynamic model considering the microscopic chirality of actomyosin filaments. Our experiments and theory suggest that cell chirality emerges driven by the microscopic chirality of actomyosin rather than the macroscopic chiral orientational order.

Significance statementCell chirality, the fundamental asymmetry of cells, originates from molecular chirality, and plays a crucial role in establishing the left-right asymmetry of organs and tissues. Active torque induced by the cytoskeleton has been implicated in the mechanism behind cell chirality. However, the precise organization of molecular-scale torque driving cell chirality remains elusive. In our study, we observed a clockwise rotational motion of the nucleus and cytoplasm in singly isolated epithelial cells derived from a colorectal carcinoma line. Our investigation suggests that the non-chiral structure formed by actin and myosin II is responsible for driving cell chirality. Our theory, based on active hydrodynamics, further suggests that the concentric orientation of actomyosin induces the clockwise cytoplasmic flow.</p>
