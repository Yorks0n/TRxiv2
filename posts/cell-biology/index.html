K.\nScore: 50.8, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559261\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly hydrated, three-dimensional network composed of various macromolecules and signaling factors. It serves as a structural scaffold for cells and plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Despite its importance in metazoans, structural knowledge is rudimentary on how the components of the matrisome are secreted, remodeled, and interact with each other and with surrounding cells. Specifically, the exact molecular assembly of important ECM fibers, such as fibronectin fibrils, fibrillin microfibrils, or Collagen-VI filaments has remained enigmatic. This is largely due to methodological limitations in specimen preparation for conventional room-temperature electron microscopy (EM). To overcome these limitations, we have developed a cell culture-based 3D-ECM platform compatible with sample thinning by cryo-lift out focused ion beam (FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our workflow involves the implementation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) grown on EM grids, resulting in a highly adaptable and versatile tool to closely mimic ECM environments. This allows us to visualize native ECM and its components for the first time in their fully hydrated, cellular context. Our data reveals an intricate network of ECM fibers and their positioning with respect to matrix-secreting cells. In addition to D-spaced collagen fibers, we visualize previously unresolved fibrous structures, and an amorphous matrix co-assembling in proximity to ECM fibers and delineating the boundary between ECM and empty extra-cellular space. Intra- and extracellular granules presumably represent assembly intermediates of the ECM. Our results add to the structural atlas of the ECM and provide novel insights into ECM secretion, assembly and maintenance.\nContact-FP: a dimerization-dependent fluorescent protein toolkit for visualizing membrane contact site dynamics\nAuthors: Miner, G. E.; Smith, S. Y.; Showalter, W. K.; So, C. M.; Ragusa, J. V.; Powers, A. E.; Zanellati, M. C.; Hsu, C.-H.; Marchan, M. F.; Cohen, S.\nScore: 50.5, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559820\nMembrane contact sites (MCSs) are sites of close apposition between two organelles used to exchange ions, lipids, and information. Cells respond to changing environmental or developmental conditions by modulating the number, extent, or duration of MCSs. Because of their small size and dynamic nature, tools to study the dynamics of MCSs in live cells have been limited. Dimerization-dependent fluorescent proteins (ddFPs) targeted to organelle membranes are an ideal tool for studying MCS dynamics because they reversibly interact to fluoresce specifically at the interface between two organelles. Here, we build on previous work using ddFPs as sensors to visualize the morphology and dynamics of MCSs. We engineered a suite of ddFPs called Contact-FP that targets ddFP monomers to lipid droplets (LDs), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane, caveolae, and the cytoplasm. We show that these probes correctly localize to their target organelles. Using LDs as a test case, we demonstrate that Contact-FP pairs specifically localize to the interface between two target organelles. Titration of LD-mitochondria ddFPs revealed that these sensors can be used at high concentrations to drive MCSs or can be titrated down to minimally perturb and visualize endogenous MCSs. We show that Contact-FP probes can be used to: (1) visualize LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics, (2) observe changes in LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics upon overexpression of PLIN5, a known LD-mitochondrial tether, and (3) visualize two MCSs that share one organelle simultaneously (e.g., LD-mitochondria and LD-ER MCSs). Contact-FP probes can be optimized to visualize MCSs between any pair of organelles represented in the toolkit.\nA Window into Mammalian Basement Membrane Development: Insights from the mTurq2-Col4a1 Mouse Model\nAuthors: Jones, R. A.; Trejo, B.; Sil, P.; Little, K. A.; Pasolli, H. A.; Joyce, B.; Posfai, E.; Devenport, D.\nScore: 30.8, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559396\nBasement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The inherent pliability of the BM enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.\nThe anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation and expression of embryo-fetal globin genes in human erythroleukemia K562 cells\nAuthors: Zurlo, M.; Gasparello, J.; Verona, M.; Papi, C.; Cosenza, L. C.; Finotti, A.; Marzaro, G.; Gambari, R.\nScore: 991.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556634\nThe COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.\nControl of mitophagy initiation and progression by the TBK1 adaptors NAP1 and SINTBAD\nAuthors: Adriaenssens, E.; Nguyen, T. N.; Sawa-Makarska, J.; Khuu, G.; Schuschnig, M.; Shoebridge, S.; Watts, E. M.; Csalyi, K. D.; Padman, B. S.; Lazarou, M.; Martens, S.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559255\nMitophagy preserves overall mitochondrial fitness by selectively targeting damaged mitochondria for degradation. The regulatory mechanisms that prevent PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and other selective autophagy pathways from overreacting while ensuring swift progression once initiated are largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate how the TBK1 adaptors NAP1 and SINTBAD restrict the initiation of OPTN-driven mitophagy by competing with OPTN for TBK1. Conversely, they promote the progression of NDP52-driven mitophagy by recruiting TBK1 to NDP52 and stabilizing its interaction with FIP200. Notably, OPTN emerges as the primary recruiter of TBK1 during mitophagy initiation, which in return boosts NDP52-mediated mitophagy. Our results thus define NAP1 and SINTBAD as cargo receptor rheostats, elevating the threshold for mitophagy initiation by OPTN while promoting the progression of the pathway once set in motion by supporting NDP52. These findings shed light on the cellular strategy to prevent pathway hyperactivity while still ensuring efficient progression.\nStructural basis of lipid head group entry to the Kennedy pathway by FLVCR1\nAuthors: Son, Y.; Kenny, T. C.; Khan, A.; Birsoy, K.; Hite, R. K.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560019\nPhosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively. Despite the importance of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here, we show that FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome PCARP, transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprised of aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, the larger quaternary amine of choline interacts differently with FLVCR1 than does the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are critical for the transport of ethanolamine, while being dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLCVR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway.\nLRRK2 kinase dependent and independent function on endolysosomal repair promotes macrophage cell death\nAuthors: Morrison, R.; Mihaylov, S. R. G.; Luk, C. H.; Rodgers, A.; Athanasiadi, N.; Morris, H.; Pellegrino, E.; Ultanir, S. K.; Gutierrez, M. G.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559807\nLRRK2 is commonly mutated in Parkinsons disease and has cell type-specific mechanisms of activation and function. In macrophages, LRRK2 is associated with lysosomes and is activated following lysosomal damage. However, effects of pathogenic LRRK2-G2019S in macrophages are unknown. Here, using primary mouse and human iPSC-derived macrophage (iPSDM) models of LRRK2-G2019S, we defined the substrates of LRRK2 after lysosomal damage. Using phosphoproteomics we found that LRRK2-G2019S and wild-type macrophages showed similar levels of Rab phosphorylation after lysosomal damage, with the exceptions of Rab12 and Rab35, which were increased and decreased, respectively, in LRRK2-G2019S. LRRK2-G2019S macrophages showed a LRRK2 kinase activity-independent deficit in lysosomal membrane repair which resulted in more cell death and increased apoptosis. Importantly, we recapitulated this phenotype in iPSDM from patients carrying the G2019S mutation, but not in isogenic control iPSDM. Altogether, we define here the signaling downstream of G2019S in macrophages and identify susceptibility to cell death after lysosomal damage as an important phenotype of this mutation.\nOrganelle landscape analysis using a multi-parametric particle-based method\nAuthors: Kurikawa, Y.; Koyama-Honda, I.; Igarashi, K.; Tamura, N.; Koike, S.; Mizushima, N.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559448\nOrganelles have unique structures and molecular compositions for their functions and have been classified accordingly. However, many organelles are heterogeneous and in the process of maturation and differentiation. Because traditional methods have a limited number of parameters and spatial resolution, they struggle to capture the heterogeneous landscapes of organelles. Here, we present a method for multi-parametric particle-based analysis of organelles. After disrupting cells, fluorescence microscopy images of organelle particles labeled with six to eight different organelle markers were obtained, and their multi-dimensional data were represented in intuitive two-dimensional UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection) spaces. This method enabled visualization of landscapes of seven major organelles as well as the transitional states of endocytic organelles directed to the recycling and degradation pathways. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites were detected in these maps. Our proposed method successfully detects a wide array of organelles simultaneously, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous organelle landscapes.\nCytoplasmic fluidization triggers breaking spore dormancy in fission yeast.\nAuthors: Sakai, K.; Kondo, Y.; Goto, Y.; Aoki, K.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559686\nThe cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules (-3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking.\nMitochondrial outer membrane integrity regulates a ubiquitin-dependent NF-κB inflammatory response\nAuthors: Vringer, E.; Riley, J.; Black, A.; Cloix, C.; Lilla, S.; Walczak, H.; Gyrd-Hansen, M.; Huang, D.; Zanivan, S.; Tait, S.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558776\nMitochondria are often essential for apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This central event enables cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation and rapid cell death. Recently, MOMP has been shown to be inherently pro-inflammatory, for instance, by enabling mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Alongside having emerging functions in health and disease, MOMP associated inflammation can also elicit anti-tumour immunity. Nonetheless, how MOMP triggers inflammation and how the cell counteracts this remains poorly defined. We find that upon MOMP, mitochondria are ubiquitylated in a promiscuous manner targeting proteins localised to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial ubiquitylation serves to recruit the essential adaptor molecule, NEMO, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory NF-{kappa}B signalling. We find that disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through different means leads to engagement of a similar pro-inflammatory signalling platform. Thus, mitochondrial integrity directly controls inflammation, such that permeabilised mitochondria initiate NF-{kappa}B signalling. This event may be important for the various pathophysiological functions of MOMP-associated inflammation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly hydrated, three-dimensional network composed of various macromolecules and signaling factors. It serves as a structural scaffold for cells and plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Despite its importance in metazoans, structural knowledge is rudimentary on how the components of the matrisome are secreted, remodeled, and interact with each other and with surrounding cells. Specifically, the exact molecular assembly of important ECM fibers, such as fibronectin fibrils, fibrillin microfibrils, or Collagen-VI filaments has remained enigmatic. This is largely due to methodological limitations in specimen preparation for conventional room-temperature electron microscopy (EM).

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a cell culture-based 3D-ECM platform compatible with sample thinning by cryo-lift out focused ion beam (FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our workflow involves the implementation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) grown on EM grids, resulting in a highly adaptable and versatile tool to closely mimic ECM environments. This allows us to visualize native ECM and its components for the first time in their fully hydrated, cellular context. Our data reveals an intricate network of ECM fibers and their positioning with respect to matrix-secreting cells. In addition to D-spaced collagen fibers, we visualize previously unresolved fibrous structures, and an amorphous matrix co-assembling in proximity to ECM fibers and delineating the boundary between ECM and empty extra-cellular space. Intra- and extracellular granules presumably represent assembly intermediates of the ECM. Our results add to the structural atlas of the ECM and provide novel insights into ECM secretion, assembly and maintenance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are sites of close apposition between two organelles used to exchange ions, lipids, and information. Cells respond to changing environmental or developmental conditions by modulating the number, extent, or duration of MCSs. Because of their small size and dynamic nature, tools to study the dynamics of MCSs in live cells have been limited. Dimerization-dependent fluorescent proteins (ddFPs) targeted to organelle membranes are an ideal tool for studying MCS dynamics because they reversibly interact to fluoresce specifically at the interface between two organelles. Here, we build on previous work using ddFPs as sensors to visualize the morphology and dynamics of MCSs. We engineered a suite of ddFPs called Contact-FP that targets ddFP monomers to lipid droplets (LDs), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane, caveolae, and the cytoplasm. We show that these probes correctly localize to their target organelles. Using LDs as a test case, we demonstrate that Contact-FP pairs specifically localize to the interface between two target organelles. Titration of LD-mitochondria ddFPs revealed that these sensors can be used at high concentrations to drive MCSs or can be titrated down to minimally perturb and visualize endogenous MCSs. We show that Contact-FP probes can be used to: (1) visualize LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics, (2) observe changes in LD-mitochondria MCS dynamics upon overexpression of PLIN5, a known LD-mitochondrial tether, and (3) visualize two MCSs that share one organelle simultaneously (e.g., LD-mitochondria and LD-ER MCSs). Contact-FP probes can be optimized to visualize MCSs between any pair of organelles represented in the toolkit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The inherent pliability of the BM enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitophagy preserves overall mitochondrial fitness by selectively targeting damaged mitochondria for degradation. The regulatory mechanisms that prevent PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and other selective autophagy pathways from overreacting while ensuring swift progression once initiated are largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate how the TBK1 adaptors NAP1 and SINTBAD restrict the initiation of OPTN-driven mitophagy by competing with OPTN for TBK1. Conversely, they promote the progression of NDP52-driven mitophagy by recruiting TBK1 to NDP52 and stabilizing its interaction with FIP200. Notably, OPTN emerges as the primary recruiter of TBK1 during mitophagy initiation, which in return boosts NDP52-mediated mitophagy. Our results thus define NAP1 and SINTBAD as cargo receptor rheostats, elevating the threshold for mitophagy initiation by OPTN while promoting the progression of the pathway once set in motion by supporting NDP52. These findings shed light on the cellular strategy to prevent pathway hyperactivity while still ensuring efficient progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively. Despite the importance of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here, we show that FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome PCARP, transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprised of aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, the larger quaternary amine of choline interacts differently with FLVCR1 than does the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are critical for the transport of ethanolamine, while being dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLCVR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway.</p>

        <p class="abstract">LRRK2 is commonly mutated in Parkinsons disease and has cell type-specific mechanisms of activation and function. In macrophages, LRRK2 is associated with lysosomes and is activated following lysosomal damage. However, effects of pathogenic LRRK2-G2019S in macrophages are unknown. Here, using primary mouse and human iPSC-derived macrophage (iPSDM) models of LRRK2-G2019S, we defined the substrates of LRRK2 after lysosomal damage. Using phosphoproteomics we found that LRRK2-G2019S and wild-type macrophages showed similar levels of Rab phosphorylation after lysosomal damage, with the exceptions of Rab12 and Rab35, which were increased and decreased, respectively, in LRRK2-G2019S. LRRK2-G2019S macrophages showed a LRRK2 kinase activity-independent deficit in lysosomal membrane repair which resulted in more cell death and increased apoptosis. Importantly, we recapitulated this phenotype in iPSDM from patients carrying the G2019S mutation, but not in isogenic control iPSDM. Altogether, we define here the signaling downstream of G2019S in macrophages and identify susceptibility to cell death after lysosomal damage as an important phenotype of this mutation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organelles have unique structures and molecular compositions for their functions and have been classified accordingly. However, many organelles are heterogeneous and in the process of maturation and differentiation. Because traditional methods have a limited number of parameters and spatial resolution, they struggle to capture the heterogeneous landscapes of organelles. Here, we present a method for multi-parametric particle-based analysis of organelles. After disrupting cells, fluorescence microscopy images of organelle particles labeled with six to eight different organelle markers were obtained, and their multi-dimensional data were represented in intuitive two-dimensional UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection) spaces. This method enabled visualization of landscapes of seven major organelles as well as the transitional states of endocytic organelles directed to the recycling and degradation pathways. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites were detected in these maps. Our proposed method successfully detects a wide array of organelles simultaneously, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous organelle landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules (-3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria are often essential for apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This central event enables cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation and rapid cell death. Recently, MOMP has been shown to be inherently pro-inflammatory, for instance, by enabling mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Alongside having emerging functions in health and disease, MOMP associated inflammation can also elicit anti-tumour immunity. Nonetheless, how MOMP triggers inflammation and how the cell counteracts this remains poorly defined. We find that upon MOMP, mitochondria are ubiquitylated in a promiscuous manner targeting proteins localised to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial ubiquitylation serves to recruit the essential adaptor molecule, NEMO, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory NF-{kappa}B signalling. We find that disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through different means leads to engagement of a similar pro-inflammatory signalling platform. Thus, mitochondrial integrity directly controls inflammation, such that permeabilised mitochondria initiate NF-{kappa}B signalling. This event may be important for the various pathophysiological functions of MOMP-associated inflammation.</p>
