Bacteriophages of the family Chimalliviridae sequester their genomes within a phagegenerated organelle, the phage nucleus, which is enclosed by a lattice of viral protein ChmA. Using the dRfxCas13d-based knockdown system CRISPRi-ART, we show that ChmA is essential for the E. coli phage Goslar life cycle. Without ChmA, infections are arrested at an early stage in which the injected phage genome is enclosed in a membrane-bound vesicle capable of gene expression but not DNA replication. Not only do we demonstrate that the phage nucleus is essential for genome replication, but we also show that the Chimalliviridae early phage infection (EPI) vesicle is a transcriptionally active, phage-generated organelle.\nA hematopoietic stem cell subset that retains memory of prior inflammatory stress accumulates in aging and clonal hematopoiesis\nAuthors: Zeng, A. G. X.; Nagree, M. S.; Jakobsen, N. A.; Shah, S.; Murison, A.; Cheong, J.-G.; Lim, I.; Jin, L.; Aguilar-Navarro, A. G.; Araujo, J.; Parris, D.; McLeod, J.; Kim, H.; Lee, H.; Zhang, L.; Boulanger, M.; Wagenblast, E.; Flores-Figueroa, E.; Wang, B.; Schwartz, G. W.; Josefowicz, S. Z.; Vyas, P.; Dick, J. E.; Xie, S. Z.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557271\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSC) must persist through a lifetime of infections to ensure life-long blood production, but whether molecular adaptations following inflammatory stress recovery in HSC are linked to aging and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) are unclear. Here, we performed single cell (sc) Multiomics on human HSC isolated from a xenograft inflammation-recovery model. Two transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct HSC subsets expressing canonical HSC programs were identified. Only one showed scATACseq and scRNAseq changes after recovery from TNF or lipopolysaccharide treatment. This inflammatory memory HSC (HSC-iM) program is enriched in memory T cells and HSC from recovered COVID-19 patients. Importantly, HSC-iM accumulates with age and with CH. Overall, a human HSC subset that retains memory of prior inflammatory stress has implications towards HSC fitness and leukemia transformation.\nA Novel Imaging Method (FIM-ID) Reveals that Myofibrillogenesis Plays a Major Role in the Mechanically Induced Growth of Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Jorgenson, K. W.; Hibbert, J. E.; Sayed, R. K.; Lange, A. N.; Godwin, J. S.; Mesquita, P. H.; Ruple, B. A.; McIntosh, M. C.; Kavazis, A. N.; Roberts, M. D.; Hornberger, T. A.\nScore: 42.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557204\nAn increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers (i.e., an increase in cross-sectional area). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e., myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e., myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (FIM-ID). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a foundationally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.\nThe anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation and expression of embryo-fetal globin genes in human erythroleukemia K562 cells\nAuthors: Zurlo, M.; Gasparello, J.; Verona, M.; Papi, C.; Cosenza, L. C.; Finotti, A.; Marzaro, G.; Gambari, R.\nScore: 984.1, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556634\nThe COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.\nMapping the substrate landscape of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit PPP2CA\nAuthors: Brewer, A.; Sathe, G.; Pflug, B. E.; Macartney, T.; Sapkota, G. P.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558429\nProtein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an essential Ser/Thr phosphatase that regulates a plethora of cellular processes. PP2A operates as a holoenzyme complex, comprising one each of the scaffolding (A), regulatory (B) and catalytic (C) subunits. PPP2CA is the principal catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme complex. Although previous studies have reported many substrates of specific PP2A holoenzyme complexes, the full scope of PP2A substrates in cells remains to be defined. To address this, we generated HEK293 cells in which PPP2CA was homozygously knocked in with a dTAG, allowing for efficient and selective degradation of dTAG-PPP2CA with proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) targeting the dTAG. By employing an unbiased global phospho-proteomic analysis, we identified 6,280 phospho-peptides corresponding to 2,204 proteins that showed a significant increase in abundance upon dTAG-PPP2CA degradation, implicating them as potential PPP2CA substrates. Among these, some were established PP2A substrates, while most were novel. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the involvement of the identified potential PPP2CA substrates in many cellular processes, including spliceosome function, the cell cycle, RNA transport and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We show that a pSP/pTP motif is a predominant target for PPP2CA. We confirmed some of our phospho-proteomic data with immunoblotting, by utilising commercially available phospho-specific antibodies. We provide an in-depth atlas of potential PPP2CA substrates and establish targeted degradation as a robust tool to unveil phosphatase substrates in cells.\nTargeting monocytic Occludin impairs monocyte transmigration and HIV neuroinvasion\nAuthors: Brychka, D.; Ayala-Nunez, N. V.; Bare, Y.; Dupas, A.; Partiot, E.; Mittelheisser, V.; Lucansky, V.; Goetz, J. G.; Osmani, N.; Gaudin, R.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557242\nTransmigration of circulating monocytes from the bloodstream toward the central nervous system (CNS) represents a hallmark of neuroinflammation and plays an important role during viral encephalitis and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The molecular mechanisms involved in monocyte transmigration through endothelia has been extensively studied, but how monocytes locally unzip tight junction-associated proteins (TJAPs) of the endothelium composing the neurovascular unit (NVU) to reach the CNS remains poorly understood. Here, we show that human circulating monocytes express the TJAP Occludin (OCLN) to promote transmigration through cerebral microvessel endothelial cells. Silencing monocytic OCLN (mOCLN) impairs monocyte transmigration, while mOCLN overexpression increases transmigration. Using high-resolution live cell imaging, we observed that mOCLN clusters at the monocyte-endothelium interface during the transmigration process, forming a transient ring of mOCLN at the site of diapedesis. Furthermore, we designed OCLN-derived peptides targeting its extracellular loop (EL) 1 or 2 to prevent potential trans-homotypic interactions of mOCLN with endothelial OCLN. We found that transmigration of human monocytes was significantly inhibited upon treatment with the EL2 peptide in vitro and in zebrafish embryos, while preserving vascular integrity. Monocyte transmigration toward the brain is an important process for HIV neuroinvasion and here, we showed that the treatment of transmigrating monocytes with the EL2 peptide prevents the dissemination of HIV to cerebral organoids. In conclusion, our study identifies an important role for monocytic OCLN during transmigration and provides a proof-of-concept for the development of mitigation strategies to prevent HIV neuroinvasion.\nThe sterol transporter STARD3 transports sphingosine at ER-lysosome contact sites\nAuthors: Hempelmann, P.; Lolicato, F.; Graziadei, A.; Brown, R. D. R.; Spiegel, S.; Rappsilber, J.; Nickel, W.; Höglinger, D.; Jamecna, D.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.557036\nSphingolipids are important structural components of membranes. Additionally, simple sphingolipids such as sphingosine are highly bioactive and participate in complex subcellular signaling. Sphingolipid deregulation is associated with many severe diseases including diabetes, Parkinsons and cancer. Here, we focus on how sphingosine, generated from sphingolipid catabolism in late endosomes/lysosomes, is reintegrated into the biosynthetic machinery at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We characterized the sterol transporter STARD3 as a sphingosine transporter acting at lysosome-ER contact sites. Experiments featuring crosslinkable sphingosine probes, supported by unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, exposed how sphingosine binds to the lipid-binding domain of STARD3. Following the metabolic fate of pre-localized lysosomal sphingosine showed the importance of STARD3 and its actions at contact sites for the integration of sphingosine into ceramide in a cellular context. Our findings provide the first example of inter-organellar sphingosine transfer and pave the way for a better understanding of sphingolipid - sterol co-regulation.\nSmall molecule correctors divert CFTR-F508del from ERAD by stabilizing sequential folding states\nAuthors: Riepe, C.; Wachalska, M.; Deol, K. K.; Amaya, A. K.; Porteus, M. H.; Olzmann, J.; Kopito, R. R.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.556420\nOver 80% of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells. F508del impairs CFTR folding causing it to be destroyed by endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Small molecule correctors, which act as pharmacological chaperones to divert CFTR-F508del from ERAD, are the primary strategy for treating CF, yet corrector development continues with only a rudimentary understanding of how ERAD targets CFTR-F508del. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to systematically identify the molecular machinery that underlies CFTR-F508del ERAD. Although the ER-resident ubiquitin ligase, RNF5 was the top E3 hit, knocking out RNF5 only modestly reduced CFTR-F508del degradation. Sublibrary screens in an RNF5 knockout background identified RNF185 as a redundant ligase, demonstrating that CFTR-F508del ERAD is highly buffered. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors tezacaftor (VX-661) and elexacaftor (VX-445) stabilize sequential, RNF5-resistant folding states. We propose that binding of correctors to nascent CFTR-F508del alters its folding landscape by stabilizing folding states that are not substrates for RNF5-mediated ubiquitylation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTO_LIClinically effective small molecule cystic fibrosis (CF) correctors divert mutant CFTR molecules from ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, the mechanisms underlying CFTR ERAD are not well-understood. C_LIO_LIThe authors used CRISPR knockout screens to identify ERAD machinery targeting CFTR-F508del and found that the pathway is highly buffered, with RNF185 serving as a redundant ubiquitin ligase for RNF5. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors act synergistically by stabilizing sequential RNF5-resistant folding states. C_LIO_LIInhibiting proteostasis machinery is a complementary approach for enhancing current CF corrector therapies.

Due to the semi-conservative nature of centrosome duplication, the two centrosomes differ in age. In asymmetric stem cell divisions, centrosome age can induce an asymmetry in half-spindle lengths. However, whether centrosome age affects the symmetry of the two half-spindles in tissue culture cells thought to divide symmetrically, is unknown. Here, we show that in human epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines centrosome age imposes a subtle spindle asymmetry that leads to asymmetric cell daughter sizes. At the mechanistic level, we show that this asymmetry depends on the preferential accumulation on old centrosomes of the microtubule nucleation-organizing proteins pericentrin, {gamma}-tubulin, Cdk5Rap2, and TPX2, under the control of a cenexin-bound pool of the mitotic kinase Plk1. Moreover, we find that old centrosomes have a higher microtubule nucleation capacity. We therefore postulate that centrosome age breaks spindle size symmetry via microtubule nucleation even in cells thought to divide symmetrically.\nMolecular and phenotypic blueprint of the hematopoietic compartment reveals proliferation stress as a driver of age-associated human stem cell dysfunctions\nAuthors: Lettera, E.; Scala, S.; Basso-Ricci, L.; Tavella, T.; della Volpe, L.; Lofurno, E.; Kauffmann, K.; Garcia-Prat, L.; Quaranta, P.; Hernandez, R.; Murison, A.; Giannetti, K.; Aguilar-Navarro, A.; Beretta, S.; Conti, A.; Farina, G.; Flores-Figueroa, E.; Conte, P.; Ometti, M.; Xie, S. Z.; Aiuti, A.; Di Micco, R.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557553\nHematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) aging studies have been associated with myeloid skewing, reduced clonal output, and impaired regenerative capacity, but quantitative immunophenotypic and functional analysis across human aging is lacking. Here, we provide a comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional dissection of human hematopoiesis across the lifespan. Although primitive HSPC numbers were stable during aging, overall cellularity was reduced, especially for erythroid and lymphoid lineages. Notably, HSPC from aged individuals had superior repopulating frequency than younger counterparts in xenografts; yet aged HSPC displayed epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle, inflammatory signatures, and a reduced capacity to counteract activation-induced proliferative stress with concomitant accumulation of DNA damage and senescence-like features upon xenotransplantation. This phenotype was recapitulated by enforcing proliferative stress in vivo on cord blood (CB) HSPC. Overall, our work sheds light on dysregulated responses to activation-induced proliferation underlying HSPC aging and establishes CB xenotransplantation-based models as suitable for studying age-associated hematopoietic defects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Eukaryotic viruses assemble compartments required for genome replication, but no such organelles are known to be essential for prokaryotic viruses. Bacteriophages of the family Chimalliviridae sequester their genomes within a phagegenerated organelle, the phage nucleus, which is enclosed by a lattice of viral protein ChmA. Using the dRfxCas13d-based knockdown system CRISPRi-ART, we show that ChmA is essential for the E. coli phage Goslar life cycle. Without ChmA, infections are arrested at an early stage in which the injected phage genome is enclosed in a membrane-bound vesicle capable of gene expression but not DNA replication. Not only do we demonstrate that the phage nucleus is essential for genome replication, but we also show that the Chimalliviridae early phage infection (EPI) vesicle is a transcriptionally active, phage-generated organelle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) must persist through a lifetime of infections to ensure life-long blood production, but whether molecular adaptations following inflammatory stress recovery in HSC are linked to aging and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) are unclear. Here, we performed single cell (sc) Multiomics on human HSC isolated from a xenograft inflammation-recovery model. Two transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct HSC subsets expressing canonical HSC programs were identified. Only one showed scATACseq and scRNAseq changes after recovery from TNF or lipopolysaccharide treatment. This inflammatory memory HSC (HSC-iM) program is enriched in memory T cells and HSC from recovered COVID-19 patients. Importantly, HSC-iM accumulates with age and with CH. Overall, a human HSC subset that retains memory of prior inflammatory stress has implications towards HSC fitness and leukemia transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers (i.e., an increase in cross-sectional area). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e., myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e., myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (FIM-ID). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a foundationally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an essential Ser/Thr phosphatase that regulates a plethora of cellular processes. PP2A operates as a holoenzyme complex, comprising one each of the scaffolding (A), regulatory (B) and catalytic (C) subunits. PPP2CA is the principal catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme complex. Although previous studies have reported many substrates of specific PP2A holoenzyme complexes, the full scope of PP2A substrates in cells remains to be defined. To address this, we generated HEK293 cells in which PPP2CA was homozygously knocked in with a dTAG, allowing for efficient and selective degradation of dTAG-PPP2CA with proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) targeting the dTAG. By employing an unbiased global phospho-proteomic analysis, we identified 6,280 phospho-peptides corresponding to 2,204 proteins that showed a significant increase in abundance upon dTAG-PPP2CA degradation, implicating them as potential PPP2CA substrates. Among these, some were established PP2A substrates, while most were novel. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the involvement of the identified potential PPP2CA substrates in many cellular processes, including spliceosome function, the cell cycle, RNA transport and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We show that a pSP/pTP motif is a predominant target for PPP2CA. We confirmed some of our phospho-proteomic data with immunoblotting, by utilising commercially available phospho-specific antibodies. We provide an in-depth atlas of potential PPP2CA substrates and establish targeted degradation as a robust tool to unveil phosphatase substrates in cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transmigration of circulating monocytes from the bloodstream toward the central nervous system (CNS) represents a hallmark of neuroinflammation and plays an important role during viral encephalitis and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The molecular mechanisms involved in monocyte transmigration through endothelia has been extensively studied, but how monocytes locally unzip tight junction-associated proteins (TJAPs) of the endothelium composing the neurovascular unit (NVU) to reach the CNS remains poorly understood. Here, we show that human circulating monocytes express the TJAP Occludin (OCLN) to promote transmigration through cerebral microvessel endothelial cells. Silencing monocytic OCLN (mOCLN) impairs monocyte transmigration, while mOCLN overexpression increases transmigration. Using high-resolution live cell imaging, we observed that mOCLN clusters at the monocyte-endothelium interface during the transmigration process, forming a transient ring of mOCLN at the site of diapedesis. Furthermore, we designed OCLN-derived peptides targeting its extracellular loop (EL) 1 or 2 to prevent potential trans-homotypic interactions of mOCLN with endothelial OCLN. We found that transmigration of human monocytes was significantly inhibited upon treatment with the EL2 peptide in vitro and in zebrafish embryos, while preserving vascular integrity. Monocyte transmigration toward the brain is an important process for HIV neuroinvasion and here, we showed that the treatment of transmigrating monocytes with the EL2 peptide prevents the dissemination of HIV to cerebral organoids. In conclusion, our study identifies an important role for monocytic OCLN during transmigration and provides a proof-of-concept for the development of mitigation strategies to prevent HIV neuroinvasion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sphingolipids are important structural components of membranes. Additionally, simple sphingolipids such as sphingosine are highly bioactive and participate in complex subcellular signaling. Sphingolipid deregulation is associated with many severe diseases including diabetes, Parkinsons and cancer. Here, we focus on how sphingosine, generated from sphingolipid catabolism in late endosomes/lysosomes, is reintegrated into the biosynthetic machinery at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We characterized the sterol transporter STARD3 as a sphingosine transporter acting at lysosome-ER contact sites. Experiments featuring crosslinkable sphingosine probes, supported by unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, exposed how sphingosine binds to the lipid-binding domain of STARD3. Following the metabolic fate of pre-localized lysosomal sphingosine showed the importance of STARD3 and its actions at contact sites for the integration of sphingosine into ceramide in a cellular context. Our findings provide the first example of inter-organellar sphingosine transfer and pave the way for a better understanding of sphingolipid - sterol co-regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over 80% of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells. F508del impairs CFTR folding causing it to be destroyed by endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Small molecule correctors, which act as pharmacological chaperones to divert CFTR-F508del from ERAD, are the primary strategy for treating CF, yet corrector development continues with only a rudimentary understanding of how ERAD targets CFTR-F508del. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to systematically identify the molecular machinery that underlies CFTR-F508del ERAD. Although the ER-resident ubiquitin ligase, RNF5 was the top E3 hit, knocking out RNF5 only modestly reduced CFTR-F508del degradation. Sublibrary screens in an RNF5 knockout background identified RNF185 as a redundant ligase, demonstrating that CFTR-F508del ERAD is highly buffered. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors tezacaftor (VX-661) and elexacaftor (VX-445) stabilize sequential, RNF5-resistant folding states. We propose that binding of correctors to nascent CFTR-F508del alters its folding landscape by stabilizing folding states that are not substrates for RNF5-mediated ubiquitylation.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTO_LIClinically effective small molecule cystic fibrosis (CF) correctors divert mutant CFTR molecules from ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, the mechanisms underlying CFTR ERAD are not well-understood.
C_LIO_LIThe authors used CRISPR knockout screens to identify ERAD machinery targeting CFTR-F508del and found that the pathway is highly buffered, with RNF185 serving as a redundant ubiquitin ligase for RNF5. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors act synergistically by stabilizing sequential RNF5-resistant folding states.
C_LIO_LIInhibiting proteostasis machinery is a complementary approach for enhancing current CF corrector therapies.

        <p class="abstract">Centrosomes are the main microtubule organizing center in animal cells. Due to the semi-conservative nature of centrosome duplication, the two centrosomes differ in age. In asymmetric stem cell divisions, centrosome age can induce an asymmetry in half-spindle lengths. However, whether centrosome age affects the symmetry of the two half-spindles in tissue culture cells thought to divide symmetrically, is unknown. Here, we show that in human epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines centrosome age imposes a subtle spindle asymmetry that leads to asymmetric cell daughter sizes. At the mechanistic level, we show that this asymmetry depends on the preferential accumulation on old centrosomes of the microtubule nucleation-organizing proteins pericentrin, {gamma}-tubulin, Cdk5Rap2, and TPX2, under the control of a cenexin-bound pool of the mitotic kinase Plk1. Moreover, we find that old centrosomes have a higher microtubule nucleation capacity. We therefore postulate that centrosome age breaks spindle size symmetry via microtubule nucleation even in cells thought to divide symmetrically.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) aging studies have been associated with myeloid skewing, reduced clonal output, and impaired regenerative capacity, but quantitative immunophenotypic and functional analysis across human aging is lacking. Here, we provide a comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional dissection of human hematopoiesis across the lifespan. Although primitive HSPC numbers were stable during aging, overall cellularity was reduced, especially for erythroid and lymphoid lineages. Notably, HSPC from aged individuals had superior repopulating frequency than younger counterparts in xenografts; yet aged HSPC displayed epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle, inflammatory signatures, and a reduced capacity to counteract activation-induced proliferative stress with concomitant accumulation of DNA damage and senescence-like features upon xenotransplantation. This phenotype was recapitulated by enforcing proliferative stress in vivo on cord blood (CB) HSPC. Overall, our work sheds light on dysregulated responses to activation-induced proliferation underlying HSPC aging and establishes CB xenotransplantation-based models as suitable for studying age-associated hematopoietic defects.</p>
