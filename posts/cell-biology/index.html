To address this gap, we developed scTF-seq, a technique inducing single-cell barcoded and doxycycline-inducible TF overexpression while quantifying TF dose-dependent transcriptomic changes. Applied to mouse embryonic multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), scTF-seq produced a gain-of-function atlas for 384 murine TFs. This atlas offers a valuable resource for gene regulation and reprogramming research, identifying key TFs governing MSC lineage differentiation, cell cycle control, and their interplay. Leveraging the single-cell resolution, we dissected reprogramming heterogeneity along dose and pseudotime. We thereby revealed TF dose-dependent and stochastic cell fate branching, unveiling gene expression signatures that enhance our understanding and prediction of reprogramming efficiency. scTF-seq also allowed us to classify TFs into four sensitivity classes based on dose response and determining features. Finally, in combinatorial scTF-seq, we observed that the same TF can exhibit both synergistic and antagonistic effects on another TF depending on its dose. In summary, scTF-seq provides a powerful tool for gaining mechanistic insights into how TFs determine cell states, while offering novel perspectives for cellular engineering strategies.\nBRD4-mediated epigenetic regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites is governed by the mitochondrial complex III\nAuthors: Chen, B.; Lynn-Nguyen, T. M.; Jadhav, P.; Halligan, B. S.; Rossiter, N. J.; Guerra, R. M.; Koshkin, S.; Koo, I.; Morlacchi, P.; Hanna, D. A.; Lin, J.; Banerjee, R.; Pagliarini, D.; Patterson, A. D.; Mosalaganti, S.; Sexton, J.; Cali, T.; Lyssiotis, C. A.; Shah, Y. M.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578646\nInter-organellar communication is critical for cellular metabolic homeostasis. One of the most abundant inter-organellar interactions are those at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing ERMCS regulation and their roles in cellular metabolism are limited by a lack of tools that permit temporal induction and reversal. Through unbiased screening approaches, we identified fedratinib, an FDA-approved drug, that dramatically increases ERMCS abundance by inhibiting the epigenetic modifier BRD4. Fedratinib rapidly and reversibly modulates mitochondrial and ER morphology and alters metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, ERMCS modulation depends on mitochondria electron transport chain complex III function. Comparison of fedratinib activity to other reported inducers of ERMCS revealed common mechanisms of induction and function, providing clarity and union to a growing body of experimental observations. In total, our results uncovered a novel epigenetic signaling pathway and an endogenous metabolic regulator that connects ERMCS and cellular metabolism.\nNuclear pores safeguard the integrity of the nuclear envelope\nAuthors: Taniguchi, R.; Orniacki, C.; Kreysing, J. P.; Zila, V.; Zimmerli, C. E.; Boehm, S.; Turonova, B.; Kraeusslich, H.-G.; Doye, V.; Beck, M.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578890\nNuclear pore complexes (NPCs) constitute giant channels within the nuclear envelope that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. NPC diameter is thought to be regulated by nuclear envelope tension, but how such diameter changes are physiologically linked to cell differentiation, where mechanical properties of nuclei are remodeled and nuclear mechanosensing occurs, remains unstudied. Here we used cryo-electron tomography to show that NPCs dilate during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors. In Nup133-deficient cells, which are known to display impaired neural differentiation, NPCs however fail to dilate. By analyzing the architectures of individual NPCs with template matching, we revealed that the Nup133-deficient NPCs are structurally heterogeneous and frequently disintegrate, resulting in the formation of large nuclear envelope openings. We propose that the elasticity of the NPC scaffold mechanically safeguards the nuclear envelope. Our studies provide a molecular explanation for how genetic perturbation of scaffolding components of macromolecular complexes causes tissue-specific phenotypes.\nPlasmodium NEK1 coordinates MTOC organisation and kinetochore attachment during rapid mitosis in male gamete formation\nAuthors: Zeeshan, M.; Rashpa, R.; Ferguson, D.

Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within eight minutes followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes. Our previous Plasmodium kinome screen identified four Nek genes, of which two, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that Plasmodium NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.\nA β-catenin:MSI2 axis regulates the expression of LEF1 and subsequent human haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation\nAuthors: Morgan, R. G.; Wagstaff, M.; Nguyen, D. T.; Blair, A.; Towler, B. P.; Newbury, S. F.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577638\nWnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is important for normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) biology and heavily implicated in many hematological malignancies. The central mediator, {beta}-catenin, is an attractive therapeutic target in myeloid neoplasms however, the design of targeted agents has been hampered by a limited understanding of its molecular interactions in hematopoietic cells. To address this shortfall, we recently published the first {beta}-catenin interactome (Morgan et al, 2019) in haematological cells and identified a plethora of novel partners which included the significant enrichment of RNA binding proteins (Wagstaff et al, 2022), including Musashi-2 (MSI2). MSI2 has been extensively implicated in normal HSC activity and also promotes aggressive myeloid leukemias where its expression confers inferior survival. Interaction between MSI2 and Wnt signalling has not previously been reported in a hematopoietic context. In this study we identify an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in both myeloid cell lines and primary AML patient samples where there is a significant degree of correlation between the proteins. We demonstrate that MSI2 can impact Wnt signalling output (TCF/LEF activity) through modulating LEF-1 expression and localization, and that MSI2 can further bind LEF1 transcript, an interaction augmented by {beta}-catenin. Finally, we show that MSI2 mediated expansion of HSPCs could be partly driven through LEF1 regulation. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in haematopoietic cells, and shows the potential for {beta}-catenin to cooperate with RBPs to govern HSPC proliferation. Finally, these data indicate {beta}-catenin may also serve critical post-transcriptional functions (in addition to transcriptional roles) in haematopoietic cells, which could extend to regulating expression of Wnt signalling components.\nPlasmodium RON11 triggers biogenesis of the merozoite rhoptry pair and is essential for erythrocyte invasion\nAuthors: Anaguano, D.; Adewale Fasoro, O.; Vick, G. S.; Blauwkamp, J. A.; Yanik, S.; Fierro, M. A.; Absalon, S.; SRINIVASAN, P.; Muralidharan, V.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577654\nMalaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs, begins with the invasion of RBCs by P. falciparum, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from two specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains seven transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the P. falciparum RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11 deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11 deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11 deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.\nShaping up genomes: Prokaryotic roots and eukaryotic diversification of SMC complexes\nAuthors: van Hooff, J. J. E.; Raas, M. W. D.; Tromer, E. C.; Eme, L.\nScore: 29.9, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.573240\nAcross the tree of life, SMC complexes organize, segregate and regulate DNA. In contrast to prokaryotes, which often possess one SMC complex, eukaryotes usually have four such complexes. This expanded set is involved in managing the considerably larger nuclear genomes of eukaryotes, which are distributed across multiple chromosomes. Despite their essential functions, SMC complexes exhibit variations across model eukaryotes, suggesting an even greater variety of these complexes that remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to uncover the diversity and evolution of SMC complexes across eukaryotes, and their deeper, prokaryotic evolutionary origins. For this, we conducted in-depth comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SMC complexes. We show that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) likely had fully-fledged versions of all four complexes and that the condensin II complex was later lost at least 30 times in eukaryotes. We report evidence that proteins previously designated as functional analogs in various model organisms (e.g., Sororin, Securin, Nse5 and Nse6) are in fact genuine orthologs. Finally, we traced the prokaryotic origins of these complexes and propose that a single SMC complex duplicated in an early archaeon. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of eukaryotic SMC complex diversity and evolution, both addressing and generating questions about their functioning in ancestral and contemporary organisms.\nCryosectioning-enabled super-resolution microscopy for studying nuclear architecture at the single protein level\nAuthors: Stein, J.; Ericsson, M.; Nofal, M.; Magni, L.; Aufmkolk, S.; McMillan, R.

However, most cellular targets elude the accessible TIRF range close to the cover glass and thus require alternative imaging conditions, affecting resolution and image quality. Here, we address this limitation by applying ultrathin physical cryosectioning in combination with DNA-PAINT. With \"tomographic \u0026 kinetically-enhanced\" DNA-PAINT (tokPAINT), we demonstrate the imaging of nuclear proteins with sub-3 nanometer localization precision, advancing the quantitative study of nuclear organization within fixed cells and mouse tissues at the level of single antibodies. We believe that ultrathin sectioning combined with the versatility and multiplexing capabilities of DNA-PAINT will be a powerful addition to the toolbox of quantitative DNA-based super-resolution microscopy in intracellular structural analyses of proteins, RNA and DNA in situ.\nCa2+-sensor ALG-2 engages ESCRTs to enhance lysosomal membrane resilience to osmotic stress\nAuthors: Chen, W.; Motsinger, M. M.; Li, J.; Bohannon, K. P.; Hanson, P. I.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578682\nLysosomes are central players in cellular catabolism, signaling, and metabolic regulation. Cellular and environmental stresses that damage lysosomal membranes can compromise their function and release toxic content into the cytoplasm. Here, we examine how cells respond to osmotic stress within lysosomes. Using sensitive assays of lysosomal leakage and rupture, we examine acute effects of the cathepsin C-metabolized osmotic disruptant glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN). Our findings reveal that widely used concentrations of GPN rupture only a small fraction of lysosomes, but surprisingly trigger Ca2+ release from nearly all. Chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+ using BAPTA makes lysosomes more likely to rupture under GPN-induced stress, suggesting that Ca2+ plays a role in protecting or rapidly repairing lysosomal membranes. Mechanistically, we establish that GPN causes the Ca2+-sensitive protein Apoptosis Linked Gene-2 (ALG-2) and interacting ESCRT proteins to redistribute onto lysosomes, improving their resistance to membrane stress created by GPN as well as the lysosomotropic drug chlorpromazine. Furthermore, we show that activating the cation channel TRPML1, with or without blocking the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, creates local Ca2+ signals that protect lysosomes from rupture by recruiting ALG-2 and ESCRTs without any membrane damage. These findings reveal that Ca2+, through ALG-2, helps bring ESCRTs to lysosomes to enhance their resilience and maintain organelle integrity in the face of osmotic stress.\nA Novel Therapeutic Approach using CXCR3 Blockade to Treat Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-mediated Myocarditis\nAuthors: Huang, Y. V.; Lee, D.; Sun, Y.; Chou, H.; Xu, B.; Lin, Z.; Branche, C.; Bayer, A. L.; Waliany, S.; Neal, J.; Wakelee, H.; Witteles, R.; Nguyen, P.; Graves, E. E.; Alcaide, P.; Berry, G. J.; Wu, S. M.; Zhu, H.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.576279\nBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are successful in treating many cancers but may cause immune-related adverse events. ICI-mediated myocarditis has a high fatality rate of up to 40%, with severe cardiovascular consequences. Targeted therapies for ICI myocarditis are currently lacking. MethodsWe used a genetic mouse model of PD-1 deletion (MRL/Pdcd1-/-) along with a novel drug-treated ICI myocarditis mouse model to recapitulate the disease phenotype. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) on immune cells isolated from MRL and MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice at serial timepoints. We assessed the impact of macrophage deletion in MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice, then inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in ICI-treated mice to assess therapeutic effect on myocarditis phenotype. Furthermore, we delineated functional effects of CXCR3 blockade on T-cell and macrophage interactions in a transwell assay. We then correlated the results in human single-cell multi-omics data from blood and heart biopsy data from patients with ICI myocarditis. ResultsSingle-cell multi-omics demonstrated expansion of CXCL9/10+CCR2+ macrophages and CXCR3hi CD8+ effector T-lymphocytes in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice correlating with onset of myocarditis development. Both depletion of CXCL9/10+CCR2+ macrophages and CXCR3 blockade respectively led to decreased CXCR3hiCD8+ T-cell infiltration into the heart and significantly improved survival. A transwell assay showed that selective blockade of CXCR3 and its ligand, CXCL10 decreased CD8+ T-cell migration towards macrophages, implicating this interaction in T-cell cardiotropism towards cardiac macrophages. Cardiac biopsies from patients with confirmed ICI myocarditis demonstrated infiltrating CXCR3+ lymphocytes and CXCL9+/CXCL10+ macrophages. Both mouse cardiac immune cells and patient peripheral blood immune cells revealed expanded TCRs correlating with CXCR3hi CD8+ T-cells in ICI myocarditis samples. ConclusionsThese findings bring forth the CXCR3-CXCL9/10 axis as an attractive therapeutic target for ICI myocarditis treatment, and more broadly, as a druggable pathway in cardiac inflammation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Reprogramming approaches often produce heterogeneous cell fates and the mechanisms behind this heterogeneity are not well-understood. To address this gap, we developed scTF-seq, a technique inducing single-cell barcoded and doxycycline-inducible TF overexpression while quantifying TF dose-dependent transcriptomic changes. Applied to mouse embryonic multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), scTF-seq produced a gain-of-function atlas for 384 murine TFs. This atlas offers a valuable resource for gene regulation and reprogramming research, identifying key TFs governing MSC lineage differentiation, cell cycle control, and their interplay. Leveraging the single-cell resolution, we dissected reprogramming heterogeneity along dose and pseudotime. We thereby revealed TF dose-dependent and stochastic cell fate branching, unveiling gene expression signatures that enhance our understanding and prediction of reprogramming efficiency. scTF-seq also allowed us to classify TFs into four sensitivity classes based on dose response and determining features. Finally, in combinatorial scTF-seq, we observed that the same TF can exhibit both synergistic and antagonistic effects on another TF depending on its dose. In summary, scTF-seq provides a powerful tool for gaining mechanistic insights into how TFs determine cell states, while offering novel perspectives for cellular engineering strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-organellar communication is critical for cellular metabolic homeostasis. One of the most abundant inter-organellar interactions are those at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing ERMCS regulation and their roles in cellular metabolism are limited by a lack of tools that permit temporal induction and reversal. Through unbiased screening approaches, we identified fedratinib, an FDA-approved drug, that dramatically increases ERMCS abundance by inhibiting the epigenetic modifier BRD4. Fedratinib rapidly and reversibly modulates mitochondrial and ER morphology and alters metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, ERMCS modulation depends on mitochondria electron transport chain complex III function. Comparison of fedratinib activity to other reported inducers of ERMCS revealed common mechanisms of induction and function, providing clarity and union to a growing body of experimental observations. In total, our results uncovered a novel epigenetic signaling pathway and an endogenous metabolic regulator that connects ERMCS and cellular metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) constitute giant channels within the nuclear envelope that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. NPC diameter is thought to be regulated by nuclear envelope tension, but how such diameter changes are physiologically linked to cell differentiation, where mechanical properties of nuclei are remodeled and nuclear mechanosensing occurs, remains unstudied. Here we used cryo-electron tomography to show that NPCs dilate during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors. In Nup133-deficient cells, which are known to display impaired neural differentiation, NPCs however fail to dilate. By analyzing the architectures of individual NPCs with template matching, we revealed that the Nup133-deficient NPCs are structurally heterogeneous and frequently disintegrate, resulting in the formation of large nuclear envelope openings. We propose that the elasticity of the NPC scaffold mechanically safeguards the nuclear envelope. Our studies provide a molecular explanation for how genetic perturbation of scaffolding components of macromolecular complexes causes tissue-specific phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitosis is an important process in the cell cycle required for cells to divide. Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within eight minutes followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes. Our previous Plasmodium kinome screen identified four Nek genes, of which two, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that Plasmodium NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is important for normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) biology and heavily implicated in many hematological malignancies. The central mediator, {beta}-catenin, is an attractive therapeutic target in myeloid neoplasms however, the design of targeted agents has been hampered by a limited understanding of its molecular interactions in hematopoietic cells. To address this shortfall, we recently published the first {beta}-catenin interactome (Morgan et al, 2019) in haematological cells and identified a plethora of novel partners which included the significant enrichment of RNA binding proteins (Wagstaff et al, 2022), including Musashi-2 (MSI2). MSI2 has been extensively implicated in normal HSC activity and also promotes aggressive myeloid leukemias where its expression confers inferior survival. Interaction between MSI2 and Wnt signalling has not previously been reported in a hematopoietic context. In this study we identify an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in both myeloid cell lines and primary AML patient samples where there is a significant degree of correlation between the proteins. We demonstrate that MSI2 can impact Wnt signalling output (TCF/LEF activity) through modulating LEF-1 expression and localization, and that MSI2 can further bind LEF1 transcript, an interaction augmented by {beta}-catenin. Finally, we show that MSI2 mediated expansion of HSPCs could be partly driven through LEF1 regulation. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in haematopoietic cells, and shows the potential for {beta}-catenin to cooperate with RBPs to govern HSPC proliferation. Finally, these data indicate {beta}-catenin may also serve critical post-transcriptional functions (in addition to transcriptional roles) in haematopoietic cells, which could extend to regulating expression of Wnt signalling components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs, begins with the invasion of RBCs by P. falciparum, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from two specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains seven transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the P. falciparum RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11 deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11 deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11 deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Across the tree of life, SMC complexes organize, segregate and regulate DNA. In contrast to prokaryotes, which often possess one SMC complex, eukaryotes usually have four such complexes. This expanded set is involved in managing the considerably larger nuclear genomes of eukaryotes, which are distributed across multiple chromosomes. Despite their essential functions, SMC complexes exhibit variations across model eukaryotes, suggesting an even greater variety of these complexes that remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to uncover the diversity and evolution of SMC complexes across eukaryotes, and their deeper, prokaryotic evolutionary origins. For this, we conducted in-depth comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SMC complexes. We show that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) likely had fully-fledged versions of all four complexes and that the condensin II complex was later lost at least 30 times in eukaryotes. We report evidence that proteins previously designated as functional analogs in various model organisms (e.g., Sororin, Securin, Nse5 and Nse6) are in fact genuine orthologs. Finally, we traced the prokaryotic origins of these complexes and propose that a single SMC complex duplicated in an early archaeon. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of eukaryotic SMC complex diversity and evolution, both addressing and generating questions about their functioning in ancestral and contemporary organisms.</p>

However, most cellular targets elude the accessible TIRF range close to the cover glass and thus require alternative imaging conditions, affecting resolution and image quality. Here, we address this limitation by applying ultrathin physical cryosectioning in combination with DNA-PAINT. With &#34;tomographic &amp; kinetically-enhanced&#34; DNA-PAINT (tokPAINT), we demonstrate the imaging of nuclear proteins with sub-3 nanometer localization precision, advancing the quantitative study of nuclear organization within fixed cells and mouse tissues at the level of single antibodies. We believe that ultrathin sectioning combined with the versatility and multiplexing capabilities of DNA-PAINT will be a powerful addition to the toolbox of quantitative DNA-based super-resolution microscopy in intracellular structural analyses of proteins, RNA and DNA in situ.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lysosomes are central players in cellular catabolism, signaling, and metabolic regulation. Cellular and environmental stresses that damage lysosomal membranes can compromise their function and release toxic content into the cytoplasm. Here, we examine how cells respond to osmotic stress within lysosomes. Using sensitive assays of lysosomal leakage and rupture, we examine acute effects of the cathepsin C-metabolized osmotic disruptant glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN). Our findings reveal that widely used concentrations of GPN rupture only a small fraction of lysosomes, but surprisingly trigger Ca2&#43; release from nearly all. Chelating cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; using BAPTA makes lysosomes more likely to rupture under GPN-induced stress, suggesting that Ca2&#43; plays a role in protecting or rapidly repairing lysosomal membranes. Mechanistically, we establish that GPN causes the Ca2&#43;-sensitive protein Apoptosis Linked Gene-2 (ALG-2) and interacting ESCRT proteins to redistribute onto lysosomes, improving their resistance to membrane stress created by GPN as well as the lysosomotropic drug chlorpromazine. Furthermore, we show that activating the cation channel TRPML1, with or without blocking the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2&#43; pump, creates local Ca2&#43; signals that protect lysosomes from rupture by recruiting ALG-2 and ESCRTs without any membrane damage. These findings reveal that Ca2&#43;, through ALG-2, helps bring ESCRTs to lysosomes to enhance their resilience and maintain organelle integrity in the face of osmotic stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are successful in treating many cancers but may cause immune-related adverse events. ICI-mediated myocarditis has a high fatality rate of up to 40%, with severe cardiovascular consequences. Targeted therapies for ICI myocarditis are currently lacking.

MethodsWe used a genetic mouse model of PD-1 deletion (MRL/Pdcd1-/-) along with a novel drug-treated ICI myocarditis mouse model to recapitulate the disease phenotype. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) on immune cells isolated from MRL and MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice at serial timepoints. We assessed the impact of macrophage deletion in MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice, then inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in ICI-treated mice to assess therapeutic effect on myocarditis phenotype. Furthermore, we delineated functional effects of CXCR3 blockade on T-cell and macrophage interactions in a transwell assay. We then correlated the results in human single-cell multi-omics data from blood and heart biopsy data from patients with ICI myocarditis.

ResultsSingle-cell multi-omics demonstrated expansion of CXCL9/10&#43;CCR2&#43; macrophages and CXCR3hi CD8&#43; effector T-lymphocytes in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice correlating with onset of myocarditis development. Both depletion of CXCL9/10&#43;CCR2&#43; macrophages and CXCR3 blockade respectively led to decreased CXCR3hiCD8&#43; T-cell infiltration into the heart and significantly improved survival. A transwell assay showed that selective blockade of CXCR3 and its ligand, CXCL10 decreased CD8&#43; T-cell migration towards macrophages, implicating this interaction in T-cell cardiotropism towards cardiac macrophages. Cardiac biopsies from patients with confirmed ICI myocarditis demonstrated infiltrating CXCR3&#43; lymphocytes and CXCL9&#43;/CXCL10&#43; macrophages. Both mouse cardiac immune cells and patient peripheral blood immune cells revealed expanded TCRs correlating with CXCR3hi CD8&#43; T-cells in ICI myocarditis samples.

ConclusionsThese findings bring forth the CXCR3-CXCL9/10 axis as an attractive therapeutic target for ICI myocarditis treatment, and more broadly, as a druggable pathway in cardiac inflammation.</p>
