A. M.; Ford, M.; Sosnick, T. R.; Drummond, D. A.\nScore: 39.4, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551061\nCells must sense and respond to sudden maladaptive environmental changes--stresses--to survive and thrive. Across eukaryotes, stresses such as heat shock trigger conserved responses: growth arrest, a specific transcriptional response, and biomolecular condensation of protein and mRNA into structures known as stress granules under severe stress. The composition, formation mechanism, adaptive significance, and even evolutionary conservation of these condensed structures remain enigmatic. Here we provide an unprecedented view into stress-triggered condensation, its evolutionary conservation and tuning, and its integration into other well-studied aspects of the stress response. Using three morphologically near-identical budding yeast species adapted to different thermal environments and diverged by up to 100 million years, we show that proteome-scale biomolecular condensation is tuned to species-specific thermal niches, closely tracking corresponding growth and transcriptional responses. In each species, poly(A)-binding protein--a core marker of stress granules--condenses in isolation at species-specific temperatures, with conserved molecular features and conformational changes modulating condensation. From the ecological to the molecular scale, our results reveal previously unappreciated levels of evolutionary selection in the eukaryotic stress response, while establishing a rich, tractable system for further inquiry.\nApical annuli are specialised sites of post-invasion secretion of dense granules in Toxoplasma\nAuthors: Chelaghma, S.; Ke, H.; Barylyuk, K.; Krueger, T.; Koreny, L.; Waller, R. F.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550681\nApicomplexans are ubiquitous intracellular parasites of animals. These parasites use a programmed sequence of secretory events to find, invade, and then reengineer their host cells to enable parasite growth and proliferation. The secretory organelles micronemes and rhoptries mediate the first steps of invasion. Both secrete their contents through the apical complex which provides an apical opening in the parasites elaborate inner membrane complex (IMC) -- an extensive subpellicular system of flattened membrane cisternae and proteinaceous meshwork that otherwise limits access of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for material exchange with the cell exterior. After invasion, a second secretion programme drives host cell remodelling and occurs from dense granules. The site(s) of dense granule exocytosis, however, has been unknown. In Toxoplasma gondii, small subapical annular structures that are embedded in the IMC have been observed, but the role or significance of these apical annuli to plasma membrane function has also been unknown. Here, we determined that integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane occur specifically at these apical annular sites, that these proteins include SNARE proteins, and that the apical annuli are sites of vesicle fusion and exocytosis. Specifically, we show that dense granules require these structures for the secretion of their cargo proteins. When secretion is perturbed at the apical annuli, parasite growth is arrested. The apical annuli, therefore, represent a second structure in the IMC specialised for protein secretion, and reveal that in Toxoplasma there is a physical separation of the processes of pre- and post-invasion secretion that mediate host-parasite interactions.\npHusion: A robust and versatile toolset for automated detection and analysis of exocytosis\nAuthors: O'Shaughnessy, E. C.; Lam, M.; Ryken, S. E.; Wiesner, T.; Lukasik, K.; Zuchero, J. B.; Leterrier, C.; Adalsteinsson, D.; Gupton, S. L.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550499\nExocytosis is a fundamental process used by all eukaryotic cells to regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and facilitate cell-cell communication. To investigate the role exocytosis plays in neuronal morphogenesis, previously we developed computational tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the automatic detection and analysis of exocytic events (ADAE GUI) from fluorescence timelapse images. Though these tools have proven useful, we found that the code was brittle and not easily adapted to different experimental conditions. Here, we developed and validated a robust and versatile toolkit, we have named pHusion, for the analysis of exocytosis written in Image-Tank, a graphical programming language that combines image visualization and numerical methods. We tested this method using a variety of imaging modalities and pH-sensitive fluorophores, diverse cell types, and various exocytic markers to generate a flexible and intuitive package. Using pHusion, we show that VAMP3-mediated exocytosis occurs 30-times more frequently in melanoma cells compared with primary oligodendrocytes, that VAMP2-mediated fusion events in mature rat hippocampal neurons are much longer lasting than those in immature murine cortical neurons, and that clustering of exocytic events occurs across cell types.\nThe membrane-actin linkers ezrin, radixin, and moesin are dispensable for macrophage migration and cortex mechanics.\nAuthors: Verdys, P.; Rey Barroso, J.; Vermeil, J.; Bergert, M.; Sanchez, T.; Metais, A.; Mangeat, T.; Bellard, E.; Bigot, C.; Girard, J.-P.; Maridonneau-Parini, I.; Verollet, C.; Lagarrigue, F.; Diz-Munoz, A.; Heuvingh, J.; Piel, M.; Du Roure, O.; Le Cabec, V.; Carreno, S.; Poincloux, R.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550674\nThe cellular actin cortex provides crucial mechanical support and plays critical roles in numerous functions, including cell division and migration. The proteins of the ERM family, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are central to these processes by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the individual contributions of these three proteins to leukocyte migration, we generated single and triple ERM knock-out macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that even in the absence of ERMs, macrophages can still form the different actin structures promoting cell migration, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and ruffles. Furthermore we discovered that, unlike every other cell type previously investigated, the single or triple knock-out of ERMs does not affect macrophage migration in a large diversity of contexts. Finally, we demonstrated that the loss of ERMs in macrophages does not affect the mechanics of their actin cortex. These findings challenge the notion that ERMs are universally essential for cortex mechanics and cell migration and support the notion that the macrophage cortex may have diverged from that of other cells to allow for their adaptive cortical plasticity.\nIF1 controls UCP1-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics in brown adipocytes\nAuthors: Brunetta, H. S.; Jung, A. S.; Francisco, A.; Castilho, R. F.; Mori, M. A.; Bartelt, A.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550888\nIn thermogenic adipocytes, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is a key mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) by uncoupling the electron transport chain from FoF1-ATP synthase-mediated ATP production. While regulatory mechanisms of UCP1 are important for NST, it is unknown whether also the activity of ATP synthase is modulated during NST. Here, we show a critical role of Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, for brown adipocyte energy metabolism. In mice, IF1 protein content is diminished in brown adipose tissue of mice after 5 days of cold exposure. Additionally, the capacity of ATP synthase to generate mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through ATP hydrolysis (the so-called reverse mode) was higher in mitochondria isolated from cold-adapted mice compared to mice housed at room temperature. While silencing of IF1 in cultured brown adipocytes did not affect MMP, IF1 overexpression resulted in an inability of mitochondria to sustain MMP upon adrenergic stimulation. The effects of IF1 overexpression on MMP were blunted when UCP1 was silenced or when a mutant IF1, incapable of binding to ATP synthase, was used. In brown adipocytes, IF1 ablation was sufficient to increase mitochondrial lipid oxidation and the cellular dependency on glycolysis to produce ATP. Conversely, IF1 overexpression blunted mitochondrial respiration without causing energetic stress, leading to a quiescent-like phenotype in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that the cold-induced downregulation of IF1 facilitates the reverse mode of ATP synthase and enables proper bioenergetic adaptation of brown adipose tissue to effectively support NST.

J. A.; Goo, C. E. A.; Rasmussen, J. P.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550974\nSkin is often the first physical barrier to encounter invading pathogens and physical damage. Damage to the skin must be resolved quickly and efficiently to maintain organ homeostasis. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to dynamically surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains epithelial keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are not well understood. Using skin explants from adult zebrafish, we show that Langerhans cells maintain normal surveillance activity following axonal degeneration and use their dynamic dendrites to engulf small axonal debris. By contrast, a ramified-to-rounded shape transition accommodates the engulfment of larger keratinocyte debris. We find that Langerhans cell dendrites are richly populated with actin and sensitive to a broad spectrum actin inhibitor. We further show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition leads to elongated dendrites, perturbed clearance of large debris, and reduced Langerhans cell migration to tissue-scale wounds. Altogether, our work describes the unique dynamics of Langerhans cells and involvement of the ROCK pathway in immune cell responses to damage of varying magnitude.\nNanoscale analysis of human G1 and metaphase chromatin in situ\nAuthors: Chen, J. K.; Liu, T.; Cai, S.; Ruan, W.; Ng, C. T.; Shi, J.; Surana, U.; Gan, L.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551204\nThe structure of chromatin at the nucleosome level inside cells is mysterious. Here we present in situ cryo-ET analyses of chromatin in both G1 and metaphase RPE-1 cells. G1 nucleosomes are concentrated in globular chromatin domains and metaphase nucleosomes are concentrated in the chromatids. Classification analysis reveals that canonical mononucleosomes, ordered stacked dinucleosomes, and mononucleosomes with a disordered gyre-proximal density are abundant in both cell-cycle states. Class averages that have more than two stacked nucleosomes or that have side-by-side dinucleosomes are not detected, suggesting that groups of more than two nucleosomes are heterogeneous. Large multi-megadalton structures are abundant in G1 nucleoplasm, but not found in G1 chromatin domains and metaphase chromatin. The macromolecular phenotypes studied here represent a starting point for the comparative analysis of condensation in normal and unhealthy human cells, in other cell-cycle states, other organisms, and in vitro chromatin assemblies.\nTargeted Photoconvertible BODIPYs Based on Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion for Applications in Photoconversion and Live Super Resolution Imaging\nAuthors: Saladin, L.; Breton, V.; Lequeu, T.; Didier, P.; Danglot, L.; Collot, M.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550940\nPhotomodulable fluorescent probes are drawing an increasing attention due to their applications in advanced bioimaging. Whereas photoconvertible probes can be advantageously used in tracking, photoswitchable probes constitute key tools for single molecule localization microscopy to perform super resolution imaging. Herein we shed light on a red and far-red BODIPY, namely BDP-576 and BDP-650 possessing both properties of conversion and switching. Our study demonstrates that theses pyrrolyl-BODIPYs respectively convert towards typical green- and red-emitting BODIPYs that are perfectly adapted to microscopy. We also showed that these pyrrolyl-BODIPYs undergo Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion, a photoconversion mechanism that we recently introduced and where the pyrrole moiety plays a central role. These unique features were used to develop targeted photoconvertible probes towards different organelles or subcellular units (plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, actin, Golgi apparatus, etc.) using chemical targeting moieties and Halo tag. We notably showed that BDP-650 could be used to track intracellular vesicles over more than 20 minutes in two color imaging with laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating its robustness. The switching properties of these photoconverters were studied at the single molecule level and were then successfully used in live Single Molecule Localization Microscopy in epithelial cells and neurons. Both membrane and mitochondria targeted probes could be used to decipher membrane 3D architecture and mitochondria dynamics at the nanoscale. This study builds a bridge between the photoconversion and photoswitching properties of probes undergoing directed photooxidation and shows the versatility and efficacy of this mechanism in live advanced imaging.\nLeishmania major-induced alteration of host cellular and systemic copper homeostasis drives the fate of infection\nAuthors: Paul, R.; Chakrabarty, A.; Dey, S.; Samanta, S.; Pandey, R.; Maji, S.; Pezacki, A. T.; Chang, C. J.; Datta, R.; Gupta, A.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550461\nCopper plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction. We found that during Leishmania major infection, the parasite-harboring macrophage regulates its copper homeostasis pathway in a way to facilitate copper-mediated neutralization of the pathogen. Copper-ATPase ATP7A transports copper to amastigote-harboring phagolysosomes to induce stress on parasites. Leishmania in order to evade the copper stress, utilizes a variety of manipulative measures to lower the host-induced copper stress. It induces deglycosylation and degradation of host-ATP7A and downregulation of copper importer, CTR1 by cysteine oxidation. Additionally, Leishmania induces CTR1 endocytosis that arrests copper uptake. In mouse model of infection, we report an increase in systemic bioavailable copper in infected animals. Heart acts as the major organ for diverting its copper reserves to systemic circulation to fight-off infection by downregulating its CTR1. Our study explores reciprocal mechanism of manipulation of host copper homeostasis pathway by macrophage and Leishmania to gain respective advantages in host-pathogen interaction.\nActin-Driven Nanotopography Enhances Integrin Molecular Clutch in Developing Tissue\nAuthors: Chen, T.; Huertas Fernandez-Espartero, C.; Illand, A.; Tsai, C.-T.; Yang, Y.; Klapholz, B.; Jouchet, P.; Fabre, M.; Rossier, O.; Cui, B.; Leveque-Fort, S.; Brown, N. H.; Giannone, G.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550203\nMorphogenesis requires building stable macromolecular structures from highly dynamic proteins. Muscles are anchored by long-lasting integrin adhesions to resist contractile force. However, the mechanisms governing integrin diffusion, immobilization, and activation within developing tissue remain elusive. Here, we show that actin polymerisation-driven membrane protrusions form nanotopographies resulting in strong adhesions in the Drosophila muscle attachment site. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that integrins assemble adhesive belts around Arp2/3-dependent actin protrusions, forming an invadosomes-like structure with membrane nanotopographies. Single protein tracking showed that, during MAS development, integrins exhibit enhanced molecular immobilization and confinement in diffusion traps formed by these membrane nanotopographies. Actin filaments also display restricted motion and confinement, indicating strong mechanical connection with integrins. Using isolated muscle cells, we show that substrate nanotopography, instead of rigidity, drives adhesion maturation by regulating actin protrusion, integrin diffusion and immobilization. These results point to the existence of a molecular clutch in developing tissue required for the formation of stable adhesions and highlight the importance of geometrical information in cellular and tissue morphogenesis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cells must sense and respond to sudden maladaptive environmental changes--stresses--to survive and thrive. Across eukaryotes, stresses such as heat shock trigger conserved responses: growth arrest, a specific transcriptional response, and biomolecular condensation of protein and mRNA into structures known as stress granules under severe stress. The composition, formation mechanism, adaptive significance, and even evolutionary conservation of these condensed structures remain enigmatic. Here we provide an unprecedented view into stress-triggered condensation, its evolutionary conservation and tuning, and its integration into other well-studied aspects of the stress response. Using three morphologically near-identical budding yeast species adapted to different thermal environments and diverged by up to 100 million years, we show that proteome-scale biomolecular condensation is tuned to species-specific thermal niches, closely tracking corresponding growth and transcriptional responses. In each species, poly(A)-binding protein--a core marker of stress granules--condenses in isolation at species-specific temperatures, with conserved molecular features and conformational changes modulating condensation. From the ecological to the molecular scale, our results reveal previously unappreciated levels of evolutionary selection in the eukaryotic stress response, while establishing a rich, tractable system for further inquiry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apicomplexans are ubiquitous intracellular parasites of animals. These parasites use a programmed sequence of secretory events to find, invade, and then reengineer their host cells to enable parasite growth and proliferation. The secretory organelles micronemes and rhoptries mediate the first steps of invasion. Both secrete their contents through the apical complex which provides an apical opening in the parasites elaborate inner membrane complex (IMC) -- an extensive subpellicular system of flattened membrane cisternae and proteinaceous meshwork that otherwise limits access of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for material exchange with the cell exterior. After invasion, a second secretion programme drives host cell remodelling and occurs from dense granules. The site(s) of dense granule exocytosis, however, has been unknown. In Toxoplasma gondii, small subapical annular structures that are embedded in the IMC have been observed, but the role or significance of these apical annuli to plasma membrane function has also been unknown. Here, we determined that integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane occur specifically at these apical annular sites, that these proteins include SNARE proteins, and that the apical annuli are sites of vesicle fusion and exocytosis. Specifically, we show that dense granules require these structures for the secretion of their cargo proteins. When secretion is perturbed at the apical annuli, parasite growth is arrested. The apical annuli, therefore, represent a second structure in the IMC specialised for protein secretion, and reveal that in Toxoplasma there is a physical separation of the processes of pre- and post-invasion secretion that mediate host-parasite interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exocytosis is a fundamental process used by all eukaryotic cells to regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and facilitate cell-cell communication. To investigate the role exocytosis plays in neuronal morphogenesis, previously we developed computational tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the automatic detection and analysis of exocytic events (ADAE GUI) from fluorescence timelapse images. Though these tools have proven useful, we found that the code was brittle and not easily adapted to different experimental conditions. Here, we developed and validated a robust and versatile toolkit, we have named pHusion, for the analysis of exocytosis written in Image-Tank, a graphical programming language that combines image visualization and numerical methods. We tested this method using a variety of imaging modalities and pH-sensitive fluorophores, diverse cell types, and various exocytic markers to generate a flexible and intuitive package. Using pHusion, we show that VAMP3-mediated exocytosis occurs 30-times more frequently in melanoma cells compared with primary oligodendrocytes, that VAMP2-mediated fusion events in mature rat hippocampal neurons are much longer lasting than those in immature murine cortical neurons, and that clustering of exocytic events occurs across cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cellular actin cortex provides crucial mechanical support and plays critical roles in numerous functions, including cell division and migration. The proteins of the ERM family, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are central to these processes by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the individual contributions of these three proteins to leukocyte migration, we generated single and triple ERM knock-out macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that even in the absence of ERMs, macrophages can still form the different actin structures promoting cell migration, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and ruffles. Furthermore we discovered that, unlike every other cell type previously investigated, the single or triple knock-out of ERMs does not affect macrophage migration in a large diversity of contexts. Finally, we demonstrated that the loss of ERMs in macrophages does not affect the mechanics of their actin cortex. These findings challenge the notion that ERMs are universally essential for cortex mechanics and cell migration and support the notion that the macrophage cortex may have diverged from that of other cells to allow for their adaptive cortical plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In thermogenic adipocytes, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is a key mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) by uncoupling the electron transport chain from FoF1-ATP synthase-mediated ATP production. While regulatory mechanisms of UCP1 are important for NST, it is unknown whether also the activity of ATP synthase is modulated during NST. Here, we show a critical role of Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, for brown adipocyte energy metabolism. In mice, IF1 protein content is diminished in brown adipose tissue of mice after 5 days of cold exposure. Additionally, the capacity of ATP synthase to generate mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through ATP hydrolysis (the so-called reverse mode) was higher in mitochondria isolated from cold-adapted mice compared to mice housed at room temperature. While silencing of IF1 in cultured brown adipocytes did not affect MMP, IF1 overexpression resulted in an inability of mitochondria to sustain MMP upon adrenergic stimulation. The effects of IF1 overexpression on MMP were blunted when UCP1 was silenced or when a mutant IF1, incapable of binding to ATP synthase, was used. In brown adipocytes, IF1 ablation was sufficient to increase mitochondrial lipid oxidation and the cellular dependency on glycolysis to produce ATP. Conversely, IF1 overexpression blunted mitochondrial respiration without causing energetic stress, leading to a quiescent-like phenotype in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that the cold-induced downregulation of IF1 facilitates the reverse mode of ATP synthase and enables proper bioenergetic adaptation of brown adipose tissue to effectively support NST.

        <p class="abstract">Skin is often the first physical barrier to encounter invading pathogens and physical damage. Damage to the skin must be resolved quickly and efficiently to maintain organ homeostasis. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to dynamically surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains epithelial keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are not well understood. Using skin explants from adult zebrafish, we show that Langerhans cells maintain normal surveillance activity following axonal degeneration and use their dynamic dendrites to engulf small axonal debris. By contrast, a ramified-to-rounded shape transition accommodates the engulfment of larger keratinocyte debris. We find that Langerhans cell dendrites are richly populated with actin and sensitive to a broad spectrum actin inhibitor. We further show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition leads to elongated dendrites, perturbed clearance of large debris, and reduced Langerhans cell migration to tissue-scale wounds. Altogether, our work describes the unique dynamics of Langerhans cells and involvement of the ROCK pathway in immune cell responses to damage of varying magnitude.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of chromatin at the nucleosome level inside cells is mysterious. Here we present in situ cryo-ET analyses of chromatin in both G1 and metaphase RPE-1 cells. G1 nucleosomes are concentrated in globular chromatin domains and metaphase nucleosomes are concentrated in the chromatids. Classification analysis reveals that canonical mononucleosomes, ordered stacked dinucleosomes, and mononucleosomes with a disordered gyre-proximal density are abundant in both cell-cycle states. Class averages that have more than two stacked nucleosomes or that have side-by-side dinucleosomes are not detected, suggesting that groups of more than two nucleosomes are heterogeneous. Large multi-megadalton structures are abundant in G1 nucleoplasm, but not found in G1 chromatin domains and metaphase chromatin. The macromolecular phenotypes studied here represent a starting point for the comparative analysis of condensation in normal and unhealthy human cells, in other cell-cycle states, other organisms, and in vitro chromatin assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Photomodulable fluorescent probes are drawing an increasing attention due to their applications in advanced bioimaging. Whereas photoconvertible probes can be advantageously used in tracking, photoswitchable probes constitute key tools for single molecule localization microscopy to perform super resolution imaging. Herein we shed light on a red and far-red BODIPY, namely BDP-576 and BDP-650 possessing both properties of conversion and switching. Our study demonstrates that theses pyrrolyl-BODIPYs respectively convert towards typical green- and red-emitting BODIPYs that are perfectly adapted to microscopy. We also showed that these pyrrolyl-BODIPYs undergo Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion, a photoconversion mechanism that we recently introduced and where the pyrrole moiety plays a central role. These unique features were used to develop targeted photoconvertible probes towards different organelles or subcellular units (plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, actin, Golgi apparatus, etc.) using chemical targeting moieties and Halo tag. We notably showed that BDP-650 could be used to track intracellular vesicles over more than 20 minutes in two color imaging with laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating its robustness. The switching properties of these photoconverters were studied at the single molecule level and were then successfully used in live Single Molecule Localization Microscopy in epithelial cells and neurons. Both membrane and mitochondria targeted probes could be used to decipher membrane 3D architecture and mitochondria dynamics at the nanoscale. This study builds a bridge between the photoconversion and photoswitching properties of probes undergoing directed photooxidation and shows the versatility and efficacy of this mechanism in live advanced imaging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Copper plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction. We found that during Leishmania major infection, the parasite-harboring macrophage regulates its copper homeostasis pathway in a way to facilitate copper-mediated neutralization of the pathogen. Copper-ATPase ATP7A transports copper to amastigote-harboring phagolysosomes to induce stress on parasites. Leishmania in order to evade the copper stress, utilizes a variety of manipulative measures to lower the host-induced copper stress. It induces deglycosylation and degradation of host-ATP7A and downregulation of copper importer, CTR1 by cysteine oxidation. Additionally, Leishmania induces CTR1 endocytosis that arrests copper uptake. In mouse model of infection, we report an increase in systemic bioavailable copper in infected animals. Heart acts as the major organ for diverting its copper reserves to systemic circulation to fight-off infection by downregulating its CTR1. Our study explores reciprocal mechanism of manipulation of host copper homeostasis pathway by macrophage and Leishmania to gain respective advantages in host-pathogen interaction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenesis requires building stable macromolecular structures from highly dynamic proteins. Muscles are anchored by long-lasting integrin adhesions to resist contractile force. However, the mechanisms governing integrin diffusion, immobilization, and activation within developing tissue remain elusive. Here, we show that actin polymerisation-driven membrane protrusions form nanotopographies resulting in strong adhesions in the Drosophila muscle attachment site. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that integrins assemble adhesive belts around Arp2/3-dependent actin protrusions, forming an invadosomes-like structure with membrane nanotopographies. Single protein tracking showed that, during MAS development, integrins exhibit enhanced molecular immobilization and confinement in diffusion traps formed by these membrane nanotopographies. Actin filaments also display restricted motion and confinement, indicating strong mechanical connection with integrins. Using isolated muscle cells, we show that substrate nanotopography, instead of rigidity, drives adhesion maturation by regulating actin protrusion, integrin diffusion and immobilization. These results point to the existence of a molecular clutch in developing tissue required for the formation of stable adhesions and highlight the importance of geometrical information in cellular and tissue morphogenesis.</p>
