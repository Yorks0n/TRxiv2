The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.\nRNA binding proteins and glycoRNAs form domains on the cell surface for cell penetrating peptide entry\nAuthors: Perr, J.; Langen, A.; Almahayni, K.; Nestola, G.; Chai, P.; Lebedenko, C.; Volk, R.; Caldwell, R.; Spiekermann, M.; Hemberger, H.; Bisaria, N.; Tzelepis, K.; Calo, E.; Mockl, L.; Zaro, B.; Flynn, R. A.\nScore: 53.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556039\nThe composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.\nPervasive mislocalization of pathogenic coding variants underlying human disorders\nAuthors: Lacoste, J.; Haghighi, M.; Haider, S.; Lin, Z.-Y.; Segal, D.; Reno, C.; Qian, W. W.; Xiong, X.; Shafqat-Abbasi, H.; Ryder, P.; Senft, R.; Cimini, B.; Roth, F.; Calderwood, M.; Hill, D.; Vidal, M.; Yi, S.; Sahni, N.; Peng, J.; Gingras, A.-C.; Singh, S.; Carpenter, A.; Taipale, M.\nScore: 35.4, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556368\nWidespread sequencing has yielded thousands of missense variants predicted or confirmed as disease-causing. This creates a new bottleneck: determining the functional impact of each variant - largely a painstaking, customized process undertaken one or a few genes or variants at a time. Here, we established a high-throughput imaging platform to assay the impact of coding variation on protein localization, evaluating 3,547 missense variants of over 1,000 genes and phenotypes. We discovered that mislocalization is a common consequence of coding variation, affecting about one-sixth of all pathogenic missense variants, all cellular compartments, and recessive and dominant disorders alike. Mislocalization is primarily driven by effects on protein stability and membrane insertion rather than disruptions of trafficking signals or specific interactions. Furthermore, mislocalization patterns help explain pleiotropy and disease severity and provide insights on variants of unknown significance. Our publicly available resource will likely accelerate the understanding of coding variation in human diseases.\nLipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases\nAuthors: Li, D.; Rocha Roa, C.; Schilling, M. A.; Reinisch, K.; Vanni, S.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555937\nGlycerophospholipids are synthesized primarily in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and must be equilibrated between bilayer leaflets to allow the ER and membranes derived from it to grow. Lipid equilibration is facilitated by integral membrane proteins called \"scramblases\". These proteins feature a hydrophilic groove allowing the polar heads of lipids to traverse the hydrophobic membrane interior, similar to a credit-card moving through a reader. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental role in membrane expansion and dynamics, the identity of most scramblases has remained elusive. Here, combining biochemical reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases, integral membrane proteins which insert polypeptide chains into membranes of the ER and organelles disconnected from vesicle trafficking. Our data indicate that lipid scrambling occurs in the same hydrophilic channel through which protein insertion takes place, and that scrambling is abolished in the presence of nascent polypeptide chains. We propose that protein insertases could have a so-far overlooked role in membrane dynamics as scramblases.\nStructure of Native Chromatin Fibres Revealed by Cryo-ET in situ\nAuthors: Hou, Z.; Nightingale, F.; Zhu, Y.; MacGregor-Chatwin, C.; Zhang, P.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556082\nThe structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.\nUnraveling human hematopoietic progenitor cell diversity through association with intrinsic regulatory factors\nAuthors: Favaro, P.; Glass, D. R.; Borges, L.; Reemar, R. B.; Reynolds, W.; Ho, D.; Bruce, T.; Tebaykin, D.; Scalon, V. M.; Shestopalov, I.; Bendall, S. C.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555623\nHematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is an essential therapy for hematological conditions, but finer definitions of human HSPC subsets with associated function could enable better tuning of grafts and more routine, lower-risk application. To deeply phenotype HSPCs, following a screen of 328 antigens, we quantified 41 surface proteins and functional regulators on millions of CD34+ and CD34- cells, spanning four primary human hematopoietic tissues: bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and fetal liver. We propose more granular definitions of HSPC subsets and provide new, detailed differentiation trajectories of erythroid and myeloid lineages. These aspects of our revised human hematopoietic model were validated with corresponding epigenetic analysis and in vitro clonal differentiation assays. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of using molecular regulators as surrogates for cellular identity and functional potential, providing a framework for description, prospective isolation, and cross-tissue comparison of HSPCs in humans.\nheterotypic interaction promotes asymmetric division of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells\nAuthors: Candelas, A.; Vianay, B.; Gelin, M.; Faivre, L.; Larghero, J.; Blanchoin, L.; Thery, M.; Brunet, S.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555706\nHematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) give rise to all cell types of the hematopoietic system through various processes including asymmetric divisions. However, the contribution of stromal cells of the hematopoietic niches in the control of HSPC asymmetric divisions remains unknown. Using polyacrylamide microwells as minimalist niches, we show that heterotypic interaction with osteoblast promotes asymmetric division of human HSPC. Upon interaction, HSPCs polarize in interphase with centrosome, the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes positioned close to the site of contact. Subsequently during mitosis, HSPCs orient their spindle perpendicular to the plane of contact. This division gives rise to siblings with unequal amounts of lysosomes and differentiation markers such as CD34. Such asymmetric inheritance generates heterogeneity in the progeny, which is likely to be a key contributor to the plasticity of the early steps of hematopoiesis.\nWeak neuronal glycolysis sustains cognition and organismal fitness\nAuthors: Jimenez-Blasco, D.; Agulla, J.; Lapresa, R.; Garcia-Macia, M.; Bobo-Jimenez, V.; Garcia-Rodriguez, D.; Manjarres-Raza, I.; Fernandez, E.; Jeanson, Y.; Khoury, S.; Portais, J.-C.; Padro, D.; Ramos-Cabrer, P.; Carmeliet, P.; Almeida, A.; Bolanos, J. P.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556016\nThe energy cost of neuronal activity is mainly sustained by glucose1,2. However, in an apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis3,4,5,6, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3)3,7,8, a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD+ reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.\nImaging of existing and newly translated proteins elucidates the mechanisms of sarcomere turnover\nAuthors: Douvdevany, G.; Erlich, I.; Haimovich-Caspi, L.; Prondzynski, M.; Pricolo, M. R.; Alegre-Cebollada, J.; Linke, W. A.; Carrier, L.; Kehat, I.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555653\nHow the sarcomeric complex is continuously turned-over in long-living cardiomyocytes is unclear. Here, we imaged the exchange of old and new Halo-tagged sarcomeric proteins. We disprove the prevailing protein pool model and instead show an ordered mechanism in which only newly translated proteins enter the sarcomeric complex while older ones are removed and degraded. We also show that degradation is independent of protein age, and that proteolytic extraction is a rate limiting step in the turnover. We imaged and quantified the turnover of expressed and endogenous sarcomeric proteins, including the giant protein titin, in cardiomyocytes in culture and in vivo, at the single cell and at the single sarcomere level. We show that replacement occurs at a similar rate within cells and across the heart and is markedly slower in adult cells. Our findings imply a new model of sarcomere turnover and sarcomeric subunit replacement.\nParkin is not required to sustain OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues\nAuthors: Filograna, R.; Gerlach, J.; Choi, H.-N.; Rigoni, G.; Barbaro, M.; Oscarson, M.; Lee, S.; Tiklova, K.; Ringner, M.; Koolmeister, C.; Wibom, R.; Riggare, S.; Nennesmo, I.; Perlmann, T.; Wredenberg, A.; Wedell, A.; Motori, E.; Svenningsson, P.; Larsson, N.-G.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556020\nLoss-of-function variants in the PRKN gene encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase PARKIN cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that PARKIN is involved in multiple pathways of mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial degradation and biogenesis. However, these findings are surrounded by substantial controversy due to conflicting experimental data. In addition, the existing PARKIN-deficient mouse models have failed to faithfully recapitulate PD phenotypes. Therefore, we have investigated the mitochondrial role of PARKIN during ageing and in response to stress by employing a series of conditional Parkin knockout mice. We report that PARKIN loss does not affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of aged mice. We also demonstrate that PARKIN deficiency does not exacerbate the brain defects and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in mice carrying high levels of mtDNA mutations. To rule out compensatory mechanisms activated during embryonic development of Parkin-deficient mice, we generated a mouse model where loss of PARKIN was induced in adult dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Surprisingly, also these mice did not show motor impairment or neurodegeneration, and no major transcriptional changes were found in isolated midbrain DA neurons. Finally, we report a patient with compound heterozygous PRKN pathogenic variants that lacks PARKIN and has developed PD. The PARKIN deficiency did not impair OXPHOS activities or induce mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle from the patient. Altogether, our results argue that PARKIN is dispensable for OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Widespread sequencing has yielded thousands of missense variants predicted or confirmed as disease-causing. This creates a new bottleneck: determining the functional impact of each variant - largely a painstaking, customized process undertaken one or a few genes or variants at a time. Here, we established a high-throughput imaging platform to assay the impact of coding variation on protein localization, evaluating 3,547 missense variants of over 1,000 genes and phenotypes. We discovered that mislocalization is a common consequence of coding variation, affecting about one-sixth of all pathogenic missense variants, all cellular compartments, and recessive and dominant disorders alike. Mislocalization is primarily driven by effects on protein stability and membrane insertion rather than disruptions of trafficking signals or specific interactions. Furthermore, mislocalization patterns help explain pleiotropy and disease severity and provide insights on variants of unknown significance. Our publicly available resource will likely accelerate the understanding of coding variation in human diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glycerophospholipids are synthesized primarily in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and must be equilibrated between bilayer leaflets to allow the ER and membranes derived from it to grow. Lipid equilibration is facilitated by integral membrane proteins called &#34;scramblases&#34;. These proteins feature a hydrophilic groove allowing the polar heads of lipids to traverse the hydrophobic membrane interior, similar to a credit-card moving through a reader. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental role in membrane expansion and dynamics, the identity of most scramblases has remained elusive. Here, combining biochemical reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases, integral membrane proteins which insert polypeptide chains into membranes of the ER and organelles disconnected from vesicle trafficking. Our data indicate that lipid scrambling occurs in the same hydrophilic channel through which protein insertion takes place, and that scrambling is abolished in the presence of nascent polypeptide chains. We propose that protein insertases could have a so-far overlooked role in membrane dynamics as scramblases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is an essential therapy for hematological conditions, but finer definitions of human HSPC subsets with associated function could enable better tuning of grafts and more routine, lower-risk application. To deeply phenotype HSPCs, following a screen of 328 antigens, we quantified 41 surface proteins and functional regulators on millions of CD34&#43; and CD34- cells, spanning four primary human hematopoietic tissues: bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and fetal liver. We propose more granular definitions of HSPC subsets and provide new, detailed differentiation trajectories of erythroid and myeloid lineages. These aspects of our revised human hematopoietic model were validated with corresponding epigenetic analysis and in vitro clonal differentiation assays. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of using molecular regulators as surrogates for cellular identity and functional potential, providing a framework for description, prospective isolation, and cross-tissue comparison of HSPCs in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) give rise to all cell types of the hematopoietic system through various processes including asymmetric divisions. However, the contribution of stromal cells of the hematopoietic niches in the control of HSPC asymmetric divisions remains unknown. Using polyacrylamide microwells as minimalist niches, we show that heterotypic interaction with osteoblast promotes asymmetric division of human HSPC. Upon interaction, HSPCs polarize in interphase with centrosome, the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes positioned close to the site of contact. Subsequently during mitosis, HSPCs orient their spindle perpendicular to the plane of contact. This division gives rise to siblings with unequal amounts of lysosomes and differentiation markers such as CD34. Such asymmetric inheritance generates heterogeneity in the progeny, which is likely to be a key contributor to the plasticity of the early steps of hematopoiesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The energy cost of neuronal activity is mainly sustained by glucose1,2. However, in an apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis3,4,5,6, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3)3,7,8, a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD&#43; reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How the sarcomeric complex is continuously turned-over in long-living cardiomyocytes is unclear. Here, we imaged the exchange of old and new Halo-tagged sarcomeric proteins. We disprove the prevailing  protein pool model and instead show an ordered mechanism in which only newly translated proteins enter the sarcomeric complex while older ones are removed and degraded. We also show that degradation is independent of protein age, and that proteolytic extraction is a rate limiting step in the turnover. We imaged and quantified the turnover of expressed and endogenous sarcomeric proteins, including the giant protein titin, in cardiomyocytes in culture and in vivo, at the single cell and at the single sarcomere level. We show that replacement occurs at a similar rate within cells and across the heart and is markedly slower in adult cells. Our findings imply a new model of sarcomere turnover and sarcomeric subunit replacement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss-of-function variants in the PRKN gene encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase PARKIN cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that PARKIN is involved in multiple pathways of mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial degradation and biogenesis. However, these findings are surrounded by substantial controversy due to conflicting experimental data. In addition, the existing PARKIN-deficient mouse models have failed to faithfully recapitulate PD phenotypes. Therefore, we have investigated the mitochondrial role of PARKIN during ageing and in response to stress by employing a series of conditional Parkin knockout mice. We report that PARKIN loss does not affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of aged mice. We also demonstrate that PARKIN deficiency does not exacerbate the brain defects and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in mice carrying high levels of mtDNA mutations. To rule out compensatory mechanisms activated during embryonic development of Parkin-deficient mice, we generated a mouse model where loss of PARKIN was induced in adult dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Surprisingly, also these mice did not show motor impairment or neurodegeneration, and no major transcriptional changes were found in isolated midbrain DA neurons. Finally, we report a patient with compound heterozygous PRKN pathogenic variants that lacks PARKIN and has developed PD. The PARKIN deficiency did not impair OXPHOS activities or induce mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle from the patient. Altogether, our results argue that PARKIN is dispensable for OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues.</p>
