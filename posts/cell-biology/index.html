To address this gap, we developed scTF-seq, a technique inducing single-cell barcoded and doxycycline-inducible TF overexpression while quantifying TF dose-dependent transcriptomic changes. Applied to mouse embryonic multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), scTF-seq produced a gain-of-function atlas for 384 murine TFs. This atlas offers a valuable resource for gene regulation and reprogramming research, identifying key TFs governing MSC lineage differentiation, cell cycle control, and their interplay. Leveraging the single-cell resolution, we dissected reprogramming heterogeneity along dose and pseudotime. We thereby revealed TF dose-dependent and stochastic cell fate branching, unveiling gene expression signatures that enhance our understanding and prediction of reprogramming efficiency. scTF-seq also allowed us to classify TFs into four sensitivity classes based on dose response and determining features. Finally, in combinatorial scTF-seq, we observed that the same TF can exhibit both synergistic and antagonistic effects on another TF depending on its dose. In summary, scTF-seq provides a powerful tool for gaining mechanistic insights into how TFs determine cell states, while offering novel perspectives for cellular engineering strategies.\nCryosectioning-enabled super-resolution microscopy for studying nuclear architecture at the single protein level\nAuthors: Stein, J.; Ericsson, M.; Nofal, M.; Magni, L.; Aufmkolk, S.; McMillan, R. B.; Breimann, L.; Herlihy, C. P.; Lee, S. D.; Willemin, A.; Wohlmann, J.; Arguedas-Jimenez, L.; Yin, P.; Pombo, A.; Church, G. M.; Wu, C.-t.\nScore: 42.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.576943\nDNA-PAINT combined with total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy enables the highest localization precisions, down to single nanometers in thin biological samples, due to TIRFs unique method for optical sectioning and attaining high contrast. However, most cellular targets elude the accessible TIRF range close to the cover glass and thus require alternative imaging conditions, affecting resolution and image quality. Here, we address this limitation by applying ultrathin physical cryosectioning in combination with DNA-PAINT. With \"tomographic \u0026 kinetically-enhanced\" DNA-PAINT (tokPAINT), we demonstrate the imaging of nuclear proteins with sub-3 nanometer localization precision, advancing the quantitative study of nuclear organization within fixed cells and mouse tissues at the level of single antibodies. We believe that ultrathin sectioning combined with the versatility and multiplexing capabilities of DNA-PAINT will be a powerful addition to the toolbox of quantitative DNA-based super-resolution microscopy in intracellular structural analyses of proteins, RNA and DNA in situ.\nNuclear pores safeguard the integrity of the nuclear envelope\nAuthors: Taniguchi, R.; Orniacki, C.; Kreysing, J. P.; Zila, V.; Zimmerli, C. E.; Boehm, S.; Turonova, B.; Kraeusslich, H.-G.; Doye, V.; Beck, M.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578890\nNuclear pore complexes (NPCs) constitute giant channels within the nuclear envelope that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. NPC diameter is thought to be regulated by nuclear envelope tension, but how such diameter changes are physiologically linked to cell differentiation, where mechanical properties of nuclei are remodeled and nuclear mechanosensing occurs, remains unstudied. Here we used cryo-electron tomography to show that NPCs dilate during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors. In Nup133-deficient cells, which are known to display impaired neural differentiation, NPCs however fail to dilate. By analyzing the architectures of individual NPCs with template matching, we revealed that the Nup133-deficient NPCs are structurally heterogeneous and frequently disintegrate, resulting in the formation of large nuclear envelope openings. We propose that the elasticity of the NPC scaffold mechanically safeguards the nuclear envelope. Our studies provide a molecular explanation for how genetic perturbation of scaffolding components of macromolecular complexes causes tissue-specific phenotypes.\nBRD4-mediated epigenetic regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites is governed by the mitochondrial complex III\nAuthors: Chen, B.; Lynn-Nguyen, T.

M.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578646\nInter-organellar communication is critical for cellular metabolic homeostasis. One of the most abundant inter-organellar interactions are those at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing ERMCS regulation and their roles in cellular metabolism are limited by a lack of tools that permit temporal induction and reversal. Through unbiased screening approaches, we identified fedratinib, an FDA-approved drug, that dramatically increases ERMCS abundance by inhibiting the epigenetic modifier BRD4. Fedratinib rapidly and reversibly modulates mitochondrial and ER morphology and alters metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, ERMCS modulation depends on mitochondria electron transport chain complex III function. Comparison of fedratinib activity to other reported inducers of ERMCS revealed common mechanisms of induction and function, providing clarity and union to a growing body of experimental observations. In total, our results uncovered a novel epigenetic signaling pathway and an endogenous metabolic regulator that connects ERMCS and cellular metabolism.\nPlasmodium NEK1 coordinates MTOC organisation and kinetochore attachment during rapid mitosis in male gamete formation\nAuthors: Zeeshan, M.; Rashpa, R.; Ferguson, D.

C.; Brochet, M.; Tewari, R.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578160\nMitosis is an important process in the cell cycle required for cells to divide. Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within eight minutes followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes. Our previous Plasmodium kinome screen identified four Nek genes, of which two, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that Plasmodium NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.\nA β-catenin:MSI2 axis regulates the expression of LEF1 and subsequent human haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation\nAuthors: Morgan, R. G.; Wagstaff, M.; Nguyen, D. T.; Blair, A.; Towler, B. P.; Newbury, S. F.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577638\nWnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is important for normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) biology and heavily implicated in many hematological malignancies. The central mediator, {beta}-catenin, is an attractive therapeutic target in myeloid neoplasms however, the design of targeted agents has been hampered by a limited understanding of its molecular interactions in hematopoietic cells. To address this shortfall, we recently published the first {beta}-catenin interactome (Morgan et al, 2019) in haematological cells and identified a plethora of novel partners which included the significant enrichment of RNA binding proteins (Wagstaff et al, 2022), including Musashi-2 (MSI2). MSI2 has been extensively implicated in normal HSC activity and also promotes aggressive myeloid leukemias where its expression confers inferior survival. Interaction between MSI2 and Wnt signalling has not previously been reported in a hematopoietic context. In this study we identify an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in both myeloid cell lines and primary AML patient samples where there is a significant degree of correlation between the proteins. We demonstrate that MSI2 can impact Wnt signalling output (TCF/LEF activity) through modulating LEF-1 expression and localization, and that MSI2 can further bind LEF1 transcript, an interaction augmented by {beta}-catenin. Finally, we show that MSI2 mediated expansion of HSPCs could be partly driven through LEF1 regulation. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in haematopoietic cells, and shows the potential for {beta}-catenin to cooperate with RBPs to govern HSPC proliferation. Finally, these data indicate {beta}-catenin may also serve critical post-transcriptional functions (in addition to transcriptional roles) in haematopoietic cells, which could extend to regulating expression of Wnt signalling components.\nCa2+-sensor ALG-2 engages ESCRTs to enhance lysosomal membrane resilience to osmotic stress\nAuthors: Chen, W.; Motsinger, M. M.; Li, J.; Bohannon, K. P.; Hanson, P. I.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578682\nLysosomes are central players in cellular catabolism, signaling, and metabolic regulation. Cellular and environmental stresses that damage lysosomal membranes can compromise their function and release toxic content into the cytoplasm. Here, we examine how cells respond to osmotic stress within lysosomes. Using sensitive assays of lysosomal leakage and rupture, we examine acute effects of the cathepsin C-metabolized osmotic disruptant glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN). Our findings reveal that widely used concentrations of GPN rupture only a small fraction of lysosomes, but surprisingly trigger Ca2+ release from nearly all. Chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+ using BAPTA makes lysosomes more likely to rupture under GPN-induced stress, suggesting that Ca2+ plays a role in protecting or rapidly repairing lysosomal membranes. Mechanistically, we establish that GPN causes the Ca2+-sensitive protein Apoptosis Linked Gene-2 (ALG-2) and interacting ESCRT proteins to redistribute onto lysosomes, improving their resistance to membrane stress created by GPN as well as the lysosomotropic drug chlorpromazine. Furthermore, we show that activating the cation channel TRPML1, with or without blocking the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, creates local Ca2+ signals that protect lysosomes from rupture by recruiting ALG-2 and ESCRTs without any membrane damage. These findings reveal that Ca2+, through ALG-2, helps bring ESCRTs to lysosomes to enhance their resilience and maintain organelle integrity in the face of osmotic stress. SIGNIFICANCEAs the degradative hub of the cell, lysosomes are full of toxic content that can spill into the cytoplasm. There has been much recent interest in how cells sense and repair lysosomal membrane damage using ESCRTs and cholesterol to rapidly fix \"nanoscale damage\". Here, we extend understanding of how ESCRTs contribute by uncovering a preventative role of the ESCRT machinery. We show that ESCRTs, when recruited by the Ca2+-sensor ALG-2, play a critical role in stabilizing the lysosomal membrane against osmotically-induced rupture. This finding suggests that cells have mechanisms not just for repairing but also for actively protecting lysosomes from stress-induced membrane damage.\nThe Vps13-like protein BLTP2 is pro-survival and regulates phosphatidylethanolamine levels in the plasma membrane to maintain its fluidity and function\nAuthors: Banerjee, S.; Daetwyler, S.; Bai, X.; Michaud, M.; Jouhet, J.; Madhugiri, S.; Johnson, E.; Wang, C.-W.; Fiolka, R.; Toulmay, A.; Prinz, W. A.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578804\nLipid transport proteins (LTPs) facilitate nonvesicular lipid exchange between cellular compartments and have critical roles in lipid homeostasis1. A new family of bridge-like LTPs (BLTPs) is thought to form lipid-transporting conduits between organelles2. One, BLTP2, is conserved across species but its function is not known. Here, we show that BLTP2 and its homolog directly regulate plasma membrane (PM) fluidity by increasing the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) level in the PM. BLTP2 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-PM contact sites3 4, 5, suggesting it transports PE from the ER to the PM. We find BLTP2 works in parallel with another pathway that regulates intracellular PE distribution and PM fluidity6, 7. BLTP2 expression correlates with breast cancer aggressiveness8-10. We found BLTP2 facilitates growth of a human cancer cell line and sustains its aggressiveness in an in vivo model of metastasis, suggesting maintenance of PM fluidity by BLTP2 may be critical for tumorigenesis in humans.\nSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals cellular and molecular dynamics of white and brown adipose tissue in a mouse model of type-2 diabetes\nAuthors: Gaynor, T. L.; Hsu, I.; Krstevski, C.; Farrugia, G. E.; Dona, M. S.; Cohen, C. D.; Drew, B. G.; Pinto, A. R.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.578860\nExcessive adipose tissue expansion is often linked with type-2 diabetes. Despite recent efforts mapping adipose tissue changes in obesity using single-cell omics, an understanding of cellular and gene expression changes in a model of type 2 diabetes, and the transcriptional circuitry controlling it, is still lacking. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyse the remodelling of gonadal white and interscapular brown adipose tissue from female and male mice with or without diabetes. Analysis of 51,877 nuclei revealed altered phenotypes in every cell population in type 2 diabetes. This included an immunoregulatory response, and changes in extracellular matrix organisation, energy generation, and hormone stimuli. Key transcription factors were inferred as cell-specific and non-specific nodes controlling diabetes-linked phenotypes. Finally, female-to-male population heterogeneity and gene expression differences were observed. Here we provide a resource detailing how adipose tissue remodelling, and the molecular mechanisms governing it, may contribute to cardiometabolic disease.\nCa2+-driven cytoplasmic backflow secures spindle position in fertilized mouse eggs\nAuthors: Totsuka, T.; Ohsugi, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578955\nAbstractFertilization triggers hours-long Ca2+ oscillations in mammalian eggs, but the effects of repeated Ca2+ surges remain unclear. Here, we investigate spindle dynamics and its relationship with cytoplasmic streaming in fertilized mouse eggs. The spindle, initially parallel to the plasma membrane, rotates vertically, in accordance with previously reported results using artificially activated eggs. Intriguingly, it transiently reverses its rotation direction in synchrony with Ca2+ oscillations, regardless of artificially altered frequency. This effect results from cytoplasmic streaming, initially moving from spindle to egg center, displaying a Ca2+-dependent backflow. Streaming also impacts spindle positioning, balancing spindle rotation and cortical localization maintenance. We provide evidence that Ca2+-dependent cortical myosin II activation causes actomyosin contraction, leading to transient streaming towards non-contracting actin cap regions overlaying chromosomes. Our findings underscore the role of Ca2+ oscillations in maintaining spindle position in fertilized eggs, thereby ensuring highly asymmetric division and preservation of maternal stores in zygotes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Reprogramming approaches often produce heterogeneous cell fates and the mechanisms behind this heterogeneity are not well-understood. To address this gap, we developed scTF-seq, a technique inducing single-cell barcoded and doxycycline-inducible TF overexpression while quantifying TF dose-dependent transcriptomic changes. Applied to mouse embryonic multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), scTF-seq produced a gain-of-function atlas for 384 murine TFs. This atlas offers a valuable resource for gene regulation and reprogramming research, identifying key TFs governing MSC lineage differentiation, cell cycle control, and their interplay. Leveraging the single-cell resolution, we dissected reprogramming heterogeneity along dose and pseudotime. We thereby revealed TF dose-dependent and stochastic cell fate branching, unveiling gene expression signatures that enhance our understanding and prediction of reprogramming efficiency. scTF-seq also allowed us to classify TFs into four sensitivity classes based on dose response and determining features. Finally, in combinatorial scTF-seq, we observed that the same TF can exhibit both synergistic and antagonistic effects on another TF depending on its dose. In summary, scTF-seq provides a powerful tool for gaining mechanistic insights into how TFs determine cell states, while offering novel perspectives for cellular engineering strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA-PAINT combined with total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy enables the highest localization precisions, down to single nanometers in thin biological samples, due to TIRFs unique method for optical sectioning and attaining high contrast. However, most cellular targets elude the accessible TIRF range close to the cover glass and thus require alternative imaging conditions, affecting resolution and image quality. Here, we address this limitation by applying ultrathin physical cryosectioning in combination with DNA-PAINT. With &#34;tomographic &amp; kinetically-enhanced&#34; DNA-PAINT (tokPAINT), we demonstrate the imaging of nuclear proteins with sub-3 nanometer localization precision, advancing the quantitative study of nuclear organization within fixed cells and mouse tissues at the level of single antibodies. We believe that ultrathin sectioning combined with the versatility and multiplexing capabilities of DNA-PAINT will be a powerful addition to the toolbox of quantitative DNA-based super-resolution microscopy in intracellular structural analyses of proteins, RNA and DNA in situ.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) constitute giant channels within the nuclear envelope that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. NPC diameter is thought to be regulated by nuclear envelope tension, but how such diameter changes are physiologically linked to cell differentiation, where mechanical properties of nuclei are remodeled and nuclear mechanosensing occurs, remains unstudied. Here we used cryo-electron tomography to show that NPCs dilate during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors. In Nup133-deficient cells, which are known to display impaired neural differentiation, NPCs however fail to dilate. By analyzing the architectures of individual NPCs with template matching, we revealed that the Nup133-deficient NPCs are structurally heterogeneous and frequently disintegrate, resulting in the formation of large nuclear envelope openings. We propose that the elasticity of the NPC scaffold mechanically safeguards the nuclear envelope. Our studies provide a molecular explanation for how genetic perturbation of scaffolding components of macromolecular complexes causes tissue-specific phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-organellar communication is critical for cellular metabolic homeostasis. One of the most abundant inter-organellar interactions are those at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing ERMCS regulation and their roles in cellular metabolism are limited by a lack of tools that permit temporal induction and reversal. Through unbiased screening approaches, we identified fedratinib, an FDA-approved drug, that dramatically increases ERMCS abundance by inhibiting the epigenetic modifier BRD4. Fedratinib rapidly and reversibly modulates mitochondrial and ER morphology and alters metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, ERMCS modulation depends on mitochondria electron transport chain complex III function. Comparison of fedratinib activity to other reported inducers of ERMCS revealed common mechanisms of induction and function, providing clarity and union to a growing body of experimental observations. In total, our results uncovered a novel epigenetic signaling pathway and an endogenous metabolic regulator that connects ERMCS and cellular metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitosis is an important process in the cell cycle required for cells to divide. Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within eight minutes followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes.

Our previous Plasmodium kinome screen identified four Nek genes, of which two, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that Plasmodium NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is important for normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) biology and heavily implicated in many hematological malignancies. The central mediator, {beta}-catenin, is an attractive therapeutic target in myeloid neoplasms however, the design of targeted agents has been hampered by a limited understanding of its molecular interactions in hematopoietic cells. To address this shortfall, we recently published the first {beta}-catenin interactome (Morgan et al, 2019) in haematological cells and identified a plethora of novel partners which included the significant enrichment of RNA binding proteins (Wagstaff et al, 2022), including Musashi-2 (MSI2). MSI2 has been extensively implicated in normal HSC activity and also promotes aggressive myeloid leukemias where its expression confers inferior survival. Interaction between MSI2 and Wnt signalling has not previously been reported in a hematopoietic context. In this study we identify an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in both myeloid cell lines and primary AML patient samples where there is a significant degree of correlation between the proteins. We demonstrate that MSI2 can impact Wnt signalling output (TCF/LEF activity) through modulating LEF-1 expression and localization, and that MSI2 can further bind LEF1 transcript, an interaction augmented by {beta}-catenin. Finally, we show that MSI2 mediated expansion of HSPCs could be partly driven through LEF1 regulation. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an interaction between MSI2 and {beta}-catenin in haematopoietic cells, and shows the potential for {beta}-catenin to cooperate with RBPs to govern HSPC proliferation. Finally, these data indicate {beta}-catenin may also serve critical post-transcriptional functions (in addition to transcriptional roles) in haematopoietic cells, which could extend to regulating expression of Wnt signalling components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lysosomes are central players in cellular catabolism, signaling, and metabolic regulation. Cellular and environmental stresses that damage lysosomal membranes can compromise their function and release toxic content into the cytoplasm. Here, we examine how cells respond to osmotic stress within lysosomes. Using sensitive assays of lysosomal leakage and rupture, we examine acute effects of the cathepsin C-metabolized osmotic disruptant glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN). Our findings reveal that widely used concentrations of GPN rupture only a small fraction of lysosomes, but surprisingly trigger Ca2&#43; release from nearly all. Chelating cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; using BAPTA makes lysosomes more likely to rupture under GPN-induced stress, suggesting that Ca2&#43; plays a role in protecting or rapidly repairing lysosomal membranes. Mechanistically, we establish that GPN causes the Ca2&#43;-sensitive protein Apoptosis Linked Gene-2 (ALG-2) and interacting ESCRT proteins to redistribute onto lysosomes, improving their resistance to membrane stress created by GPN as well as the lysosomotropic drug chlorpromazine. Furthermore, we show that activating the cation channel TRPML1, with or without blocking the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2&#43; pump, creates local Ca2&#43; signals that protect lysosomes from rupture by recruiting ALG-2 and ESCRTs without any membrane damage. These findings reveal that Ca2&#43;, through ALG-2, helps bring ESCRTs to lysosomes to enhance their resilience and maintain organelle integrity in the face of osmotic stress.

SIGNIFICANCEAs the degradative hub of the cell, lysosomes are full of toxic content that can spill into the cytoplasm. There has been much recent interest in how cells sense and repair lysosomal membrane damage using ESCRTs and cholesterol to rapidly fix &#34;nanoscale damage&#34;. Here, we extend understanding of how ESCRTs contribute by uncovering a preventative role of the ESCRT machinery. We show that ESCRTs, when recruited by the Ca2&#43;-sensor ALG-2, play a critical role in stabilizing the lysosomal membrane against osmotically-induced rupture. This finding suggests that cells have mechanisms not just for repairing but also for actively protecting lysosomes from stress-induced membrane damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lipid transport proteins (LTPs) facilitate nonvesicular lipid exchange between cellular compartments and have critical roles in lipid homeostasis1. A new family of bridge-like LTPs (BLTPs) is thought to form lipid-transporting conduits between organelles2. One, BLTP2, is conserved across species but its function is not known. Here, we show that BLTP2 and its homolog directly regulate plasma membrane (PM) fluidity by increasing the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) level in the PM. BLTP2 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-PM contact sites3 4, 5, suggesting it transports PE from the ER to the PM. We find BLTP2 works in parallel with another pathway that regulates intracellular PE distribution and PM fluidity6, 7. BLTP2 expression correlates with breast cancer aggressiveness8-10. We found BLTP2 facilitates growth of a human cancer cell line and sustains its aggressiveness in an in vivo model of metastasis, suggesting maintenance of PM fluidity by BLTP2 may be critical for tumorigenesis in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Excessive adipose tissue expansion is often linked with type-2 diabetes. Despite recent efforts mapping adipose tissue changes in obesity using single-cell omics, an understanding of cellular and gene expression changes in a model of type 2 diabetes, and the transcriptional circuitry controlling it, is still lacking. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyse the remodelling of gonadal white and interscapular brown adipose tissue from female and male mice with or without diabetes. Analysis of 51,877 nuclei revealed altered phenotypes in every cell population in type 2 diabetes. This included an immunoregulatory response, and changes in extracellular matrix organisation, energy generation, and hormone stimuli. Key transcription factors were inferred as cell-specific and non-specific nodes controlling diabetes-linked phenotypes. Finally, female-to-male population heterogeneity and gene expression differences were observed. Here we provide a resource detailing how adipose tissue remodelling, and the molecular mechanisms governing it, may contribute to cardiometabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractFertilization triggers hours-long Ca2&#43; oscillations in mammalian eggs, but the effects of repeated Ca2&#43; surges remain unclear. Here, we investigate spindle dynamics and its relationship with cytoplasmic streaming in fertilized mouse eggs. The spindle, initially parallel to the plasma membrane, rotates vertically, in accordance with previously reported results using artificially activated eggs. Intriguingly, it transiently reverses its rotation direction in synchrony with Ca2&#43; oscillations, regardless of artificially altered frequency. This effect results from cytoplasmic streaming, initially moving from spindle to egg center, displaying a Ca2&#43;-dependent backflow. Streaming also impacts spindle positioning, balancing spindle rotation and cortical localization maintenance. We provide evidence that Ca2&#43;-dependent cortical myosin II activation causes actomyosin contraction, leading to transient streaming towards non-contracting actin cap regions overlaying chromosomes. Our findings underscore the role of Ca2&#43; oscillations in maintaining spindle position in fertilized eggs, thereby ensuring highly asymmetric division and preservation of maternal stores in zygotes.</p>
