A.; Angelidaki, D.-D.; Nuechel, J.; Pan, J.; Gollwitzer, P.; Elkis, Y.; Artoni, F.; Wilhelm, S.; Kovacevic-Sarmiento, M.; Demetriades, C.\nScore: 51.4, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.559930\nAmino acid (AA) availability is a robust determinant of cell growth, through controlling mTORC1 activity 1. According to the predominant model in the field, AA sufficiency drives the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface by the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, from where it coordinates the majority of cellular processes (reviewed in 2,3). Importantly, however, 15 years after its initial discovery, the teleonomy of the proposed lysosomal regulation of mTORC1, and where mTORC1 acts on its effector proteins remain enigmatic 4. Here, by using multiple pharmacological and genetic means to perturb the lysosomal AA sensing and protein recycling machineries, we describe the spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and downstream functions in mammalian cells, with lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 phosphorylating distinct substrates in response to different AA sources. Moreover, we reveal that a fraction of mTOR localizes at lysosomes due to basal lysosomal proteolysis that locally supplies new AAs, even in cells grown in the presence of extracellular nutrients, whereas cytoplasmic mTORC1 is regulated by exogenous AAs. Overall, our study substantially expands our knowledge about the topology of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, and hints at the existence of distinct, Rag- and lysosome-independent mechanisms that control its activity at other subcellular locations. Given the importance of mTORC1 signalling and AA sensing for human ageing and disease 2, our findings will likely open new directions toward the identification of function-specific mTORC1 regulators, and suggest new targets for drug discovery against conditions with dysregulated mTORC1 activity in the future.\nA DRP-like pseudoenzyme coordinates with MICOS to promote cristae architecture\nAuthors: Kumar, A.; Gok, M. O.; Nguyen, K. N.; Reese, M. L.; Wideman, J. G.; Munoz-Gomez, S. A.; Friedman, J. R.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560745\nMitochondrial cristae architecture is crucial for optimal respiratory function of the organelle. Cristae shape is maintained in part by the mitochondrial inner membrane-localized MICOS complex. While MICOS is required for normal cristae morphology, the precise mechanistic role of each of the seven human MICOS subunits, and how the complex coordinates with other cristae shaping factors, has not been fully determined. Here, we examine the MICOS complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a minimal model whose genome only encodes for four core subunits. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identify a poorly characterized inner mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with MICOS and is required to maintain cristae morphology, which we name Mmc1. We demonstrate that Mmc1 works in concert with MICOS complexes to promote normal mitochondrial morphology and respiratory function. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Mmc1 is a distant relative of the Dynamin-Related Protein (DRP) family of GTPases, which are well established to shape and remodel membranes. We find that, like DRPs, Mmc1 self-associates and forms high molecular weight assemblies. Interestingly, however, Mmc1 is a pseudoenzyme that lacks key residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis, suggesting it does not dynamically remodel membranes. These data are consistent with a model in which Mmc1 stabilizes cristae architecture by acting as a scaffold to support cristae ultrastructure on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Our study reveals a new class of proteins that evolved early in fungal phylogeny and is required for the maintenance of cristae architecture. This highlights the possibility that functionally analogous proteins work with MICOS to establish cristae morphology in metazoans.\nCytoplasmic fluidization triggers breaking spore dormancy in fission yeast.\nAuthors: Sakai, K.; Kondo, Y.; Goto, Y.; Aoki, K.\nScore: 27.3, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559686\nThe cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules ([~]3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking. Significance statementCellular processes are influenced by the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as crowding and viscoelasticity. Although it has been suggested that cells tune the cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental changes, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used the dormant fission yeast spores and uncovered signaling pathways that facilitate cytoplasmic fluidization during dormancy breaking. Furthermore, we tracked the mobility of intracellular tracer particles, and found that the spore cytoplasm impedes the mobility of larger protein complexes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules. These results suggest that small signaling proteins can diffuse relatively freely in the spore cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals, while the motion of large complexes, such as ribosomes, is restricted.\nA Flat Protein Complex Shapes Rough ER Membrane Sheets\nAuthors: Sawyer, E. M.; Jensen, L. E.; Meehl, J. B.; Larsen, K. P.; Petito, D. A.; Hurley, J. H.; Voeltz, G. K.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.559866\nRough ER sheets are a fundamental domain of the ER and the gateway into the secretory pathway. While reticulon proteins stabilize high-curvature ER tubules, it is unclear if other proteins scaffold the flat membranes of rough ER sheets. Through a proteomics screen using ER sheet localized RNA-binding proteins as bait, we identify the Sigma-1 receptor (SigmaR1) as an ER sheet shaping factor. High-resolution live cell imaging and electron tomography assign SigmaR1 as an ER sheet-localized factor whose levels determine the amount of rough ER sheets in cells. Structure-guided mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution on giant unilamellar vesicles further support a mechanism whereby SigmaR1 oligomers use their extended arrays of amphipathic helices to bind and flatten the lumenal leaflet of ER membranes. Our results demonstrate an unexpected way for proteins to sense and propagate flat membrane sheets.\nASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging\nAuthors: Odawara, T.; Yamauchi, S.; Ichijo, H.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558729\nCellular senescence is a stress-induced, permanent cell cycle arrest involved in tumor suppression and aging. Senescent cells secrete bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been implicated in immune-mediated elimination of senescent cells and age-associated chronic inflammation. However, the mechanisms regulating the SASP are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the stress-responsive kinase ASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging. ASK1 is activated during senescence and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activating p38, a kinase critical for the SASP. ASK1-deficient mice show impaired elimination of oncogene-induced senescent cells and an increased rate of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ASK1 deficiency prevents age-associated p38 activation and inflammation and attenuates glomerulosclerosis. Our results suggest that ASK1 is a driver of the SASP and age-associated chronic inflammation and represents a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.\nBBQ methods: Streamlined workflows for Bacterial Burden Quantification in infected cells by confocal microscopy\nAuthors: Augenstreich, J.; Shuster, M. J.; Lyu, Z.; Fan, Y.; Ling, J.; Briken, V.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560379\nAccurate quantification of bacterial burden within macrophages, termed Bacterial Burden Quantification (BBQ), is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions. Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden. These automated workflows offer valuable tools for studying bacterial interactions within host cells and provide insights for various research applications.\nA Window into Mammalian Basement Membrane Development: Insights from the mTurq2-Col4a1 Mouse Model\nAuthors: Jones, R. A.; Trejo, B.; Sil, P.; Little, K. A.; Pasolli, H. A.; Joyce, B.; Posfai, E.; Devenport, D.\nScore: 39.4, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559396\nBasement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The BMs inherent pliability enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.\nThe nuclear basket regulates distribution and mobility of nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast\nAuthors: Zsok, J.; Simon, F.; Bayrak, G.; Isaki, L.; Kerff, N.; Wolstenholme, A.; Weiss, L. E.; Dultz, E.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.558499\nNuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate all traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and are among the most stable protein assemblies in cells. Intriguingly, budding yeast cells carry two variants of NPCs which differ in the presence or absence of the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39. The binding of this basket structure is the last step of NPC assembly and Mlp-positive NPCs are excluded from the region of the nuclear envelope that is associated with the nucleolus. Here, we use recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) to investigate the stability of all the NPC subcomplexes within individual NPCs. We show that the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39 remain stably associated with NPCs through multiple cell-division cycles. Mlp1/2 are responsible for the exclusion of NPCs from the nucleolar territory, but an independent pathway via Nup2 also contributes to the depletion of Mlp-negative NPCs from this region. We developed a method for single NPC tracking in budding yeast and observed that NPCs exhibit increased mobility in the absence nuclear basket components. Our data suggest that the distribution of NPCs on the nucleus is governed by the nuclear basket proteins and is the result of interactions with chromatin or chromatin-associated factors.\nInduced pluripotent stem cell derived pericytes respond to endogenous mediators of proliferation and contractility\nAuthors: King, N. E.; Courtney, J.-M.; Brown, L. S.; Fortune, A. J.; Blackburn, N. B.; Fletcher, J. L.; Cashion, J. M.; Talbot, J.; Pebay, A.; Hewitt, A. W.; Morris, G. P.; Young, K. M.; Cook, A. L.; Sutherland, B. A.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560066\nBackgroundPericytes are multifunctional contractile cells that reside on capillaries. Pericytes are critical regulators of cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier function, and pericyte dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of human neurological diseases including Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pericytes (iPericytes) are a promising tool for vascular research. However, it is unclear how iPericytes functionally compare to primary human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs). We differentiated iPSCs into iPericytes of either the mesoderm or neural crest lineage using established protocols. We compared iPericyte and HBVP morphologies, quantified gene expression by qPCR and bulk RNA sequencing, and visualised pericyte protein markers by immunocytochemistry. To determine whether the gene expression of neural crest iPericytes, mesoderm iPericytes or HBVPs correlated with their functional characteristics in vitro, we quantified EdU incorporation following exposure to the key pericyte mitogen, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and, contraction and relaxation in response to the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 or vasodilator adenosine, respectively. iPericytes were morphologically similar to HBVPs and expressed canonical pericyte markers. However, iPericytes had 1864 differentially expressed genes compared to HBVPs, while there were 797 genes differentially expressed between neural crest and mesoderm iPericytes. Consistent with the ability of HBVPs to respond to PDGF-BB signalling, PDGF-BB enhanced and PDGF receptor-beta inhibitors impaired iPericyte proliferation. Administration of endothelin-1 led to iPericyte contraction and adenosine led to iPericyte relaxation, of a magnitude similar to the response evoked in HBVPs. We determined that neural crest iPericytes were less susceptible to PDGFR beta inhibition, but responded most robustly to vasoconstrictive meditators. iPericytes express pericyte-associated genes and proteins and, exhibit an appropriate physiological response upon exposure to a key endogenous mitogen or vasoactive mediators. Therefore, the generation of functional iPericytes would be suitable for use in future investigations exploring pericyte function or dysfunction in neurological diseases.\niPSC-based modeling of helicase deficiency reveals impaired cell proliferation and increased apoptosis after NK cell lineage commitment\nAuthors: Seo, S.; Patil, S. L.; Ahn, Y.-O.; Armetta, J.; Hegewisch-Solloa, E.; Castillo, M.; Guilz, N. C.; Patel, A.; Corneo, B.; Borowiak, M.; Gunaratne, P.; Mace, E. M.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559149\nCell proliferation is a ubiquitous process required for organismal development and homeostasis. However, individuals with partial loss-of-function variants in DNA replicative helicase components often present with immunodeficiency due to specific loss of natural killer (NK) cells. Such lineage-specific disease phenotypes raise questions on how the proliferation is regulated in cell type-specific manner. We aimed to understand NK cell-specific proliferative dynamics and vulnerability to impaired helicase function using iPSCs from individuals with NK cell deficiency (NKD) due to hereditary compound heterozygous GINS4 variants. We observed and characterized heterogeneous cell populations that arise during the iPSC differentiation along with NK cells. While overall cell proliferation decreased with differentiation, early NK cell precursors showed a short burst of cell proliferation. GINS4 deficiency induced replication stress in these early NK cell precursors, which are poised for apoptosis, and ultimately recapitulate the NKD phenotype.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Amino acid (AA) availability is a robust determinant of cell growth, through controlling mTORC1 activity 1. According to the predominant model in the field, AA sufficiency drives the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface by the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, from where it coordinates the majority of cellular processes (reviewed in 2,3). Importantly, however, 15 years after its initial discovery, the teleonomy of the proposed lysosomal regulation of mTORC1, and where mTORC1 acts on its effector proteins remain enigmatic 4. Here, by using multiple pharmacological and genetic means to perturb the lysosomal AA sensing and protein recycling machineries, we describe the spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and downstream functions in mammalian cells, with lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 phosphorylating distinct substrates in response to different AA sources. Moreover, we reveal that a fraction of mTOR localizes at lysosomes due to basal lysosomal proteolysis that locally supplies new AAs, even in cells grown in the presence of extracellular nutrients, whereas cytoplasmic mTORC1 is regulated by exogenous AAs. Overall, our study substantially expands our knowledge about the topology of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, and hints at the existence of distinct, Rag- and lysosome-independent mechanisms that control its activity at other subcellular locations. Given the importance of mTORC1 signalling and AA sensing for human ageing and disease 2, our findings will likely open new directions toward the identification of function-specific mTORC1 regulators, and suggest new targets for drug discovery against conditions with dysregulated mTORC1 activity in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial cristae architecture is crucial for optimal respiratory function of the organelle. Cristae shape is maintained in part by the mitochondrial inner membrane-localized MICOS complex. While MICOS is required for normal cristae morphology, the precise mechanistic role of each of the seven human MICOS subunits, and how the complex coordinates with other cristae shaping factors, has not been fully determined. Here, we examine the MICOS complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a minimal model whose genome only encodes for four core subunits. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identify a poorly characterized inner mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with MICOS and is required to maintain cristae morphology, which we name Mmc1. We demonstrate that Mmc1 works in concert with MICOS complexes to promote normal mitochondrial morphology and respiratory function. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Mmc1 is a distant relative of the Dynamin-Related Protein (DRP) family of GTPases, which are well established to shape and remodel membranes. We find that, like DRPs, Mmc1 self-associates and forms high molecular weight assemblies. Interestingly, however, Mmc1 is a pseudoenzyme that lacks key residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis, suggesting it does not dynamically remodel membranes. These data are consistent with a model in which Mmc1 stabilizes cristae architecture by acting as a scaffold to support cristae ultrastructure on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Our study reveals a new class of proteins that evolved early in fungal phylogeny and is required for the maintenance of cristae architecture. This highlights the possibility that functionally analogous proteins work with MICOS to establish cristae morphology in metazoans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded environment that influences myriad cellular processes including protein folding and metabolic reactions. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation. However, it still remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues. Here, we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties. By tracking fluorescent tracer particles, we found that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells, and rapidly increased at the onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition. This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose sensing via the cAMP-PKA pathway. PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase Ntp1, thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased. In contrast, the rapid cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, or cell volume increase. Furthermore, the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes (40-150 nm) such as ribosomes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules ([~]3 nm) such as second messengers and signaling proteins. Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking.

Significance statementCellular processes are influenced by the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as crowding and viscoelasticity. Although it has been suggested that cells tune the cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental changes, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used the dormant fission yeast spores and uncovered signaling pathways that facilitate cytoplasmic fluidization during dormancy breaking. Furthermore, we tracked the mobility of intracellular tracer particles, and found that the spore cytoplasm impedes the mobility of larger protein complexes, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules. These results suggest that small signaling proteins can diffuse relatively freely in the spore cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals, while the motion of large complexes, such as ribosomes, is restricted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rough ER sheets are a fundamental domain of the ER and the gateway into the secretory pathway. While reticulon proteins stabilize high-curvature ER tubules, it is unclear if other proteins scaffold the flat membranes of rough ER sheets. Through a proteomics screen using ER sheet localized RNA-binding proteins as bait, we identify the Sigma-1 receptor (SigmaR1) as an ER sheet shaping factor. High-resolution live cell imaging and electron tomography assign SigmaR1 as an ER sheet-localized factor whose levels determine the amount of rough ER sheets in cells. Structure-guided mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution on giant unilamellar vesicles further support a mechanism whereby SigmaR1 oligomers use their extended arrays of amphipathic helices to bind and flatten the lumenal leaflet of ER membranes. Our results demonstrate an unexpected way for proteins to sense and propagate flat membrane sheets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular senescence is a stress-induced, permanent cell cycle arrest involved in tumor suppression and aging. Senescent cells secrete bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been implicated in immune-mediated elimination of senescent cells and age-associated chronic inflammation. However, the mechanisms regulating the SASP are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the stress-responsive kinase ASK1 promotes inflammation in senescence and aging. ASK1 is activated during senescence and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activating p38, a kinase critical for the SASP. ASK1-deficient mice show impaired elimination of oncogene-induced senescent cells and an increased rate of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ASK1 deficiency prevents age-associated p38 activation and inflammation and attenuates glomerulosclerosis. Our results suggest that ASK1 is a driver of the SASP and age-associated chronic inflammation and represents a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate quantification of bacterial burden within macrophages, termed Bacterial Burden Quantification (BBQ), is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions. Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden. These automated workflows offer valuable tools for studying bacterial interactions within host cells and provide insights for various research applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized sheets of extracellular matrix that underlie epithelial and endothelial tissues. BMs regulate traffic of cells and molecules between compartments, and participate in signaling, cell migration and organogenesis. The dynamics of mammalian BMs, however, are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of models in which core BM components are endogenously labelled. Here, we describe the mTurquoise2-Col4a1 mouse, in which we fluorescently tag collagen IV, the main component of BMs. Using an innovative Planar-Sagittal live imaging technique to visualize the BM of developing skin, we directly observe BM deformation during hair follicle budding and basal progenitor cell divisions. The BMs inherent pliability enables dividing cells to remain attached to and deform the BM, rather than lose adhesion as generally thought. Using FRAP, we show BM collagen IV is extremely stable, even during periods of rapid epidermal growth. These findings demonstrate the utility of the mTurq2-Col4a1 mouse to shed new light on mammalian BM developmental dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate all traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and are among the most stable protein assemblies in cells. Intriguingly, budding yeast cells carry two variants of NPCs which differ in the presence or absence of the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39. The binding of this basket structure is the last step of NPC assembly and Mlp-positive NPCs are excluded from the region of the nuclear envelope that is associated with the nucleolus. Here, we use recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) to investigate the stability of all the NPC subcomplexes within individual NPCs. We show that the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1, Mlp2 and Pml39 remain stably associated with NPCs through multiple cell-division cycles. Mlp1/2 are responsible for the exclusion of NPCs from the nucleolar territory, but an independent pathway via Nup2 also contributes to the depletion of Mlp-negative NPCs from this region. We developed a method for single NPC tracking in budding yeast and observed that NPCs exhibit increased mobility in the absence nuclear basket components. Our data suggest that the distribution of NPCs on the nucleus is governed by the nuclear basket proteins and is the result of interactions with chromatin or chromatin-associated factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPericytes are multifunctional contractile cells that reside on capillaries. Pericytes are critical regulators of cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier function, and pericyte dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of human neurological diseases including Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pericytes (iPericytes) are a promising tool for vascular research. However, it is unclear how iPericytes functionally compare to primary human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs). We differentiated iPSCs into iPericytes of either the mesoderm or neural crest lineage using established protocols. We compared iPericyte and HBVP morphologies, quantified gene expression by qPCR and bulk RNA sequencing, and visualised pericyte protein markers by immunocytochemistry. To determine whether the gene expression of neural crest iPericytes, mesoderm iPericytes or HBVPs correlated with their functional characteristics in vitro, we quantified EdU incorporation following exposure to the key pericyte mitogen, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and, contraction and relaxation in response to the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 or vasodilator adenosine, respectively. iPericytes were morphologically similar to HBVPs and expressed canonical pericyte markers. However, iPericytes had 1864 differentially expressed genes compared to HBVPs, while there were 797 genes differentially expressed between neural crest and mesoderm iPericytes. Consistent with the ability of HBVPs to respond to PDGF-BB signalling, PDGF-BB enhanced and PDGF receptor-beta inhibitors impaired iPericyte proliferation. Administration of endothelin-1 led to iPericyte contraction and adenosine led to iPericyte relaxation, of a magnitude similar to the response evoked in HBVPs. We determined that neural crest iPericytes were less susceptible to PDGFR beta inhibition, but responded most robustly to vasoconstrictive meditators. iPericytes express pericyte-associated genes and proteins and, exhibit an appropriate physiological response upon exposure to a key endogenous mitogen or vasoactive mediators. Therefore, the generation of functional iPericytes would be suitable for use in future investigations exploring pericyte function or dysfunction in neurological diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell proliferation is a ubiquitous process required for organismal development and homeostasis. However, individuals with partial loss-of-function variants in DNA replicative helicase components often present with immunodeficiency due to specific loss of natural killer (NK) cells. Such lineage-specific disease phenotypes raise questions on how the proliferation is regulated in cell type-specific manner. We aimed to understand NK cell-specific proliferative dynamics and vulnerability to impaired helicase function using iPSCs from individuals with NK cell deficiency (NKD) due to hereditary compound heterozygous GINS4 variants. We observed and characterized heterogeneous cell populations that arise during the iPSC differentiation along with NK cells. While overall cell proliferation decreased with differentiation, early NK cell precursors showed a short burst of cell proliferation. GINS4 deficiency induced replication stress in these early NK cell precursors, which are poised for apoptosis, and ultimately recapitulate the NKD phenotype.</p>
