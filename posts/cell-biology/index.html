A. M.; Ford, M.; Sosnick, T. R.; Drummond, D. A.\nScore: 42.9, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551061\nCells must sense and respond to sudden maladaptive environmental changes--stresses--to survive and thrive. Across eukaryotes, stresses such as heat shock trigger conserved responses: growth arrest, a specific transcriptional response, and biomolecular condensation of protein and mRNA into structures known as stress granules under severe stress. The composition, formation mechanism, adaptive significance, and even evolutionary conservation of these condensed structures remain enigmatic. Here we provide an unprecedented view into stress-triggered condensation, its evolutionary conservation and tuning, and its integration into other well-studied aspects of the stress response. Using three morphologically near-identical budding yeast species adapted to different thermal environments and diverged by up to 100 million years, we show that proteome-scale biomolecular condensation is tuned to species-specific thermal niches, closely tracking corresponding growth and transcriptional responses. In each species, poly(A)-binding protein--a core marker of stress granules--condenses in isolation at species-specific temperatures, with conserved molecular features and conformational changes modulating condensation. From the ecological to the molecular scale, our results reveal previously unappreciated levels of evolutionary selection in the eukaryotic stress response, while establishing a rich, tractable system for further inquiry.\nNanoscale analysis of human G1 and metaphase chromatin in situ\nAuthors: Chen, J. K.; Liu, T.; Cai, S.; Ruan, W.; Ng, C. T.; Shi, J.; Surana, U.; Gan, L.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551204\nThe structure of chromatin at the nucleosome level inside cells is mysterious. Here we present in situ cryo-ET analyses of chromatin in both G1 and metaphase RPE-1 cells. G1 nucleosomes are concentrated in globular chromatin domains and metaphase nucleosomes are concentrated in the chromatids. Classification analysis reveals that canonical mononucleosomes, ordered stacked dinucleosomes, and mononucleosomes with a disordered gyre-proximal density are abundant in both cell-cycle states. Class averages that have more than two stacked nucleosomes or that have side-by-side dinucleosomes are not detected, suggesting that groups of more than two nucleosomes are heterogeneous. Large multi-megadalton structures are abundant in G1 nucleoplasm, but not found in G1 chromatin domains and metaphase chromatin. The macromolecular phenotypes studied here represent a starting point for the comparative analysis of condensation in normal and unhealthy human cells, in other cell-cycle states, other organisms, and in vitro chromatin assemblies.\nLactate activates the mitochondrial electron transport chain independent of its metabolism\nAuthors: Cai, X.; Ng, C. C.; Jones, O.; Fung, T. S.; Ryu, K.; Li, D.; Thompson, C. B.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551712\nLactate has long been considered a cellular waste product. However, we found that as extracellular lactate accumulates, it also enters the mitochondrial matrix and stimulates mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. The resulting increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis suppresses glycolysis and increases the utilization of pyruvate and/or alternative respiratory substrates. The ability of lactate to increase oxidative phosphorylation does not depend on its metabolism. Both L- and D-lactate are effective at enhancing ETC activity and suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the selective induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by unmetabolized D-lactate reversibly suppressed aerobic glycolysis in both cancer cell lines and proliferating primary cells in an ATP-dependent manner and enabled cell growth on respiratory-dependent bioenergetic substrates. In primary T cells, D-lactate enhanced cell proliferation and effector function. Together, these findings demonstrate that lactate is a critical regulator of the ability of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to suppress glucose fermentation.\nTargeted Photoconvertible BODIPYs Based on Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion for Applications in Photoconversion and Live Super Resolution Imaging\nAuthors: Saladin, L.; Breton, V.; Lequeu, T.; Didier, P.; Danglot, L.; Collot, M.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550940\nPhotomodulable fluorescent probes are drawing an increasing attention due to their applications in advanced bioimaging. Whereas photoconvertible probes can be advantageously used in tracking, photoswitchable probes constitute key tools for single molecule localization microscopy to perform super resolution imaging. Herein we shed light on a red and far-red BODIPY, namely BDP-576 and BDP-650 possessing both properties of conversion and switching. Our study demonstrates that theses pyrrolyl-BODIPYs respectively convert towards typical green- and red-emitting BODIPYs that are perfectly adapted to microscopy. We also showed that these pyrrolyl-BODIPYs undergo Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion, a photoconversion mechanism that we recently introduced and where the pyrrole moiety plays a central role. These unique features were used to develop targeted photoconvertible probes towards different organelles or subcellular units (plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, actin, Golgi apparatus, etc.) using chemical targeting moieties and Halo tag. We notably showed that BDP-650 could be used to track intracellular vesicles over more than 20 minutes in two color imaging with laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating its robustness. The switching properties of these photoconverters were studied at the single molecule level and were then successfully used in live Single Molecule Localization Microscopy in epithelial cells and neurons. Both membrane and mitochondria targeted probes could be used to decipher membrane 3D architecture and mitochondria dynamics at the nanoscale. This study builds a bridge between the photoconversion and photoswitching properties of probes undergoing directed photooxidation and shows the versatility and efficacy of this mechanism in live advanced imaging.\nRho-associated kinase regulates Langerhans cell morphology and responsiveness to tissue damage\nAuthors: Peterman, E.; Quitevis, E. J. A.; Goo, C. E. A.; Rasmussen, J. P.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550974\nSkin is often the first physical barrier to encounter invading pathogens and physical damage. Damage to the skin must be resolved quickly and efficiently to maintain organ homeostasis. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to dynamically surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains epithelial keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are not well understood. Using skin explants from adult zebrafish, we show that Langerhans cells maintain normal surveillance activity following axonal degeneration and use their dynamic dendrites to engulf small axonal debris. By contrast, a ramified-to-rounded shape transition accommodates the engulfment of larger keratinocyte debris. We find that Langerhans cell dendrites are richly populated with actin and sensitive to a broad spectrum actin inhibitor. We further show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition leads to elongated dendrites, perturbed clearance of large debris, and reduced Langerhans cell migration to tissue-scale wounds. Altogether, our work describes the unique dynamics of Langerhans cells and involvement of the ROCK pathway in immune cell responses to damage of varying magnitude.\nA force-sensitive mutation reveals a spindle assembly checkpoint-independent role for dynein in anaphase progression\nAuthors: Salvador-Garcia, D.; Jin, L.; Hensley, A.; Golcuk, M.; Gallaud, E.; Chaaban, S.; Port, F.; Vagnoni, A.; Planelles-Herrero, V. J.; McClintock, M. A.; Derivery, E.; Carter, A. P.; Giet, R.; Gur, M.; Yildiz, A.; Bullock, S. L.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551815\nThe cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) motor organizes cells by shaping microtubule networks and moving a large variety of cargoes along them. However, dynein's diverse roles complicate in vivo studies of its functions significantly. To address this issue, we have used gene editing to generate a series of missense mutations in Drosophila Dynein heavy chain (Dhc). We find that mutations associated with human neurological disease cause a range of defects in larval and adult flies, including impaired cargo trafficking in neurons. We also describe a novel mutation in the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of Dhc that, remarkably, causes metaphase arrest of mitotic spindles in the embryo but does not impair other dynein-dependent processes. We demonstrate that the mitotic arrest is independent of dynein's well-established roles in silencing the spindle assembly checkpoint. In vitro reconstitution and optical trapping assays reveal that the mutation only impairs the performance of dynein under load. In silico all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that this effect correlates with increased flexibility of the MTBD, as well as an altered orientation of the stalk domain, with respect to the microtubule. Collectively, our data point to a novel role of dynein in anaphase progression that depends on the motor operating in a specific load regime. More broadly, our work illustrates how cytoskeletal transport processes can be dissected in vivo by manipulating mechanical properties of motors.\nDisordered C-terminal domain drives spatiotemporal confinement of RNAPII to enhance search for chromatin targets\nAuthors: Ling, Y. H.; Ye, J.; Yu, C.; Liang, C.; Park, G.; Corden, J.; Wu, C.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551302\nEfficient gene expression demands RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to find chromatin targets precisely in space and time. How RNAPII manages this complex diffusive search in a 3D nuclear space remains largely unknown. The disordered carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, which is essential for recruiting transcription-associated proteins, forms phase-separated droplets in vitro, hinting at a potential role in modulating RNAPII dynamics. Here, we use single-molecule tracking and spatiotemporal mapping in living yeast to show that the CTD is responsible for confining RNAPII diffusion within a subnuclear region enriched for active genes, but without apparent phase separation into condensates. Both Mediator and global chromatin organization are required for sustaining RNAPII confinement. Remarkably, truncating the CTD disrupts RNAPII spatial confinement, prolongs target search, diminishes chromatin binding, impairs pre-initiation complex formation, and reduces transcription bursting. This study illuminates the pivotal role of the CTD in driving spatiotemporal confinement of RNAPII for efficient gene expression.\nLysosomal release of amino acids at ER three-way junctions regulates transmembrane and secretory protein mRNA translation\nAuthors: Choi, H.; Liao, Y.-C.; Yoon, Y. J.; Grimm, J. B.; Lavis, L.; Singer, R. H.; Lippincott-Schwartz, J.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551382\nOne-third of the mammalian proteome is comprised of transmembrane and secretory proteins that are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we investigate the spatial distribution and regulation of mRNAs encoding these membrane and secretory proteins (termed \"secretome\" mRNAs) through live cell, single molecule tracking to directly monitor the position and translation states of secretome mRNAs on ER and their relationship to other organelles. Notably, translation of secretome mRNAs occurred preferentially near lysosomes on ER marked by the ER junction-associated protein, Lunapark. Knockdown of Lunapark reduced the extent of secretome mRNA translation without affecting translation of other mRNAs. Less secretome mRNA translation also occurred when lysosome function was perturbed by raising lysosomal pH or inhibiting lysosomal proteases. Secretome mRNA translation near lysosomes was enhanced during amino acid deprivation. Addition of the integrated stress response inhibitor, ISRIB, reversed the translation inhibition seen in Lunapark knockdown cells, implying an eIF2 dependency. Altogether, these findings uncover a novel coordination between ER and lysosomes, in which local release of amino acids and other factors from ER-associated lysosomes patterns and regulates translation of mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins.\nLong-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A activates the mitochondrial fission factors MiD49 and MiD51 by inducing their oligomerization\nAuthors: Liu, A.; Kage, F.; Sapp, G.; Aydin, H.; Higgs, H. N.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551267\nMitochondrial fission occurs in many cellular processes, but the regulation of fission is poorly understood. We show that long-chain acyl coenzyme A (LCACA) activates two related mitochondrial fission proteins, MiD49 and MiD51, by inducing their oligomerization, activating their ability to stimulate DRP1 GTPase activity. The 1:1 stoichiometry of LCACA:MiD in the oligomer suggests interaction in the previously identified nucleotide-binding pocket, and a point mutation in this pocket reduces LCACA binding and LCACA-induced oligomerization for MiD51. In cells, this LCACA binding mutant does not assemble into puncta on mitochondria or rescue MiD49/51 knock-down effects on mitochondrial length and DRP1 recruitment. Furthermore, cellular treatment with the fatty acid analogue 2-bromopalmitate, which causes increased acyl-CoA, promotes mitochondrial fission in an MiD49/51-dependent manner. These results suggest that LCACA is an endogenous ligand for MiDs, inducing mitochondrial fission and providing a potential mechanism for fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Finally, MiD49 or MiD51 oligomers synergize with MFF, but not with actin filaments, in DRP1 activation, suggesting distinct pathways for DRP1 activation.\nSulfolobus acidocaldarius adhesion pili power twitching motility in the absence of a dedicated retraction ATPase\nAuthors: Charles-Orszag, A.; van Wolferen, M.; Lord, S. J.; Albers, S.-V.; Mullins, D.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552066\nType IV pili are ancient and widespread filamentous organelles found in most bacterial and archaeal phyla where they support a wide range of functions, including substrate adhesion, DNA uptake, self aggregation, and cell motility. In most bacteria, PilT-family ATPases disassemble adhesion pili, causing them to rapidly retract and produce twitching motility, important for surface colonization. As archaea do not possess homologs of PilT, it was thought that archaeal pili cannot retract. Here, we employ live-cell imaging under native conditions (75{degrees}C and pH 2), together with automated single-cell tracking, high-temperature fluorescence imaging, and genetic manipulation to demonstrate that S. acidocaldarius exhibits bona fide twitching motility, and that this behavior depends specifically on retractable adhesion pili. Our results demonstrate that archaeal adhesion pili are capable of retraction in the absence of a PilT retraction ATPase and suggests that the ancestral type IV pilus machinery in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) relied on such a bifunctional ATPase for both extension and retraction.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cells must sense and respond to sudden maladaptive environmental changes--stresses--to survive and thrive. Across eukaryotes, stresses such as heat shock trigger conserved responses: growth arrest, a specific transcriptional response, and biomolecular condensation of protein and mRNA into structures known as stress granules under severe stress. The composition, formation mechanism, adaptive significance, and even evolutionary conservation of these condensed structures remain enigmatic. Here we provide an unprecedented view into stress-triggered condensation, its evolutionary conservation and tuning, and its integration into other well-studied aspects of the stress response. Using three morphologically near-identical budding yeast species adapted to different thermal environments and diverged by up to 100 million years, we show that proteome-scale biomolecular condensation is tuned to species-specific thermal niches, closely tracking corresponding growth and transcriptional responses. In each species, poly(A)-binding protein--a core marker of stress granules--condenses in isolation at species-specific temperatures, with conserved molecular features and conformational changes modulating condensation. From the ecological to the molecular scale, our results reveal previously unappreciated levels of evolutionary selection in the eukaryotic stress response, while establishing a rich, tractable system for further inquiry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of chromatin at the nucleosome level inside cells is mysterious. Here we present in situ cryo-ET analyses of chromatin in both G1 and metaphase RPE-1 cells. G1 nucleosomes are concentrated in globular chromatin domains and metaphase nucleosomes are concentrated in the chromatids. Classification analysis reveals that canonical mononucleosomes, ordered stacked dinucleosomes, and mononucleosomes with a disordered gyre-proximal density are abundant in both cell-cycle states. Class averages that have more than two stacked nucleosomes or that have side-by-side dinucleosomes are not detected, suggesting that groups of more than two nucleosomes are heterogeneous. Large multi-megadalton structures are abundant in G1 nucleoplasm, but not found in G1 chromatin domains and metaphase chromatin. The macromolecular phenotypes studied here represent a starting point for the comparative analysis of condensation in normal and unhealthy human cells, in other cell-cycle states, other organisms, and in vitro chromatin assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lactate has long been considered a cellular waste product. However, we found that as extracellular lactate accumulates, it also enters the mitochondrial matrix and stimulates mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. The resulting increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis suppresses glycolysis and increases the utilization of pyruvate and/or alternative respiratory substrates. The ability of lactate to increase oxidative phosphorylation does not depend on its metabolism. Both L- and D-lactate are effective at enhancing ETC activity and suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the selective induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by unmetabolized D-lactate reversibly suppressed aerobic glycolysis in both cancer cell lines and proliferating primary cells in an ATP-dependent manner and enabled cell growth on respiratory-dependent bioenergetic substrates. In primary T cells, D-lactate enhanced cell proliferation and effector function. Together, these findings demonstrate that lactate is a critical regulator of the ability of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to suppress glucose fermentation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Photomodulable fluorescent probes are drawing an increasing attention due to their applications in advanced bioimaging. Whereas photoconvertible probes can be advantageously used in tracking, photoswitchable probes constitute key tools for single molecule localization microscopy to perform super resolution imaging. Herein we shed light on a red and far-red BODIPY, namely BDP-576 and BDP-650 possessing both properties of conversion and switching. Our study demonstrates that theses pyrrolyl-BODIPYs respectively convert towards typical green- and red-emitting BODIPYs that are perfectly adapted to microscopy. We also showed that these pyrrolyl-BODIPYs undergo Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion, a photoconversion mechanism that we recently introduced and where the pyrrole moiety plays a central role. These unique features were used to develop targeted photoconvertible probes towards different organelles or subcellular units (plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, actin, Golgi apparatus, etc.) using chemical targeting moieties and Halo tag. We notably showed that BDP-650 could be used to track intracellular vesicles over more than 20 minutes in two color imaging with laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating its robustness. The switching properties of these photoconverters were studied at the single molecule level and were then successfully used in live Single Molecule Localization Microscopy in epithelial cells and neurons. Both membrane and mitochondria targeted probes could be used to decipher membrane 3D architecture and mitochondria dynamics at the nanoscale. This study builds a bridge between the photoconversion and photoswitching properties of probes undergoing directed photooxidation and shows the versatility and efficacy of this mechanism in live advanced imaging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skin is often the first physical barrier to encounter invading pathogens and physical damage. Damage to the skin must be resolved quickly and efficiently to maintain organ homeostasis. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to dynamically surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains epithelial keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are not well understood. Using skin explants from adult zebrafish, we show that Langerhans cells maintain normal surveillance activity following axonal degeneration and use their dynamic dendrites to engulf small axonal debris. By contrast, a ramified-to-rounded shape transition accommodates the engulfment of larger keratinocyte debris. We find that Langerhans cell dendrites are richly populated with actin and sensitive to a broad spectrum actin inhibitor. We further show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition leads to elongated dendrites, perturbed clearance of large debris, and reduced Langerhans cell migration to tissue-scale wounds. Altogether, our work describes the unique dynamics of Langerhans cells and involvement of the ROCK pathway in immune cell responses to damage of varying magnitude.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) motor organizes cells by shaping microtubule networks and moving a large variety of cargoes along them. However, dynein&#39;s diverse roles complicate in vivo studies of its functions significantly. To address this issue, we have used gene editing to generate a series of missense mutations in Drosophila Dynein heavy chain (Dhc). We find that mutations associated with human neurological disease cause a range of defects in larval and adult flies, including impaired cargo trafficking in neurons. We also describe a novel mutation in the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of Dhc that, remarkably, causes metaphase arrest of mitotic spindles in the embryo but does not impair other dynein-dependent processes. We demonstrate that the mitotic arrest is independent of dynein&#39;s well-established roles in silencing the spindle assembly checkpoint. In vitro reconstitution and optical trapping assays reveal that the mutation only impairs the performance of dynein under load. In silico all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that this effect correlates with increased flexibility of the MTBD, as well as an altered orientation of the stalk domain, with respect to the microtubule. Collectively, our data point to a novel role of dynein in anaphase progression that depends on the motor operating in a specific load regime. More broadly, our work illustrates how cytoskeletal transport processes can be dissected in vivo by manipulating mechanical properties of motors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Efficient gene expression demands RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to find chromatin targets precisely in space and time. How RNAPII manages this complex diffusive search in a 3D nuclear space remains largely unknown. The disordered carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, which is essential for recruiting transcription-associated proteins, forms phase-separated droplets in vitro, hinting at a potential role in modulating RNAPII dynamics. Here, we use single-molecule tracking and spatiotemporal mapping in living yeast to show that the CTD is responsible for confining RNAPII diffusion within a subnuclear region enriched for active genes, but without apparent phase separation into condensates. Both Mediator and global chromatin organization are required for sustaining RNAPII confinement. Remarkably, truncating the CTD disrupts RNAPII spatial confinement, prolongs target search, diminishes chromatin binding, impairs pre-initiation complex formation, and reduces transcription bursting. This study illuminates the pivotal role of the CTD in driving spatiotemporal confinement of RNAPII for efficient gene expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One-third of the mammalian proteome is comprised of transmembrane and secretory proteins that are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we investigate the spatial distribution and regulation of mRNAs encoding these membrane and secretory proteins (termed &#34;secretome&#34; mRNAs) through live cell, single molecule tracking to directly monitor the position and translation states of secretome mRNAs on ER and their relationship to other organelles. Notably, translation of secretome mRNAs occurred preferentially near lysosomes on ER marked by the ER junction-associated protein, Lunapark. Knockdown of Lunapark reduced the extent of secretome mRNA translation without affecting translation of other mRNAs. Less secretome mRNA translation also occurred when lysosome function was perturbed by raising lysosomal pH or inhibiting lysosomal proteases. Secretome mRNA translation near lysosomes was enhanced during amino acid deprivation. Addition of the integrated stress response inhibitor, ISRIB, reversed the translation inhibition seen in Lunapark knockdown cells, implying an eIF2 dependency. Altogether, these findings uncover a novel coordination between ER and lysosomes, in which local release of amino acids and other factors from ER-associated lysosomes patterns and regulates translation of mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial fission occurs in many cellular processes, but the regulation of fission is poorly understood. We show that long-chain acyl coenzyme A (LCACA) activates two related mitochondrial fission proteins, MiD49 and MiD51, by inducing their oligomerization, activating their ability to stimulate DRP1 GTPase activity. The 1:1 stoichiometry of LCACA:MiD in the oligomer suggests interaction in the previously identified nucleotide-binding pocket, and a point mutation in this pocket reduces LCACA binding and LCACA-induced oligomerization for MiD51. In cells, this LCACA binding mutant does not assemble into puncta on mitochondria or rescue MiD49/51 knock-down effects on mitochondrial length and DRP1 recruitment. Furthermore, cellular treatment with the fatty acid analogue 2-bromopalmitate, which causes increased acyl-CoA, promotes mitochondrial fission in an MiD49/51-dependent manner. These results suggest that LCACA is an endogenous ligand for MiDs, inducing mitochondrial fission and providing a potential mechanism for fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Finally, MiD49 or MiD51 oligomers synergize with MFF, but not with actin filaments, in DRP1 activation, suggesting distinct pathways for DRP1 activation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type IV pili are ancient and widespread filamentous organelles found in most bacterial and archaeal phyla where they support a wide range of functions, including substrate adhesion, DNA uptake, self aggregation, and cell motility. In most bacteria, PilT-family ATPases disassemble adhesion pili, causing them to rapidly retract and produce twitching motility, important for surface colonization. As archaea do not possess homologs of PilT, it was thought that archaeal pili cannot retract. Here, we employ live-cell imaging under native conditions (75{degrees}C and pH 2), together with automated single-cell tracking, high-temperature fluorescence imaging, and genetic manipulation to demonstrate that S. acidocaldarius exhibits bona fide twitching motility, and that this behavior depends specifically on retractable adhesion pili. Our results demonstrate that archaeal adhesion pili are capable of retraction in the absence of a PilT retraction ATPase and suggests that the ancestral type IV pilus machinery in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) relied on such a bifunctional ATPase for both extension and retraction.</p>
