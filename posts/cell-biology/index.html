F.; Valon, L.; Roca-Cusachs, P.; Alert, R.; Trepat, X.\nScore: 50.5, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576733\nThe front of migratory cellular clusters during development, wound healing and cancer invasion is typically populated with highly protrusive cells that are called leader cells. Leader cells are thought to physically pull and direct their cohort of followers, but how leaders and followers are mechanically organized to migrate collectively remains controversial. One possibility is that the autonomous local action of a leader cell is sufficient to drive migration of the group. Yet another possibility is that a global mechanical organization is required for the group to move cohesively. Here we show that the effectiveness of leader-follower organization is proportional to the asymmetry of traction and tension within the cellular cluster. By combining hydrogel micropatterning and optogenetic activation of Rac1, we locally generate highly protrusive leaders at the edge of minimal cell groups. We find that the induced leader can robustly drag one follower but is generally unable to direct larger groups. By measuring traction forces and tension propagation in groups of increasing size, we establish a quantitative relationship between group velocity and the asymmetry of the traction and tension profiles. We propose a model of the motile cluster as an active polar fluid that explains this force-velocity relationship in terms of asymmetries in the distribution of active tractions. Our results challenge the notion of autonomous leader cells by showing that collective cell migration requires a global mechanical organization within the cluster.\nSpatial proteomics of ER tubules reveals CLMN, an ER-actin tether at focal adhesions that promotes cell migration\nAuthors: Merta, H.; Isogai, T.; Paul, B.; Danuser, G.; Henne, W. M.\nScore: 34.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577043\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is structurally and functionally diverse, yet how its functions are organized within morphological subdomains is incompletely understood. Utilizing TurboID-based proximity labeling and CRISPR knock-in technologies, here we map the proteomic landscape of the human ER and nuclear envelope. Spatial proteomics reveals enrichments of proteins into ER tubules, sheets, and nuclear envelope. We uncover an ER-enriched actin-binding protein, Calmin (CLMN), and define it as an ER-actin tether that localizes to focal adhesions adjacent to ER tubules. CLMN depletion perturbs focal adhesion disassembly, actin dynamics, and cell movement. Mechanistically, CLMN-depleted cells also exhibit defects in calcium signaling near ER-actin interfaces, suggesting CLMN promotes calcium signaling near adhesions to facilitate their disassembly. Collectively, we map the sub-organelle proteome landscape of the ER, identify CLMN as an ER-actin tether, and describe a non-canonical mechanism by which ER tubules engage actin to regulate cell migration.\nFull-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress-granule dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress\nAuthors: Dar, S. A.; Malla, S.; Martinek, V.; Payea, M. J.; Lee, C. T.-Y.; Martin, J.; Khandeshi, A. J.; Martindale, J. L.; Belair, C.; Maragkakis, M.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555629\nCells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5 end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5 end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on removal of the poly(A) tail. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 fully rescues RNA length and suppresses stress-induced decay. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.\nParaoxonase-like APMAP maintains endoplasmic reticulum-associated lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis\nAuthors: Paul, B.; Merta, H.; Ugrankar-Banerjee, R.; Hensley, M.; Tran, S.; Dias do Vale, G.; McDonald, J. G.; Farber, S. A.; Henne, W. M.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577049\nOxidative stress perturbs lipid homeostasis and contributes to metabolic diseases. Though ignored compared to mitochondrial oxidation, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) generates reactive oxygen species requiring antioxidant quality control. Using multi-organismal profiling featuring Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells, here we characterize the paraoxonase-like APMAP as an ER-localized protein that promotes redox and lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein maturation. APMAP-depleted mammalian cells exhibit defective ER morphology, elevated ER and oxidative stress, lipid droplet accumulation, and perturbed ApoB-lipoprotein homeostasis. Critically, APMAP loss is rescued with chemical antioxidant NAC. Organismal APMAP depletion in Drosophila perturbs fat and lipoprotein homeostasis, and zebrafish display increased vascular ApoB-containing lipoproteins, particles that are atherogenic in mammals. Lipidomics reveals altered polyunsaturated phospholipids and increased ceramides upon APMAP loss, which perturbs ApoB-lipoprotein maturation. These ApoB-associated defects are rescued by inhibiting ceramide synthesis. Collectively, we propose APMAP is an ER-localized antioxidant that promotes lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis.\nAn iPSC-derived small intestine-on-chip with self-organizing epithelial, mesenchymal and neural cells\nAuthors: Moerkens, R.; Mooiweer, J.; Ramirez-Sanchez, A. D.; Oelen, R.; Franke, L.; Wijmenga, C.; Barrett, R. J.; Jonkers, I. H.; Withoff, S.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574203\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal organoids are valuable tools for researching developmental biology and personalized therapies, but their closed topology and relative immature state limits their applications. Here we use organ-on-chip technology to develop a hiPSC-derived intestinal barrier with apical and basolateral access in a more physiological in vitro microenvironment. To replicate growth factor gradients along the crypt- villus axis, we locally exposed the cells to expansion and differentiation media. In these conditions, intestinal epithelial cells self-organize into villus-like folds with physiological barrier integrity and myofibroblast and neural subtypes emerge and form a layer in the bottom channel underneath the epithelial tissue. The growth factor gradients efficiently balance dividing and mature cell types and induce an intestinal epithelial composition, including absorptive and secretory lineages, resembling the composition of the human adult small intestine. The result is a well-characterized hiPSC-derived intestine-on-chip system that can facilitate personalized studies on physiological processes and therapy development in the human small intestine.\nIntra-condensate demixing of TDP-43 inside stress granules generates pathological aggregates\nAuthors: Yan, X.; Kuster, D.; Mohanty, P.; Nijssen, J.; Pombo-Garcia, K.; Rizuan, A.; Franzmann, T. M.; Sergeeva, A.; dos Passos, P. M.; George, L.; Wang, S.-H.; Shenoy, J.; Danielson, H. L.; Honigmann, A.; Ayala, Y. M.; Fawzi, N. L.; Mittal, J.; Alberti, S.; Hyman, A. A.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576837\nCytosolic aggregation of the nuclear protein TDP-43 is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, but the triggers for TDP-43 aggregation are still debated. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43 enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transitions into pathological aggregates. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells. We conclude that up-concentration inside condensates and simultaneous exposure to environmental stress could be a general pathway for protein aggregation, with intra-condensate demixing constituting a key intermediate step.\nTDP43 aggregation at ER-exit sites impairs ER-to-Golgi transport\nAuthors: Wu, H.; Wang, L. C.; Sow, B.; Leow, D.; Zhu, J.; Gallo, K.; Wilsbach, K.; Gupta, R.; Ostrow, L.; Yeo, C.; Sobota, R.; Li, R.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576891\nProtein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employed a general reporter to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. Over 300 proteins were identified, forming different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown solid inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES coaggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delayed ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.\nExtracellular matrix signals promotes actin-dependent mitochondrial elongation and activity\nAuthors: Gatti, P.; Mukherjee, P.; Talukdar, P. D.; Freppel, W.; Kanou, J.; Chatel-Chaix, L.; Chatterji, U.; Germain, M.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576703\nMitochondria are crucial metabolic organelles that are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular cues. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key component of the cellular environment that controls cellular behavior and metabolic activity. Here, we determined how ECM signalling regulates mitochondrial structure and activity. To distinguish mitochondrial regulation from the general survival cues generated by the ECM, we used breast cancer-derived spheres (mammospheres) because of their ability to grow in suspension culture in the absence of ECM. Using this system, we demonstrate that the association of mammospheres with the ECM results in dramatic mitochondrial elongation, along with enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. This remodeling occurs independently of DRP1 activity, but relies on integrin signaling and actin polymerization. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ECM-driven actin polymerization plays a crucial role in remodeling mitochondrial networks to promote OXPHOS, which represents a vital step for migrating cells to enhance cellular adhesion and facilitate cell growth.\nAcyltransferases in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis have redundant and non-redundant roles in sn-1 acyl chain regulation, ether lipid levels, and cell survival\nAuthors: Salame, S.; Qasmaoui, H.; Jose, G. P.; Fleuriot, L.; Debayle, D.; Harayama, T.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576130\nThe increased use of lipidomics analyses in biomedical research made it crucial to understand correctly how lipid compositions are regulated. Lipid acyl chains are important regulators of membrane physicochemical properties, and are incorporated by various acyltransferases. The acyltransferases implicated in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis, the GPATs and GNPAT, have distinct localizations and substrate preferences. This suggests that they have distinct roles on lipid regulation, but a complete understanding of their redundant and non-redundant functions is missing. We report here a comprehensive analysis of cells having mutations in GPATs and GNPAT, either alone or in combinations. Our results suggest that the balance between GPATs and GNPAT affect the levels of ether lipids, together with glycerophospholipid acyl chain length and unsaturation. In addition, we found that lipid synthesis initiated at peroxisomes, but not mitochondria, is sufficient to provide the lipid synthesis flux required for normal cell growth. Our study unveils the multifaceted roles of the first step of de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis, thus leading to a better understanding of how lipidomes are shaped.\nAn evolutionary-conserved VPS34-PIKfyve-TRPML1-Myosin II axis regulates the speed of amoeboid cell migration\nAuthors: Dehio, P.; Michard, C.; Yam-Puc, J. C.; Marti i Lindez, A.-A.; Fabre, L.; Schaefer, T.; Wymann, M. P.; Okkenhaug, K.; Soldati, T.; Mehling, M.; Hess, C.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.575998\nAmoeboid cell migration is key to efficient T cell immunity. Spatial polarization of organelles within cells, including endo-lysosomes, is a prerequisite of migration. However, how ultrastructural polarization is linked to the signaling requirements governing T cell migration, remains unknown. Here we show that signaling molecules generated by endo-lysosome-localized kinases regulate velocity of amoeboid migration. Specifically, imaging of T cells identified accumulation of endo-lysosomes decorated with the lipid kinases VPS34-PIKfyve at the uropod of polarized cells. Activity of VPS34 and PIKfyve regulated speed, but not directedness, of migrating T cells. Mechanistically, PI(3,5)P2 generated by the sequential action of VPS34 and PIKfyve mediated Ca2+ efflux from lysosomes via the mucolipin TRP cation channel 1 (TRPML1), thus controlling activity of myosin IIA and hence the generation of propulsive force through retrograde actin flow. The VPS34-PIKfyve kinases also regulated velocity of myeloid cells, as well as of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum - establishing the axis as an evolutionary conserved speed control system of amoeboid cell migration. Graphical AbstractO_LIThe VPS34-PIKfyve axis is active on endo-lysosomes at the uropod of migrating T cells. C_LIO_LIVPS34 and PIKfyve promote myosin IIA activation and retrograde action flow.

        <p class="abstract">The front of migratory cellular clusters during development, wound healing and cancer invasion is typically populated with highly protrusive cells that are called leader cells. Leader cells are thought to physically pull and direct their cohort of followers, but how leaders and followers are mechanically organized to migrate collectively remains controversial. One possibility is that the autonomous local action of a leader cell is sufficient to drive migration of the group. Yet another possibility is that a global mechanical organization is required for the group to move cohesively. Here we show that the effectiveness of leader-follower organization is proportional to the asymmetry of traction and tension within the cellular cluster. By combining hydrogel micropatterning and optogenetic activation of Rac1, we locally generate highly protrusive leaders at the edge of minimal cell groups. We find that the induced leader can robustly drag one follower but is generally unable to direct larger groups. By measuring traction forces and tension propagation in groups of increasing size, we establish a quantitative relationship between group velocity and the asymmetry of the traction and tension profiles. We propose a model of the motile cluster as an active polar fluid that explains this force-velocity relationship in terms of asymmetries in the distribution of active tractions. Our results challenge the notion of autonomous leader cells by showing that collective cell migration requires a global mechanical organization within the cluster.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is structurally and functionally diverse, yet how its functions are organized within morphological subdomains is incompletely understood. Utilizing TurboID-based proximity labeling and CRISPR knock-in technologies, here we map the proteomic landscape of the human ER and nuclear envelope. Spatial proteomics reveals enrichments of proteins into ER tubules, sheets, and nuclear envelope. We uncover an ER-enriched actin-binding protein, Calmin (CLMN), and define it as an ER-actin tether that localizes to focal adhesions adjacent to ER tubules. CLMN depletion perturbs focal adhesion disassembly, actin dynamics, and cell movement. Mechanistically, CLMN-depleted cells also exhibit defects in calcium signaling near ER-actin interfaces, suggesting CLMN promotes calcium signaling near adhesions to facilitate their disassembly. Collectively, we map the sub-organelle proteome landscape of the ER, identify CLMN as an ER-actin tether, and describe a non-canonical mechanism by which ER tubules engage actin to regulate cell migration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5 end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5 end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on removal of the poly(A) tail. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 fully rescues RNA length and suppresses stress-induced decay. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Oxidative stress perturbs lipid homeostasis and contributes to metabolic diseases. Though ignored compared to mitochondrial oxidation, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) generates reactive oxygen species requiring antioxidant quality control. Using multi-organismal profiling featuring Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells, here we characterize the paraoxonase-like APMAP as an ER-localized protein that promotes redox and lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein maturation. APMAP-depleted mammalian cells exhibit defective ER morphology, elevated ER and oxidative stress, lipid droplet accumulation, and perturbed ApoB-lipoprotein homeostasis. Critically, APMAP loss is rescued with chemical antioxidant NAC. Organismal APMAP depletion in Drosophila perturbs fat and lipoprotein homeostasis, and zebrafish display increased vascular ApoB-containing lipoproteins, particles that are atherogenic in mammals. Lipidomics reveals altered polyunsaturated phospholipids and increased ceramides upon APMAP loss, which perturbs ApoB-lipoprotein maturation. These ApoB-associated defects are rescued by inhibiting ceramide synthesis. Collectively, we propose APMAP is an ER-localized antioxidant that promotes lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal organoids are valuable tools for researching developmental biology and personalized therapies, but their closed topology and relative immature state limits their applications. Here we use organ-on-chip technology to develop a hiPSC-derived intestinal barrier with apical and basolateral access in a more physiological in vitro microenvironment. To replicate growth factor gradients along the crypt- villus axis, we locally exposed the cells to expansion and differentiation media. In these conditions, intestinal epithelial cells self-organize into villus-like folds with physiological barrier integrity and myofibroblast and neural subtypes emerge and form a layer in the bottom channel underneath the epithelial tissue. The growth factor gradients efficiently balance dividing and mature cell types and induce an intestinal epithelial composition, including absorptive and secretory lineages, resembling the composition of the human adult small intestine. The result is a well-characterized hiPSC-derived intestine-on-chip system that can facilitate personalized studies on physiological processes and therapy development in the human small intestine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytosolic aggregation of the nuclear protein TDP-43 is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, but the triggers for TDP-43 aggregation are still debated. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43 enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transitions into pathological aggregates. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells. We conclude that up-concentration inside condensates and simultaneous exposure to environmental stress could be a general pathway for protein aggregation, with intra-condensate demixing constituting a key intermediate step.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employed a general reporter to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. Over 300 proteins were identified, forming different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown solid inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES coaggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delayed ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria are crucial metabolic organelles that are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular cues. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key component of the cellular environment that controls cellular behavior and metabolic activity. Here, we determined how ECM signalling regulates mitochondrial structure and activity. To distinguish mitochondrial regulation from the general survival cues generated by the ECM, we used breast cancer-derived spheres (mammospheres) because of their ability to grow in suspension culture in the absence of ECM. Using this system, we demonstrate that the association of mammospheres with the ECM results in dramatic mitochondrial elongation, along with enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. This remodeling occurs independently of DRP1 activity, but relies on integrin signaling and actin polymerization. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ECM-driven actin polymerization plays a crucial role in remodeling mitochondrial networks to promote OXPHOS, which represents a vital step for migrating cells to enhance cellular adhesion and facilitate cell growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increased use of lipidomics analyses in biomedical research made it crucial to understand correctly how lipid compositions are regulated. Lipid acyl chains are important regulators of membrane physicochemical properties, and are incorporated by various acyltransferases. The acyltransferases implicated in the first step of glycerophospholipid synthesis, the GPATs and GNPAT, have distinct localizations and substrate preferences. This suggests that they have distinct roles on lipid regulation, but a complete understanding of their redundant and non-redundant functions is missing. We report here a comprehensive analysis of cells having mutations in GPATs and GNPAT, either alone or in combinations. Our results suggest that the balance between GPATs and GNPAT affect the levels of ether lipids, together with glycerophospholipid acyl chain length and unsaturation. In addition, we found that lipid synthesis initiated at peroxisomes, but not mitochondria, is sufficient to provide the lipid synthesis flux required for normal cell growth. Our study unveils the multifaceted roles of the first step of de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis, thus leading to a better understanding of how lipidomes are shaped.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Amoeboid cell migration is key to efficient T cell immunity. Spatial polarization of organelles within cells, including endo-lysosomes, is a prerequisite of migration. However, how ultrastructural polarization is linked to the signaling requirements governing T cell migration, remains unknown. Here we show that signaling molecules generated by endo-lysosome-localized kinases regulate velocity of amoeboid migration. Specifically, imaging of T cells identified accumulation of endo-lysosomes decorated with the lipid kinases VPS34-PIKfyve at the uropod of polarized cells. Activity of VPS34 and PIKfyve regulated speed, but not directedness, of migrating T cells. Mechanistically, PI(3,5)P2 generated by the sequential action of VPS34 and PIKfyve mediated Ca2&#43; efflux from lysosomes via the mucolipin TRP cation channel 1 (TRPML1), thus controlling activity of myosin IIA and hence the generation of propulsive force through retrograde actin flow. The VPS34-PIKfyve kinases also regulated velocity of myeloid cells, as well as of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum - establishing the axis as an evolutionary conserved speed control system of amoeboid cell migration.

Graphical AbstractO_LIThe VPS34-PIKfyve axis is active on endo-lysosomes at the uropod of migrating T cells.
C_LIO_LIVPS34 and PIKfyve promote myosin IIA activation and retrograde action flow.
C_LIO_LIAmoeboid cell migration speed is controlled by VPS34 and PIKfyve via TRPML1.
C_LIO_LIRegulation of amoeboid migration speed is a conserved function of the VPS34-PIKfyve axis.
