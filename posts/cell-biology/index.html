C.; von Einem, J.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.572781\nThe AAA-type ATPase VPS4 is recruited by proteins of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III) to catalyse membrane constriction and membrane fission. VPS4A accumulates at the cytoplasmic viral assembly complex (cVAC) of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the site where nascent virus particles obtain their membrane envelope. Here we show that VPS4A is recruited to the cVAC via interaction with pUL71. Sequence analysis, deep-learning structure prediction, molecular dynamics and mutagenic analysis identify a short peptide motif in the C-terminal region of pUL71 that is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with VPS4A. This motif is predicted to bind the same groove of the N-terminal VPS4A Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domain as the Type 2 MIT-Interacting Motif (MIM2) of cellular ESCRT-III components, and this viral MIM2-like motif (vMIM2) is conserved across {beta}-herpesvirus pUL71 homologues. However, recruitment of VPS4A by pUL71 is dispensable for HCMV morphogenesis or replication and the function of the conserved vMIM2 during infection remains enigmatic. VPS4-recruitment via a vMIM2 represents a previously unknown mechanism of molecular mimicry in viruses, extending previous observations that herpesviruses encode proteins with structural and functional homology to cellular ESCRT-III components.\nConstitutive Endolysosomal Perforation in Neurons allows Induction of alpha-Synuclein Aggregation by Internalized Pre-Formed Fibrils\nAuthors: Sanyal, A.; Scanavachi, G.; Somerville, E.; Saminathan, A.; Nair, A.; Oikonomou, A.; Hatzakis, N. S.; Kirchhausen, T.\nScore: 27.2, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573738\nThe endocytic pathway is both an essential route of molecular uptake in cells and a potential entry point for pathology-inducing cargo. The cell-to-cell spread of cytotoxic aggregates, such as those of -synuclein (-syn) in Parkinsons Disease (PD), exemplifies this duality. Here we used a human iPSC-derived induced neuronal model (iNs) prone to death mediated by aggregation in late endosomes and lysosomes of endogenous -syn, seeded by internalized pre-formed fibrils of -syn (PFFs). This PFF-mediated death was not observed with parental iPSCs or other non-neuronal cells. Using live-cell optical microscopy to visualize the read out of biosensors reporting endo-lysosome wounding, we discovered that up to about 10% of late endosomes and lysosomes in iNs exhibited spontaneous constitutive perforations, regardless of the presence of internalized PFFs. This wounding, absent in parental iPSCs and non-neuronal cells, corresponded to partial damage by nanopores in the limiting membranes of a subset of endolysosomes directly observed by volumetric focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in iNs and in CA1 pyramidal neurons from mouse brain, and not found in iPSCs or in other non-neuronal cells in culture or in mouse liver and skin. We suggest that the compromised limiting membranes in iNs and neurons in general are the primary conduit for cytosolic -syn to access PFFs entrapped within endo-lysosomal lumens, initiating PFF-mediated -syn aggregation. Significantly, eradicating the intrinsic endolysosomal perforations in iNs by inhibiting the endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-Kinase (PIKfyve kinase) using Apilimod or Vacuolin-1 markedly reduced PFF-induced -syn aggregation, despite PFFs continuing to enter the endolysosomal compartment. Crucially, this intervention also diminished iN death associated with PFF incubation. Our results reveal the surprising presence of intrinsically perforated endo-lysosomes in neurons, underscoring their crucial early involvement in the genesis of toxic -syn aggregates induced by internalized PFFs. This discovery offers a basis for employing PIKfyve kinase inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract synucleinopathies.\nShaping up genomes: Prokaryotic roots and eukaryotic diversification of SMC complexes\nAuthors: van Hooff, J. J. E.; Raas, M. W. D.; Tromer, E. C.; Eme, L.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.573240\nAcross the tree of life, SMC complexes organize, segregate and regulate DNA. In contrast to prokaryotes, which often possess one SMC complex, eukaryotes usually have four such complexes. This expanded set is involved in managing the considerably larger nuclear genomes of eukaryotes, which are distributed across multiple chromosomes. Despite their essential functions, SMC complexes exhibit variations across model eukaryotes, suggesting an even greater variety of these complexes that remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to uncover the diversity and evolution of SMC complexes across eukaryotes, and their deeper, prokaryotic evolutionary origins. For this, we conducted in-depth comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SMC complexes. We show that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) likely had fully-fledged versions of all four complexes and that the condensin II complex was later lost at least 30 times in eukaryotes. We report evidence that proteins previously designated as functional analogs in various model organisms (e.g., Sororin, Securin, Nse5 and Nse6) are in fact genuine orthologs. Finally, we traced the prokaryotic origins of these complexes and propose that a single SMC complex duplicated in an early archaeon. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of eukaryotic SMC complex diversity and evolution, both addressing and generating questions about their functioning in ancestral and contemporary organisms.\nIntegrative spatiotemporal map of nucleocytoplasmic transport\nAuthors: Raveh, B.; Eliasian, R.; Rashkovits, S.; Russel, D.; Hayama, R.; Sparks, S.; Singh, D.; Lim, R.; Villa, E.; Rout, M. P.; Cowburn, D.; Sali, A.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573409\nThe Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) facilitates rapid and selective nucleocytoplasmic transport of molecules as large as ribosomal subunits and viral capsids. It is not clear how key emergent properties of this transport arise from the system components and their interactions. To address this question, we constructed an integrative coarse-grained Brownian dynamics model of transport through a single NPC, followed by coupling it with a kinetic model of Ran-dependent transport in an entire cell. The microscopic model parameters were fitted to reflect experimental data and theoretical information regarding the transport, without making any assumptions about its emergent properties. The resulting reductionist model is validated by reproducing several features of transport not used for its construction, such as the morphology of the central transporter, rates of passive and facilitated diffusion as a function of size and valency, in situ radial distributions of pre-ribosomal subunits, and active transport rates for viral capsids. The model suggests that the NPC functions essentially as a virtual gate whose flexible phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat proteins raise an entropy barrier to diffusion through the pore. Importantly, this core functionality is greatly enhanced by several key design features, including fuzzy and transient interactions, multivalency, redundancy in the copy number of FG nucleoporins, exponential coupling of transport kinetics and thermodynamics in accordance with the transition state theory, and coupling to the energy-reliant RanGTP concentration gradient. These design features result in the robust and resilient rate and selectivity of transport for a wide array of cargo ranging from a few kilodaltons to megadaltons in size. By dissecting these features, our model provides a quantitative starting point for rationally modulating the transport system and its artificial mimics.\nKinetoplastid kinetochore proteins KKT14-KKT15 are divergent Bub1/BubR1-Bub3 proteins\nAuthors: Ballmer, D.; Carter, W.; van Hooff, J. J. E.; Tromer, E. C.; Ishii, M.; Ludzia, P.; Akiyoshi, B.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574194\nFaithful transmission of genetic material is crucial for the survival of all organisms. In many eukaryotes, a feedback control mechanism called the spindle checkpoint ensures chromosome segregation fidelity by delaying cell cycle progression until all chromosomes achieve proper attachment to the mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are the macromolecular complexes that act as the interface between chromosomes and spindle microtubules. While most eukaryotes have canonical kinetochore proteins that are widely conserved, kinetoplastids such as Trypanosoma brucei have a seemingly unique set of kinetochore proteins including KKT1-25. Available evidence suggests that T. brucei lacks components of the spindle checkpoint and is unable to delay cell cycle progression in response to spindle defects. It therefore remains poorly understood how kinetoplastids regulate cell cycle progression or ensure chromosome segregation fidelity. Here, we report a crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of KKT14 from Apiculatamorpha spiralis and uncover that it is a pseudokinase. Its structure is most similar to the kinase domain of Bub1, a key component of the spindle checkpoint in other eukaryotes. In addition, KKT14 in T. brucei and other trypanosomatids has a putative ABBA motif that is present in Bub1 and its paralog BubR1. We also find that the N-terminal part of KKT14 interacts with KKT15, whose WD40 repeat beta-propeller is phylogenetically closely related to a direct interactor of Bub1/BubR1 called Bub3. Our findings indicate that KKT14-KKT15 are divergent orthologs of Bub1/BubR1-Bub3, which promote accurate chromosome segregation in trypanosomes.\nA Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST) for the high-throughput quantification of senescence-associated markers\nAuthors: Neri, F.; Takajjart, S. N.; Lerner, C. A.; Desprez, P.-Y.; Schilling, B.; Campisi, J.; Gerencser, A. A.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573123\nCellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions. Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.\nCheckpoint-independent association of Mad3BUBR1 with Stu1CLASP directs homolog alignment in meiosis I\nAuthors: Mukherjee, A.; Spanos, C.; Marston, A. L.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574163\nGametes are produced via meiosis, a specialized cell division associated with frequent errors which cause birth defects and infertility. Uniquely in meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles, usually requiring their linkage by chiasmata, the products of crossover recombination1. The spindle checkpoint delays cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules2 but the steps leading to the capture and alignment of chromosomes on the meiosis I spindle remain poorly understood. In budding yeast meiosis I, Mad2 and Mad3BUBR1 are equally important for spindle checkpoint delay, but biorientation of homologs on the meiosis I spindle requires Mad2, but not Mad3BUBR1 3,4. Here we show that Mad3BUBR1 promotes accurate meiosis I homolog segregation outside its canonical checkpoint role, independently of Mad2. We find that Mad3BUBR1 associates with the TOGL1 domain of Stu1CLASP, a conserved plus-end microtubule protein which is important for chromosome capture onto the spindle. Homologous chromosome pairs that are proficient in crossover formation, but which fail to biorient, rely on Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP to ensure their efficient attachment to microtubules and segregation during meiosis I. Furthermore, we show that Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP are essential to rescue the segregation of mini-chromosomes lacking crossovers. Our findings define a new pathway ensuring microtubule-dependent chromosome capture and demonstrate that spindle checkpoint proteins safeguard the fidelity of chromosome segregation both by actively promoting chromosome alignment and delaying cell cycle progression until this has occurred.\nVascular damage and excessive proliferation compromise liver function after extended hepatectomy in mice\nAuthors: De Rudder, M.; Manco, R.; Coubeau, L.; Fontaine, A.; Bertrand, C.; Leclercq, I.; Dili, A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.573041\nSurgical resection remains the gold standard for liver tumor treatment, yet the emergence of post-operative liver failure, known as the small for size syndrome (SFSS), poses a substantial challenge. The activation of hypoxia sensors in a SFSS liver remnant initiated early angiogenesis, improving vascular architecture, safeguarding against liver failure and reducing mortality. The study aimed to elucidate vascular remodeling mechanisms in SFSS, its impact on hepatocyte function and subsequent liver failure. Mice underwent extended partial hepatectomy to induce SFSS, a subset were exposed to hypoxia immediately after surgery. Hypoxia bolstered post- hepatectomy survival rates. Early proliferation of liver sinusoidal cells coupled with augmented recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) via the VEGF/SDF-1 pathway resulted in heightened vascular density, improved lobular perfusion, and limited hemorrhagic events in the regenerating liver under hypoxia. The administration of G-CSF mimicked the effects of hypoxia on vascular remodeling and EPC recruitment, though it failed to rescue survival. Compared to normoxia, hypoxia restrained hepatocyte proliferation yet improved the function of the regenerating remnant, favoring functional preservation in the liver remnant. Injection of AAV8- TBG-HNF4 virus for hepatocyte-specific overexpression of HNF4, the master regulator of hepatocyte function, enforced functionality in proliferating hepatocytes. The combination, only, of HNF4 overexpression and G-CSF treatment rescued survival post-SFSS-setting hepatectomy. In summary, SFSS arises due to imbalance and desynchronized interplay between functional regeneration and vascular restructuring. To enhance survival following SFSS-hepatectomy, a two- pronged strategy is essential, addressing the preservation of function in the proliferating parenchymal cells alongside the simultaneous mitigation of vascular harm. One Sentence SummaryCombined treatment with G-CSF and HNF4 overexpression rescues vascular damage and function to improve survival after extended hepatectomy in mice.\nTDP-43 pathology links innate and adaptive immunity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAuthors: Evangelista, B.

J.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574541\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common fatal motor neuron disease. Approximately 90% of ALS patients exhibit pathology of the master RNA regulator, Transactive Response DNA Binding protein (TDP-43). Despite the prevalence TDP-43 pathology in ALS motor neurons, recent findings suggest immune dysfunction is a determinant of disease progression in patients. Whether TDP-43 pathology elicits disease-modifying immune responses in ALS remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology is internalized by antigen presenting cells, causes vesicle rupture, and leads to innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Using a multiplex imaging platform, we observed interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells near TDP-43 pathological lesions in ALS brain. We used a mass cytometry-based whole-blood stimulation assay to provide evidence that ALS patient peripheral immune cells exhibit responses to TDP-43 aggregates. Taken together, this study provides a novel link between TDP-43 pathology and ALS immune dysfunction, and further highlights the translational and diagnostic implications of monitoring and manipulating the ALS immune response.

R.; Virta, J. M.; Konstantinidou, M.; Arkin, M. R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573792\nWe report the development of a 384-well formatted NanoBRET assay to characterize molecular glues of 14-3-3/client interactions in living cells. The seven isoforms of 14-3-3 are dimeric hub proteins with diverse roles including transcription factor regulation and signal transduction. 14-3-3 interacts with hundreds of client proteins to regulate their function and is therefore an ideal therapeutic target when client selectivity can be achieved. We have developed the NanoBRET system for three 14-3-3{sigma} client proteins CRAF, TAZ, and estrogen receptor (ER), which represent three specific binding modes. We have measured stabilization of 14-3-3{sigma}/client complexes by molecular glues with EC50 values between 100 nM and 1 M in cells, which align with the EC50 values calculated by fluorescence anisotropy in vitro. Developing this NanoBRET system for the hub protein 14-3-3{sigma} allows for a streamlined approach, bypassing multiple optimization steps in the assay development process for other 14-3-3{sigma} clients. The NanoBRET system allows for an assessment of PPI stabilization in a more physiologically relevant, cell-based environment using full-length proteins. The method is applicable to diverse protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and offers a robust platform to explore libraries of compounds for both PPI stabilizers and inhibitors.

        <p class="abstract">The AAA-type ATPase VPS4 is recruited by proteins of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III) to catalyse membrane constriction and membrane fission. VPS4A accumulates at the cytoplasmic viral assembly complex (cVAC) of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the site where nascent virus particles obtain their membrane envelope. Here we show that VPS4A is recruited to the cVAC via interaction with pUL71. Sequence analysis, deep-learning structure prediction, molecular dynamics and mutagenic analysis identify a short peptide motif in the C-terminal region of pUL71 that is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with VPS4A. This motif is predicted to bind the same groove of the N-terminal VPS4A Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domain as the Type 2 MIT-Interacting Motif (MIM2) of cellular ESCRT-III components, and this viral MIM2-like motif (vMIM2) is conserved across {beta}-herpesvirus pUL71 homologues. However, recruitment of VPS4A by pUL71 is dispensable for HCMV morphogenesis or replication and the function of the conserved vMIM2 during infection remains enigmatic. VPS4-recruitment via a vMIM2 represents a previously unknown mechanism of molecular mimicry in viruses, extending previous observations that herpesviruses encode proteins with structural and functional homology to cellular ESCRT-III components.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endocytic pathway is both an essential route of molecular uptake in cells and a potential entry point for pathology-inducing cargo. The cell-to-cell spread of cytotoxic aggregates, such as those of -synuclein (-syn) in Parkinsons Disease (PD), exemplifies this duality. Here we used a human iPSC-derived induced neuronal model (iNs) prone to death mediated by aggregation in late endosomes and lysosomes of endogenous -syn, seeded by internalized pre-formed fibrils of -syn (PFFs). This PFF-mediated death was not observed with parental iPSCs or other non-neuronal cells. Using live-cell optical microscopy to visualize the read out of biosensors reporting endo-lysosome wounding, we discovered that up to about 10% of late endosomes and lysosomes in iNs exhibited spontaneous constitutive perforations, regardless of the presence of internalized PFFs. This wounding, absent in parental iPSCs and non-neuronal cells, corresponded to partial damage by nanopores in the limiting membranes of a subset of endolysosomes directly observed by volumetric focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in iNs and in CA1 pyramidal neurons from mouse brain, and not found in iPSCs or in other non-neuronal cells in culture or in mouse liver and skin.

We suggest that the compromised limiting membranes in iNs and neurons in general are the primary conduit for cytosolic -syn to access PFFs entrapped within endo-lysosomal lumens, initiating PFF-mediated -syn aggregation. Significantly, eradicating the intrinsic endolysosomal perforations in iNs by inhibiting the endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-Kinase (PIKfyve kinase) using Apilimod or Vacuolin-1 markedly reduced PFF-induced -syn aggregation, despite PFFs continuing to enter the endolysosomal compartment. Crucially, this intervention also diminished iN death associated with PFF incubation.

Our results reveal the surprising presence of intrinsically perforated endo-lysosomes in neurons, underscoring their crucial early involvement in the genesis of toxic -syn aggregates induced by internalized PFFs. This discovery offers a basis for employing PIKfyve kinase inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract synucleinopathies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Across the tree of life, SMC complexes organize, segregate and regulate DNA. In contrast to prokaryotes, which often possess one SMC complex, eukaryotes usually have four such complexes. This expanded set is involved in managing the considerably larger nuclear genomes of eukaryotes, which are distributed across multiple chromosomes. Despite their essential functions, SMC complexes exhibit variations across model eukaryotes, suggesting an even greater variety of these complexes that remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to uncover the diversity and evolution of SMC complexes across eukaryotes, and their deeper, prokaryotic evolutionary origins. For this, we conducted in-depth comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SMC complexes. We show that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) likely had fully-fledged versions of all four complexes and that the condensin II complex was later lost at least 30 times in eukaryotes. We report evidence that proteins previously designated as functional analogs in various model organisms (e.g., Sororin, Securin, Nse5 and Nse6) are in fact genuine orthologs. Finally, we traced the prokaryotic origins of these complexes and propose that a single SMC complex duplicated in an early archaeon. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of eukaryotic SMC complex diversity and evolution, both addressing and generating questions about their functioning in ancestral and contemporary organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) facilitates rapid and selective nucleocytoplasmic transport of molecules as large as ribosomal subunits and viral capsids. It is not clear how key emergent properties of this transport arise from the system components and their interactions. To address this question, we constructed an integrative coarse-grained Brownian dynamics model of transport through a single NPC, followed by coupling it with a kinetic model of Ran-dependent transport in an entire cell. The microscopic model parameters were fitted to reflect experimental data and theoretical information regarding the transport, without making any assumptions about its emergent properties. The resulting reductionist model is validated by reproducing several features of transport not used for its construction, such as the morphology of the central transporter, rates of passive and facilitated diffusion as a function of size and valency, in situ radial distributions of pre-ribosomal subunits, and active transport rates for viral capsids. The model suggests that the NPC functions essentially as a virtual gate whose flexible phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat proteins raise an entropy barrier to diffusion through the pore. Importantly, this core functionality is greatly enhanced by several key design features, including  fuzzy and transient interactions, multivalency, redundancy in the copy number of FG nucleoporins, exponential coupling of transport kinetics and thermodynamics in accordance with the transition state theory, and coupling to the energy-reliant RanGTP concentration gradient. These design features result in the robust and resilient rate and selectivity of transport for a wide array of cargo ranging from a few kilodaltons to megadaltons in size. By dissecting these features, our model provides a quantitative starting point for rationally modulating the transport system and its artificial mimics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Faithful transmission of genetic material is crucial for the survival of all organisms. In many eukaryotes, a feedback control mechanism called the spindle checkpoint ensures chromosome segregation fidelity by delaying cell cycle progression until all chromosomes achieve proper attachment to the mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are the macromolecular complexes that act as the interface between chromosomes and spindle microtubules. While most eukaryotes have canonical kinetochore proteins that are widely conserved, kinetoplastids such as Trypanosoma brucei have a seemingly unique set of kinetochore proteins including KKT1-25. Available evidence suggests that T. brucei lacks components of the spindle checkpoint and is unable to delay cell cycle progression in response to spindle defects. It therefore remains poorly understood how kinetoplastids regulate cell cycle progression or ensure chromosome segregation fidelity. Here, we report a crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of KKT14 from Apiculatamorpha spiralis and uncover that it is a pseudokinase. Its structure is most similar to the kinase domain of Bub1, a key component of the spindle checkpoint in other eukaryotes. In addition, KKT14 in T. brucei and other trypanosomatids has a putative ABBA motif that is present in Bub1 and its paralog BubR1. We also find that the N-terminal part of KKT14 interacts with KKT15, whose WD40 repeat beta-propeller is phylogenetically closely related to a direct interactor of Bub1/BubR1 called Bub3. Our findings indicate that KKT14-KKT15 are divergent orthologs of Bub1/BubR1-Bub3, which promote accurate chromosome segregation in trypanosomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular senescence is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases. Quantification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the lack of senescence-specific markers and generalist, unbiased methodology. Here, we describe the Fully-Automated Senescence Test (FAST), an image-based method for the high-throughput, single-cell assessment of senescence in cultured cells. FAST quantifies three of the most widely adopted senescence-associated markers for each cell imaged: senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-Gal) using X-Gal, proliferation arrest via lack of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and enlarged morphology via increased nuclear area. The presented workflow entails microplate image acquisition, image processing, data analysis, and graphing. Standardization was achieved by i) quantifying colorimetric SA-{beta}-Gal via optical density; ii) implementing staining background controls; iii) automating image acquisition, image processing, and data analysis. We show that FAST accurately quantifies senescence burden and is agnostic to cell type and microscope setup. Moreover, it effectively mitigates false-positive senescence marker staining, a common issue arising from culturing conditions.

Using FAST, we compared X-Gal with fluorescent C12FDG live-cell SA-{beta}-Gal staining on the single-cell level. We observed only a modest correlation between the two, indicating that those stains are not trivially interchangeable. Finally, we provide proof of concept that our method is suitable for screening compounds that exacerbate or mitigate senescence burden (i.e. senescence inducers and senolytics, respectively). This method will be broadly useful to the aging field by enabling rapid, unbiased, and user-friendly quantification of senescence burden in culture, as well as facilitating large-scale experiments that were previously impractical.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gametes are produced via meiosis, a specialized cell division associated with frequent errors which cause birth defects and infertility. Uniquely in meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles, usually requiring their linkage by chiasmata, the products of crossover recombination1. The spindle checkpoint delays cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules2 but the steps leading to the capture and alignment of chromosomes on the meiosis I spindle remain poorly understood. In budding yeast meiosis I, Mad2 and Mad3BUBR1 are equally important for spindle checkpoint delay, but biorientation of homologs on the meiosis I spindle requires Mad2, but not Mad3BUBR1 3,4. Here we show that Mad3BUBR1 promotes accurate meiosis I homolog segregation outside its canonical checkpoint role, independently of Mad2. We find that Mad3BUBR1 associates with the TOGL1 domain of Stu1CLASP, a conserved plus-end microtubule protein which is important for chromosome capture onto the spindle. Homologous chromosome pairs that are proficient in crossover formation, but which fail to biorient, rely on Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP to ensure their efficient attachment to microtubules and segregation during meiosis I. Furthermore, we show that Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP are essential to rescue the segregation of mini-chromosomes lacking crossovers. Our findings define a new pathway ensuring microtubule-dependent chromosome capture and demonstrate that spindle checkpoint proteins safeguard the fidelity of chromosome segregation both by actively promoting chromosome alignment and delaying cell cycle progression until this has occurred.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Surgical resection remains the gold standard for liver tumor treatment, yet the emergence of post-operative liver failure, known as the small for size syndrome (SFSS), poses a substantial challenge. The activation of hypoxia sensors in a SFSS liver remnant initiated early angiogenesis, improving vascular architecture, safeguarding against liver failure and reducing mortality. The study aimed to elucidate vascular remodeling mechanisms in SFSS, its impact on hepatocyte function and subsequent liver failure. Mice underwent extended partial hepatectomy to induce SFSS, a subset were exposed to hypoxia immediately after surgery. Hypoxia bolstered post- hepatectomy survival rates. Early proliferation of liver sinusoidal cells coupled with augmented recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) via the VEGF/SDF-1 pathway resulted in heightened vascular density, improved lobular perfusion, and limited hemorrhagic events in the regenerating liver under hypoxia. The administration of G-CSF mimicked the effects of hypoxia on vascular remodeling and EPC recruitment, though it failed to rescue survival. Compared to normoxia, hypoxia restrained hepatocyte proliferation yet improved the function of the regenerating remnant, favoring functional preservation in the liver remnant. Injection of AAV8- TBG-HNF4 virus for hepatocyte-specific overexpression of HNF4, the master regulator of hepatocyte function, enforced functionality in proliferating hepatocytes. The combination, only, of HNF4 overexpression and G-CSF treatment rescued survival post-SFSS-setting hepatectomy. In summary, SFSS arises due to imbalance and desynchronized interplay between functional regeneration and vascular restructuring. To enhance survival following SFSS-hepatectomy, a two- pronged strategy is essential, addressing the preservation of function in the proliferating parenchymal cells alongside the simultaneous mitigation of vascular harm.

One Sentence SummaryCombined treatment with G-CSF and HNF4 overexpression rescues vascular damage and function to improve survival after extended hepatectomy in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common fatal motor neuron disease. Approximately 90% of ALS patients exhibit pathology of the master RNA regulator, Transactive Response DNA Binding protein (TDP-43). Despite the prevalence TDP-43 pathology in ALS motor neurons, recent findings suggest immune dysfunction is a determinant of disease progression in patients. Whether TDP-43 pathology elicits disease-modifying immune responses in ALS remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology is internalized by antigen presenting cells, causes vesicle rupture, and leads to innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Using a multiplex imaging platform, we observed interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells near TDP-43 pathological lesions in ALS brain. We used a mass cytometry-based whole-blood stimulation assay to provide evidence that ALS patient peripheral immune cells exhibit responses to TDP-43 aggregates. Taken together, this study provides a novel link between TDP-43 pathology and ALS immune dysfunction, and further highlights the translational and diagnostic implications of monitoring and manipulating the ALS immune response.

        <p class="abstract">We report the development of a 384-well formatted NanoBRET assay to characterize molecular glues of 14-3-3/client interactions in living cells. The seven isoforms of 14-3-3 are dimeric hub proteins with diverse roles including transcription factor regulation and signal transduction. 14-3-3 interacts with hundreds of client proteins to regulate their function and is therefore an ideal therapeutic target when client selectivity can be achieved. We have developed the NanoBRET system for three 14-3-3{sigma} client proteins CRAF, TAZ, and estrogen receptor  (ER), which represent three specific binding modes. We have measured stabilization of 14-3-3{sigma}/client complexes by molecular glues with EC50 values between 100 nM and 1 M in cells, which align with the EC50 values calculated by fluorescence anisotropy in vitro. Developing this NanoBRET system for the hub protein 14-3-3{sigma} allows for a streamlined approach, bypassing multiple optimization steps in the assay development process for other 14-3-3{sigma} clients. The NanoBRET system allows for an assessment of PPI stabilization in a more physiologically relevant, cell-based environment using full-length proteins. The method is applicable to diverse protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and offers a robust platform to explore libraries of compounds for both PPI stabilizers and inhibitors.
