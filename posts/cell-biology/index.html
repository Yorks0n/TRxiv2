M.; Shalem, O.\nScore: 32.3, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548759\nThe field of induced proximity therapeutics is in its ascendancy but is limited by a lack of scalable tools to systematically explore effector-target protein pairs in an unbiased manner. Here, we combined Scalable POoled Targeting with a LIgandable Tag at Endogenous Sites (SPOTLITES) for the high-throughput tagging of endogenous proteins, with generic small molecule-based protein recruitment to screen for novel proximity-based effectors. We apply this methodology in two orthogonal screens for targeted protein degradation: the first using fluorescence to monitor target protein levels directly, and the second using a cellular growth phenotype that depends on the degradation of an essential protein. Our screens revealed a multitude of potential new effector proteins for degradation and converged on members of the CTLH complex which we demonstrate potently induce degradation. Altogether, we introduce a platform for pooled induction of endogenous protein-protein interactions that can be used to expand our toolset of effector proteins for targeted protein degradation and other forms of induced proximity.\nPooled tagging and hydrophobic targeting of endogenous proteins for unbiased mapping of unfolded protein responses\nAuthors: Sansbury, S. E.; Serebrenik, Y. V.; Lapidot, T.; Burslem, G. M.; Shalem, O.\nScore: 30.6, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548611\nSystem-level understanding of proteome organization and function requires methods for direct visualization and manipulation of proteins at scale. We developed an approach enabled by high-throughput gene tagging for the generation and analysis of complex cell pools with endogenously tagged proteins. Proteins are tagged with HaloTag to enable visualization or direct perturbation. Fluorescent labeling followed by in situ sequencing and deep learning-based image analysis identifies the localization pattern of each tag, providing a birds-eye-view of cellular organization. Next, we use a hydrophobic HaloTag ligand to misfold tagged proteins, inducing spatially restricted proteotoxic stress that is read out by single cell RNA sequencing. By integrating optical and perturbation data, we map compartment-specific responses to protein misfolding, revealing inter-compartment organization and direct crosstalk, and assigning proteostasis functions to uncharacterized genes. Altogether, we present a powerful and efficient method for large-scale studies of proteome dynamics, function, and homeostasis.\nOncostatin M is a Master Regulator of an Inflammatory Network in Dnmt3a-Mutant Hematopoietic Stem Cells\nAuthors: Schwartz, L. S.; Young, K. A.; Stearns, T. M.; Boyer, N.; Mujica, K. D.; Trowbridge, J. J.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548764\nAge-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identify Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to aging-driven Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We find that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young mice do not functionally respond to acute OSM stimulation with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoietic engraftment, or myeloid differentiation. However, young Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs transcriptionally upregulate an inflammatory cytokine network in response to acute OSM stimulation including genes encoding IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF. In addition, OSM-stimulated Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate the anti-inflammatory genes Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1, creating a negative feedback loop limiting sustained activation of the inflammatory network. In the context of an aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment with chronically elevated levels of OSM, Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate pro-inflammatory genes but do not upregulate Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1. Together, our work suggests that chronic inflammation with aging exhausts the regulatory mechanisms in young CH-mutant HSCs that resolve inflammatory states, and that OSM is a master regulator of an inflammatory network that contributes to age-associated CH.\nmRNA condensation fluidizes the cytoplasm\nAuthors: Xie, Y.; Liu, T.; Gresham, D.; Holt, L. J.\nScore: 72.4, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.542963\nThe intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.\nSelf-extinguishing relay waves enable homeostaticcontrol of human neutrophil swarming\nAuthors: Strickland, J.; Pan, D.; Godfrey, C.; Kim, J. S.; Hopke, A.; Degrange, M.; Villavicencio, B.; Mansour, M. K.; Zerbe, C. S.; Irimia, D.; Amir, A.; Weiner, O. D.\nScore: 568.8, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546744\nNeutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.\nMulti-monoubiquitination controls VASP-mediated actin dynamics\nAuthors: McCormick, L. E.; Suarez, C.; Herring, L. E.; Cannon, K. S.; Kovar, D. R.; Brown, N. G.; Gupton, S. L.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549237\nThe actin cytoskeleton performs multiple cellular functions, and as such, actin polymerization must be tightly regulated. We previously demonstrated that reversible, non-degradative ubiquitination regulates the function of the actin polymerase VASP in developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism of how ubiquitination impacts VASP activity was unknown. Here we show that mimicking multi-monoubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 negatively regulates VASP interactions with actin. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate the reduced ability of multi-monoubiquitinated VASP to bind, bundle, and elongate actin filaments. However, multi-monoubiquitinated VASP maintained the ability to bind and protect barbed ends from capping protein. Lastly, we demonstrate the introduction of recombinant multi-monoubiquitinated VASP protein altered cell spreading morphology. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism in which ubiquitination controls VASP-mediated actin dynamics.\nPolyubiquitinated PCNA promotes alternative lengthening of telomeres by inducing break-induced replication\nAuthors: Kim, S.; Kang, N.; Ra, J. S.; Park, S. H.; Myung, K.; Lee, K.-y.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548953\nReplication stresses are the major source of break-induced replication (BIR). Here, we show that in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells, replication stress-induced polyubiquitinated PCNA (polyUb-PCNA) triggers BIR at telomeres and the common fragile site (CFS). Consistently, depleting RAD18, a PCNA ubiquitinating enzyme, reduces the occurrence of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres and CFS, both of which are mediated by BIR. In contrast, inhibiting USP1, an Ub-PCNA deubiquitinating enzyme, results in an increase in the above phenotypes in a RAD18- and UBC13 (the PCNA polyubiquitinating enzyme)-dependent manner. Furthermore, deficiency of ATAD5, which facilitates USP1 activity and unloads PCNAs, augments recombination-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, telomeric polyUb-PCNA accumulates SLX4, a nuclease scaffold, at telomeres through its ubiquitin-binding domain and increases telomere damage. Consistently, APB increase induced by Ub-PCNA depends on SLX4 and SLX4-associated nucleases. Taken together, our results identified the polyUb-PCNA-SLX4 axis as a trigger for directing BIR.\nThree-step docking by WIPI2, ATG16L1 and ATG3 delivers LC3 to the phagophore\nAuthors: Rao, S.; Strong, L. M.; Ren, X.; Skulsuppaisarn, M.; Lazarou, M.; Hurley, J. H.; Hummer, G.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549391\nThe covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.\nMulti-tissue proteomics identifies a link between satellite DNA organization and transgenerational transposon repression in Drosophila\nAuthors: Chavan, A.; Skrutl, L.; Uliana, F.; Pfister, M.; Burke, D. F.; Braendle, F.; Beltrao, P.; Jagannathan, M.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548599\nThe pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes primarily consists of abundant non-coding repeats known as satellite DNA, which promote accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. During interphase, sequence-specific satellite DNA-binding proteins cluster repeats from multiple chromosomes into foci known as chromocenters, which function to encapsulate the entire genome in a single nucleus. Despite the pivotal role of satellite DNA-binding proteins and chromocenters in cellular function, the proteins associated with these repetitive sequences remains incompletely characterized. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in Drosophila embryos, ovaries and testes using two satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits. We identify nearly 500 interactions, including known heterochromatin-associated proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters. Among these interactions, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with chromocenters. Strikingly, we reveal that proper satellite DNA clustering plays a role in transgenerational transposon repression, such that mothers with disrupted chromocenters give rise to progeny that exhibit transposon de-repression, germ cell loss and gonadal atrophy. Overall, our study highlights a novel link between satellite DNA repeats and transposon repression and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of satellite DNA function across tissues.\nUbiquitination-mediated Golgi-to-endosome sorting determines the poison-antidote duality of wtf meiotic drivers\nAuthors: Zheng, J.-X.; Du, T.-Y.; Shao, G.-C.; Ma, Z.-H.; Jiang, Z.-D.; Hu, W.; Suo, F.; He, W.; Dong, M.-Q.; Du, L.-L.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549172\nKiller meiotic drivers (KMDs) skew allele transmission in their favor by killing meiotic progeny not inheriting the driver allele. Despite their widespread presence in eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms behind their selfish behavior are poorly understood. Here we investigate how the poison and antidote products of a fission yeast wtf-family KMD gene can act antagonistically. Both the poison and the antidote are multi-transmembrane proteins, differing only in their N-terminal cytosolic tails. We find that the antidote employs N-terminal PY motifs to bind Rsp5/NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitinate the antidote. Mutating PY motifs or attaching a deubiquitinating enzyme transforms the antidote into a toxic protein. Ubiquitination promotes the transport of the antidote from the trans-Golgi network to the endosome, thereby neutralizing its toxicity and that of the bound poison. We propose that post-translational modification-mediated protein localization and/or activity changes may be a common mechanism governing the antagonistic duality of single-gene KMDs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The field of induced proximity therapeutics is in its ascendancy but is limited by a lack of scalable tools to systematically explore effector-target protein pairs in an unbiased manner. Here, we combined Scalable POoled Targeting with a LIgandable Tag at Endogenous Sites (SPOTLITES) for the high-throughput tagging of endogenous proteins, with generic small molecule-based protein recruitment to screen for novel proximity-based effectors. We apply this methodology in two orthogonal screens for targeted protein degradation: the first using fluorescence to monitor target protein levels directly, and the second using a cellular growth phenotype that depends on the degradation of an essential protein. Our screens revealed a multitude of potential new effector proteins for degradation and converged on members of the CTLH complex which we demonstrate potently induce degradation. Altogether, we introduce a platform for pooled induction of endogenous protein-protein interactions that can be used to expand our toolset of effector proteins for targeted protein degradation and other forms of induced proximity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">System-level understanding of proteome organization and function requires methods for direct visualization and manipulation of proteins at scale. We developed an approach enabled by high-throughput gene tagging for the generation and analysis of complex cell pools with endogenously tagged proteins. Proteins are tagged with HaloTag to enable visualization or direct perturbation. Fluorescent labeling followed by in situ sequencing and deep learning-based image analysis identifies the localization pattern of each tag, providing a birds-eye-view of cellular organization. Next, we use a hydrophobic HaloTag ligand to misfold tagged proteins, inducing spatially restricted proteotoxic stress that is read out by single cell RNA sequencing. By integrating optical and perturbation data, we map compartment-specific responses to protein misfolding, revealing inter-compartment organization and direct crosstalk, and assigning proteostasis functions to uncharacterized genes. Altogether, we present a powerful and efficient method for large-scale studies of proteome dynamics, function, and homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identify Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to aging-driven Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We find that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young mice do not functionally respond to acute OSM stimulation with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoietic engraftment, or myeloid differentiation. However, young Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs transcriptionally upregulate an inflammatory cytokine network in response to acute OSM stimulation including genes encoding IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF. In addition, OSM-stimulated Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate the anti-inflammatory genes Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1, creating a negative feedback loop limiting sustained activation of the inflammatory network. In the context of an aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment with chronically elevated levels of OSM, Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate pro-inflammatory genes but do not upregulate Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1. Together, our work suggests that chronic inflammation with aging exhausts the regulatory mechanisms in young CH-mutant HSCs that resolve inflammatory states, and that OSM is a master regulator of an inflammatory network that contributes to age-associated CH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The actin cytoskeleton performs multiple cellular functions, and as such, actin polymerization must be tightly regulated. We previously demonstrated that reversible, non-degradative ubiquitination regulates the function of the actin polymerase VASP in developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism of how ubiquitination impacts VASP activity was unknown. Here we show that mimicking multi-monoubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 negatively regulates VASP interactions with actin. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate the reduced ability of multi-monoubiquitinated VASP to bind, bundle, and elongate actin filaments. However, multi-monoubiquitinated VASP maintained the ability to bind and protect barbed ends from capping protein. Lastly, we demonstrate the introduction of recombinant multi-monoubiquitinated VASP protein altered cell spreading morphology. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism in which ubiquitination controls VASP-mediated actin dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Replication stresses are the major source of break-induced replication (BIR). Here, we show that in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells, replication stress-induced polyubiquitinated PCNA (polyUb-PCNA) triggers BIR at telomeres and the common fragile site (CFS). Consistently, depleting RAD18, a PCNA ubiquitinating enzyme, reduces the occurrence of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres and CFS, both of which are mediated by BIR. In contrast, inhibiting USP1, an Ub-PCNA deubiquitinating enzyme, results in an increase in the above phenotypes in a RAD18- and UBC13 (the PCNA polyubiquitinating enzyme)-dependent manner. Furthermore, deficiency of ATAD5, which facilitates USP1 activity and unloads PCNAs, augments recombination-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, telomeric polyUb-PCNA accumulates SLX4, a nuclease scaffold, at telomeres through its ubiquitin-binding domain and increases telomere damage. Consistently, APB increase induced by Ub-PCNA depends on SLX4 and SLX4-associated nucleases. Taken together, our results identified the polyUb-PCNA-SLX4 axis as a trigger for directing BIR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The covalent attachment of ubiquitin-like LC3 proteins prepares the autophagic membrane for cargo recruitment. We resolve key steps in LC3 lipidation by combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in vitro and in cellulo. We show how the E3-like ligase ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 in complex with the E2-like conjugase ATG3 docks LC3 onto the membrane in three steps by (1) the PI(3)P effector protein WIPI2, (2) helix 2 of ATG16L1, and (3) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids concentrate in a region around the thioester bond between ATG3 and LC3, highlighting residues with a possible role in the catalytic transfer of LC3 to PE, including two conserved histidines. In a near-complete pathway from the initial membrane recruitment to the LC3 lipidation reaction, the three-step targeting of the ATG12--ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery establishes a high level of regulatory control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes primarily consists of abundant non-coding repeats known as satellite DNA, which promote accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. During interphase, sequence-specific satellite DNA-binding proteins cluster repeats from multiple chromosomes into foci known as chromocenters, which function to encapsulate the entire genome in a single nucleus. Despite the pivotal role of satellite DNA-binding proteins and chromocenters in cellular function, the proteins associated with these repetitive sequences remains incompletely characterized. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in Drosophila embryos, ovaries and testes using two satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits. We identify nearly 500 interactions, including known heterochromatin-associated proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters. Among these interactions, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with chromocenters. Strikingly, we reveal that proper satellite DNA clustering plays a role in transgenerational transposon repression, such that mothers with disrupted chromocenters give rise to progeny that exhibit transposon de-repression, germ cell loss and gonadal atrophy. Overall, our study highlights a novel link between satellite DNA repeats and transposon repression and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of satellite DNA function across tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) skew allele transmission in their favor by killing meiotic progeny not inheriting the driver allele. Despite their widespread presence in eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms behind their selfish behavior are poorly understood. Here we investigate how the poison and antidote products of a fission yeast wtf-family KMD gene can act antagonistically. Both the poison and the antidote are multi-transmembrane proteins, differing only in their N-terminal cytosolic tails. We find that the antidote employs N-terminal PY motifs to bind Rsp5/NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitinate the antidote. Mutating PY motifs or attaching a deubiquitinating enzyme transforms the antidote into a toxic protein. Ubiquitination promotes the transport of the antidote from the trans-Golgi network to the endosome, thereby neutralizing its toxicity and that of the bound poison. We propose that post-translational modification-mediated protein localization and/or activity changes may be a common mechanism governing the antagonistic duality of single-gene KMDs.</p>
