ATG2 is an essential autophagy protein, but ATG2 also localizes to lipid droplets (LDs), and genetic depletion of ATG2 increases LD numbers while impairing fatty acid transport from LDs to mitochondria. How ATG2 supports LD homeostasis and whether lipid transport regulates this homeostasis remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that ATG2 is preferentially recruited to phospholipid monolayers such as those surrounding LDs rather than to phospholipid bilayers. In vitro, ATG2 can drive phospholipid transport from artificial LDs with rates that correlate with the binding affinities, such that phospholipids are moved much more efficiently when one of the ATG2-interacting structures is an artificial LD. ATG2 is thought to exhibit bridge-like\" lipid transport, with lipids flowing across the protein between membranes. We mutated key amino acids within the bridge to form a transport-dead ATG2 mutant (TD-ATG2A) which we show specifically blocks bridge-like, but not shuttle-like, lipid transport in vitro. TD-ATG2A still localizes to LDs, but is unable to rescue LD accumulation in ATG2 knockout cells. Thus, ATG2 has a natural affinity for, and an enhanced activity upon LD surfaces and uses bridge-like lipid transport to support LD dynamics in cells.\nNon-homologous end joining shapes the genomic rearrangement landscape of chromothripsis from mitotic errors\nAuthors: Hu, Q.; Espejo Valle-Inclan, J.; Dahiya, R.; Guyer, A.; Mazzagatti, A.; Maurais, E. G.; Engel, J. L.; Cortes-Ciriano, I.; Ly, P.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552800\nErrors in mitosis can generate micronuclei that entrap mis-segregated chromosomes, which are susceptible to catastrophic fragmentation through a process termed chromothripsis. The reassembly of fragmented chromosomes by error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair generates a spectrum of simple and complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with human cancers and disorders. How specific DSB repair pathways recognize and process these lesions remains poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to systematically inactivate distinct DSB processing or repair pathways and interrogated the rearrangement landscape of fragmented chromosomes from micronuclei. Deletion of canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components, including DNA-PKcs, LIG4, and XLF, substantially reduced the formation of complex rearrangements and shifted the rearrangement landscape toward simple alterations without the characteristic patterns of cancer-associated chromothripsis. Following reincorporation into the nucleus, fragmented chromosomes localize within micronuclei bodies (MN bodies) and undergo successful ligation by NHEJ within a single cell cycle. In the absence of NHEJ, chromosome fragments were rarely engaged by polymerase theta-mediated alternative end-joining or recombination-based mechanisms, resulting in delayed repair kinetics and persistent 53BP1-labeled MN bodies in the interphase nucleus. Prolonged DNA damage signaling from unrepaired fragments ultimately triggered cell cycle arrest. Thus, we provide evidence supporting NHEJ as the exclusive DSB repair pathway generating complex rearrangements following chromothripsis from mitotic errors.\nF-box protein FBXB-65 regulates anterograde transport of UNC-104 through modification near the PH domain\nAuthors: Sabharwal, V.; Boyanapalli, S. P. P.; Shee, A.; Nonet, M. L.; Nandi, A.; Chaudhuri, D.; Koushika, S. P.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553108\nAxonal transport is essential for cargo movement between the neuronal cell body and synapses. UNC-104/KIF1A, a Kinesin-3 motor in C. elegans that anterogradely transports precursors of synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), is known to be degraded at synapses through the ubiquitin pathway. Knockdown of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, uba-1, leads to increased accumulation of UNC-104 at neuronal ends and at synapses of touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Loss of the F-box protein FBXB-65, a putative E3 ligase, leads to UNC-104 accumulation at distal ends of neurons, alters net anterograde movement of UNC-104, and the intensity of moving UNC-104 puncta likely bound to cargo without changes in synaptic UNC-104 levels. Using a theoretical model, we analyze the steady state distribution of the anterogradely moving UNC-104 motor. A good agreement between the model and the experimental distributions leads to a crucial hypothesis that UNC-104 may exhibit cooperative binding with moving motor puncta likely associated with cargo, which is regulated by fbxb-65. FBXB-65 regulates the modification of UNC-104 motor in a region besides the cargo binding PH-domain. Both fbxb-65 and UNC-104 motor independent of FBXB-65 regulate the extent of cargo transport in the axon and transport behaviour of cargo at branch points. Our study shows that modification of UNC-104 near its cargo-binding domain may regulate number of motors on the cargo surface and this regulation can fine-tune cargo transport to its destination, the synapse.\nErythroid differentiation dependent interaction of VPS13A with XK at the plasma membrane of K562 cells\nAuthors: Amos, C.; Xu, P.; De Camilli, P.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552634\nMutations of the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13A and of the lipid scramblase XK result in Chorea Acanthocytosis (ChAc) and McLeod syndrome (MLS) respectively, two similar conditions involving neurodegeneration and deformed erythrocytes (acanthocytes). VPS13A binds XK, suggesting a model in which VPS13A forms a lipid transport bridge between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM) where XK resides. However, studies of VPS13A in HeLa and COS7 cells showed that this protein localizes primarily at contacts of the ER with mitochondria. Overexpression of XK in these cells redistributed VPS13A to the biosynthetic XK pool in the ER but not to PM localized XK. Colocalization of VPS13A with XK at the PM was only observed if overexpressed XK harbored mutations that disengage its VPS13A binding site from an intramolecular interaction. As the acanthocytosis phenotype of ChAc and MLS suggests a role of the two proteins in cells of the erythroid lineage, we explored their localization in K562 cells, which differentiate into erythroblasts upon hemin addition. When tagged VPS13A was overexpressed in hemin treated K562 cells, robust formation of ER-PM contacts positive for VPS13A were observed and their formation was abolished in XK KO cells. ER-PM contacts positive for VPS13A were seldomly observed in undifferentiated K562 cells, in spite of the presence of XK in these cells at concentrations similar to those observed after differentiation. These findings reveal that the interaction of VPS13A with XK at ER-PM contacts requires a permissive state which depends upon cell type and/or functional state of the cell.\nMultivalent GU-rich oligonucleotides sequester TDP-43 in the nucleus by inducing high molecular weight RNP complexes\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Das, T.; Kalab, P.; Hayes, L. R.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551528\nThe loss of nuclear TDP-43 localization and its accumulation in cytoplasmic aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegeneration and major therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that TDP-43 binding to endogenous nuclear GU-rich RNAs sequesters TDP-43 in the nucleus and restricts its passive nuclear export. Here, we tested the feasibility of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide-mediated augmentation of TDP-43 nuclear localization. Using biochemical assays, we compared the ability of GU-rich oligonucleotides to engage in multivalent, RRM-dependent binding with TDP-43 and identified (GU)16 as a strong multivalent binder. When transfected into cells, unlike monovalent oligonucleotides that displaced TDP-43 from the nucleus, (GU)16 preserved steady-state TDP-43 nuclear localization and prevented transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 mislocalization. RNA pulldowns from (GU)16-transfected cells confirmed that (GU)16 induced high molecular weight RNP complexes, incorporating TDP-43 and possibly other GU-binding proteins. Transfected (GU)16 caused partial failure of TDP-43 cryptic exon repression, likely because the high-affinity oligonucleotides diverted TDP-43 from endogenous RNAs. Thus, while GU-rich oligonucleotides can attenuate TDP-43 mislocalization, optimization is needed to avoid TDP-43 loss of function.\nEpithelial cell chirality emerges through the dynamic concentric pattern of actomyosin cytoskeleton\nAuthors: Yamamoto, T.; Ishibashi, T.; Mimori-Kiyosue, Y.; Hiver, S.; Tokushige, N.; Tarama, M.; Takeichi, M.; Shibata, T.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553476\nThe chirality of tissues and organs is essential for their function and development. Tissue-level chirality derives from the chirality of individual cells that comprise the tissue, and cellular chirality is considered to emerge through the organization of chiral molecules within the cell. However, the principle of how molecular chirality leads to cellular chirality is still unclear. To address this question, we experimentally studied the chiral behaviors of isolated epithelial cells derived from a carcinoma line and developed a theoretical understanding of how their behaviors arise from molecular-level chirality. We first found that the nucleus rotates, and the cytoplasm circulates in a clockwise direction in a cell. During the rotation, actin and myosin IIA are organized into stress fibers with a vortex-like chiral orientation at the ventral side of the cell periphery, simultaneously forming thin filaments with a concentric orientation at the dorsal level of the cell. Lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that these concentric filaments moved in a clockwise direction, suggesting their potential involvement in the rotation of intracellular components. On the other hand, when stress fibers with chiral orientations were removed by drug treatment, cells still exhibited intracellular rotation, implying that the cells generate rotational force without any macroscopic cell-scale chiral orientational order of the cytoskeleton. To elucidate how concentric actomyosin filaments induce chiral rotation, we analyzed a hydrodynamic model considering the microscopic chirality of actomyosin filaments. Our experiments and theory suggest that cell chirality emerges driven by the microscopic chirality of actomyosin rather than the macroscopic chiral orientational order. Significance statementCell chirality, the fundamental asymmetry of cells, originates from molecular chirality, and plays a crucial role in establishing the left-right asymmetry of organs and tissues. Active torque induced by the cytoskeleton has been implicated in the mechanism behind cell chirality. However, the precise organization of molecular-scale torque driving cell chirality remains elusive. In our study, we observed a clockwise rotational motion of the nucleus and cytoplasm in singly isolated epithelial cells derived from a colorectal carcinoma line. Our investigation suggests that the non-chiral structure formed by actin and myosin II is responsible for driving cell chirality. Our theory, based on active hydrodynamics, further suggests that the concentric orientation of actomyosin induces the clockwise cytoplasmic flow.\nThe pore-forming apolipoprotein APOL7C drives phagosomal rupture and antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells\nAuthors: Gonzales, G. A.; Huang, S.; Rajwani, J.; Wilkinson, L.; Nguyen, J. A.; Wood, C. M.; Moore, M.; Cedeno, E.; Sikdar, S.; McKenna, N.; Ebacher, V.; Rosin, N. L.; Carneiro, M. B.; Surewaard, B.; Peters, N. C.; Biernaskie, J.; Mahoney, D. J.; Yates, R. M.; Canton, J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553042\nType I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are essential for the generation of protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against many types of viruses and tumours. They do so by internalizing antigens from virally infected or tumour cells and presenting them to CD8+ T cells in a process known as cross-presentation (XP). Despite the obvious biological importance of XP, the molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unclear. Here, we show that a cDC-specific pore-forming protein called apolipoprotein 7C (APOL7C) is upregulated in response to innate immune stimuli and is recruited to phagosomes. Strikingly, the association of APOL7C with phagosomes leads to phagosomal rupture, which in turn allows for the escape of engulfed protein antigens to the cytosol where they can be processed via the endogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing pathway. We show that APOL7C recruitment to phagosomes is voltage-dependent and occurs in response to NADPH oxidase-induced depolarization of the phagosomal membrane. Our data indicate the presence of dedicated pore-forming apolipoproteins that mediate the delivery of phagocytosed proteins to the cytosol of activated cDC1s to facilitate MHC class I presentation of exogenous antigen and to regulate adaptive immunity.\nCyclin B3 is a dominant fast-acting cyclin that drives rapid early embryonic mitoses\nAuthors: Lara-Gonzalez, P.; Variyar, S.; Budrewicz, J.; Schlientz, A.; Varshney, N.; Bellaart, A.; Moghareh, S.; Nguyen, A. C. N.; Oegema, K.; Desai, A.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553011\nIn many species, early embryonic mitoses proceed at a very rapid pace, but how this pace is achieved is not understood. Here we show that in the early C. elegans embryo, cyclin B3 is the dominant driver of rapid embryonic mitoses. Metazoans typically have three cyclin B isoforms that associate with and activate Cdk1 kinase to orchestrate mitotic events: the related cyclins B1 and B2 and the more divergent cyclin B3. We show that whereas embryos expressing cyclins B1 and B2 support slow mitosis (NEBD to Anaphase [~] 600s), the presence of cyclin B3 dominantly drives the [~]3-fold faster mitosis observed in wildtype embryos. CYB-1/2-driven mitosis is longer than CYB-3-driven mitosis primarily because the progression of mitotic events itself is slower, rather than delayed anaphase onset due to activation of the spindle checkpoint or inhibitory phosphorylation of the anaphase activator CDC-20. Addition of cyclin B1 to cyclin B3-only mitosis introduces an [~]60s delay between the completion of chromosome alignment and anaphase onset, which likely ensures segregation fidelity; this delay is mediated by inhibitory phosphorylation on CDC-20. Thus, the dominance of cyclin B3 in driving mitotic events, coupled to introduction of a short cyclin B1-dependent delay in anaphase onset, sets the rapid pace and ensures fidelity of mitoses in the early C. elegans embryo.\nEndogenous BAX and BAK form mosaic rings of variable size and composition on apoptotic mitochondria\nAuthors: Schweighofer, S. V.; Jans, D. C.; Keller-Findeisen, J.; Folmeg, A.; Bates, M.; Jakobs, S.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553869\nOne hallmark of apoptosis is the oligomerization of BAX and BAK to form a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates the release of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol. Cells overexpressing BAX or BAK fusion proteins are a powerful model system to study the dynamics and localization of these proteins in cells. However, it is unclear whether overexpressed BAX and BAK form the same ultrastructural assemblies following the same temporal hierarchy as endogenously expressed proteins. Combining live- and fixed-cell STED super-resolution microscopy, we show that overexpression of BAK results in novel BAK structures, which are virtually absent in non-overexpressing apoptotic cells. We further demonstrate that in wildtype cells, BAK is recruited to apoptotic pores before BAX. Both proteins together form unordered, mosaic rings on apoptotic mitochondria in immortalized cell culture models as well as in human primary cells. In BAX- or BAK- single-knockout cells, the remaining protein is able to form rings independently. The heterogeneous nature of these rings corroborates the toroidal apoptotic pore model.\nStructural basis for coupling of the WASH subunit FAM21 with the endosomal SNX27-Retromer complex\nAuthors: Guo, Q.; Chen, K.-E.; Gimenez-Andres, M.; Jellett, A.; Gao, Y.; Simonetti, B.; Liu, M.; Danson, C.; Heesom, K. J.; Cullen, P. J.; Collins, B. M.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553351\nEndosomal membrane trafficking is mediated by specific protein coats and formation of actin-rich membrane domains. The Retromer complex coordinates with sorting nexin (SNX) cargo adaptors including SNX27, and the SNX27-Retromer assembly interacts with the WASH complex which nucleates actin filaments establishing the endosomal reycling domain. Crystal structures, modelling, biochemical and cellular validation reveal how the FAM21 subunit of WASH interacts with both Retromer and SNX27. FAM21 binds the FERM domain of SNX27 using acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs similar to those found in the SNX1 and SNX2 subunits of the ESCPE-1 complex. Overlapping FAM21 repeats and a specific Pro-Leu containing motif bind three distinct sites on Retromer involving both the VPS35 and VPS29 subunits. However, mutation of the major VPS35-binding site does not inhibit cargo recycling, indicating that a network of redundant interactions promote endosomal activity of the WASH complex. These studies establish the molecular basis for how SNX27-Retromer is coupled to the WASH complex via overlapping and multiplexed motif-based interactions required for the dynamic assembly of endosomal membrane recycling domains.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ATG2 proteins facilitate bulk lipid transport between membranes. ATG2 is an essential autophagy protein, but ATG2 also localizes to lipid droplets (LDs), and genetic depletion of ATG2 increases LD numbers while impairing fatty acid transport from LDs to mitochondria. How ATG2 supports LD homeostasis and whether lipid transport regulates this homeostasis remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that ATG2 is preferentially recruited to phospholipid monolayers such as those surrounding LDs rather than to phospholipid bilayers. In vitro, ATG2 can drive phospholipid transport from artificial LDs with rates that correlate with the binding affinities, such that phospholipids are moved much more efficiently when one of the ATG2-interacting structures is an artificial LD. ATG2 is thought to exhibit  bridge-like&#34; lipid transport, with lipids flowing across the protein between membranes. We mutated key amino acids within the bridge to form a transport-dead ATG2 mutant (TD-ATG2A) which we show specifically blocks bridge-like, but not shuttle-like, lipid transport in vitro. TD-ATG2A still localizes to LDs, but is unable to rescue LD accumulation in ATG2 knockout cells. Thus, ATG2 has a natural affinity for, and an enhanced activity upon LD surfaces and uses bridge-like lipid transport to support LD dynamics in cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Errors in mitosis can generate micronuclei that entrap mis-segregated chromosomes, which are susceptible to catastrophic fragmentation through a process termed chromothripsis. The reassembly of fragmented chromosomes by error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair generates a spectrum of simple and complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with human cancers and disorders. How specific DSB repair pathways recognize and process these lesions remains poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to systematically inactivate distinct DSB processing or repair pathways and interrogated the rearrangement landscape of fragmented chromosomes from micronuclei. Deletion of canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components, including DNA-PKcs, LIG4, and XLF, substantially reduced the formation of complex rearrangements and shifted the rearrangement landscape toward simple alterations without the characteristic patterns of cancer-associated chromothripsis. Following reincorporation into the nucleus, fragmented chromosomes localize within micronuclei bodies (MN bodies) and undergo successful ligation by NHEJ within a single cell cycle. In the absence of NHEJ, chromosome fragments were rarely engaged by polymerase theta-mediated alternative end-joining or recombination-based mechanisms, resulting in delayed repair kinetics and persistent 53BP1-labeled MN bodies in the interphase nucleus. Prolonged DNA damage signaling from unrepaired fragments ultimately triggered cell cycle arrest. Thus, we provide evidence supporting NHEJ as the exclusive DSB repair pathway generating complex rearrangements following chromothripsis from mitotic errors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Axonal transport is essential for cargo movement between the neuronal cell body and synapses. UNC-104/KIF1A, a Kinesin-3 motor in C. elegans that anterogradely transports precursors of synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), is known to be degraded at synapses through the ubiquitin pathway. Knockdown of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, uba-1, leads to increased accumulation of UNC-104 at neuronal ends and at synapses of touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Loss of the F-box protein FBXB-65, a putative E3 ligase, leads to UNC-104 accumulation at distal ends of neurons, alters net anterograde movement of UNC-104, and the intensity of moving UNC-104 puncta likely bound to cargo without changes in synaptic UNC-104 levels. Using a theoretical model, we analyze the steady state distribution of the anterogradely moving UNC-104 motor. A good agreement between the model and the experimental distributions leads to a crucial hypothesis that UNC-104 may exhibit cooperative binding with moving motor puncta likely associated with cargo, which is regulated by fbxb-65. FBXB-65 regulates the modification of UNC-104 motor in a region besides the cargo binding PH-domain. Both fbxb-65 and UNC-104 motor independent of FBXB-65 regulate the extent of cargo transport in the axon and transport behaviour of cargo at branch points. Our study shows that modification of UNC-104 near its cargo-binding domain may regulate number of motors on the cargo surface and this regulation can fine-tune cargo transport to its destination, the synapse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations of the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13A and of the lipid scramblase XK result in Chorea Acanthocytosis (ChAc) and McLeod syndrome (MLS) respectively, two similar conditions involving neurodegeneration and deformed erythrocytes (acanthocytes). VPS13A binds XK, suggesting a model in which VPS13A forms a lipid transport bridge between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM) where XK resides. However, studies of VPS13A in HeLa and COS7 cells showed that this protein localizes primarily at contacts of the ER with mitochondria. Overexpression of XK in these cells redistributed VPS13A to the biosynthetic XK pool in the ER but not to PM localized XK. Colocalization of VPS13A with XK at the PM was only observed if overexpressed XK harbored mutations that disengage its VPS13A binding site from an intramolecular interaction. As the acanthocytosis phenotype of ChAc and MLS suggests a role of the two proteins in cells of the erythroid lineage, we explored their localization in K562 cells, which differentiate into erythroblasts upon hemin addition. When tagged VPS13A was overexpressed in hemin treated K562 cells, robust formation of ER-PM contacts positive for VPS13A were observed and their formation was abolished in XK KO cells. ER-PM contacts positive for VPS13A were seldomly observed in undifferentiated K562 cells, in spite of the presence of XK in these cells at concentrations similar to those observed after differentiation. These findings reveal that the interaction of VPS13A with XK at ER-PM contacts requires a permissive state which depends upon cell type and/or functional state of the cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The loss of nuclear TDP-43 localization and its accumulation in cytoplasmic aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegeneration and major therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that TDP-43 binding to endogenous nuclear GU-rich RNAs sequesters TDP-43 in the nucleus and restricts its passive nuclear export. Here, we tested the feasibility of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide-mediated augmentation of TDP-43 nuclear localization. Using biochemical assays, we compared the ability of GU-rich oligonucleotides to engage in multivalent, RRM-dependent binding with TDP-43 and identified (GU)16 as a strong multivalent binder. When transfected into cells, unlike monovalent oligonucleotides that displaced TDP-43 from the nucleus, (GU)16 preserved steady-state TDP-43 nuclear localization and prevented transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 mislocalization. RNA pulldowns from (GU)16-transfected cells confirmed that (GU)16 induced high molecular weight RNP complexes, incorporating TDP-43 and possibly other GU-binding proteins. Transfected (GU)16 caused partial failure of TDP-43 cryptic exon repression, likely because the high-affinity oligonucleotides diverted TDP-43 from endogenous RNAs. Thus, while GU-rich oligonucleotides can attenuate TDP-43 mislocalization, optimization is needed to avoid TDP-43 loss of function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The chirality of tissues and organs is essential for their function and development. Tissue-level chirality derives from the chirality of individual cells that comprise the tissue, and cellular chirality is considered to emerge through the organization of chiral molecules within the cell. However, the principle of how molecular chirality leads to cellular chirality is still unclear. To address this question, we experimentally studied the chiral behaviors of isolated epithelial cells derived from a carcinoma line and developed a theoretical understanding of how their behaviors arise from molecular-level chirality. We first found that the nucleus rotates, and the cytoplasm circulates in a clockwise direction in a cell. During the rotation, actin and myosin IIA are organized into stress fibers with a vortex-like chiral orientation at the ventral side of the cell periphery, simultaneously forming thin filaments with a concentric orientation at the dorsal level of the cell. Lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that these concentric filaments moved in a clockwise direction, suggesting their potential involvement in the rotation of intracellular components. On the other hand, when stress fibers with chiral orientations were removed by drug treatment, cells still exhibited intracellular rotation, implying that the cells generate rotational force without any macroscopic cell-scale chiral orientational order of the cytoskeleton. To elucidate how concentric actomyosin filaments induce chiral rotation, we analyzed a hydrodynamic model considering the microscopic chirality of actomyosin filaments. Our experiments and theory suggest that cell chirality emerges driven by the microscopic chirality of actomyosin rather than the macroscopic chiral orientational order.

Significance statementCell chirality, the fundamental asymmetry of cells, originates from molecular chirality, and plays a crucial role in establishing the left-right asymmetry of organs and tissues. Active torque induced by the cytoskeleton has been implicated in the mechanism behind cell chirality. However, the precise organization of molecular-scale torque driving cell chirality remains elusive. In our study, we observed a clockwise rotational motion of the nucleus and cytoplasm in singly isolated epithelial cells derived from a colorectal carcinoma line. Our investigation suggests that the non-chiral structure formed by actin and myosin II is responsible for driving cell chirality. Our theory, based on active hydrodynamics, further suggests that the concentric orientation of actomyosin induces the clockwise cytoplasmic flow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are essential for the generation of protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against many types of viruses and tumours. They do so by internalizing antigens from virally infected or tumour cells and presenting them to CD8&#43; T cells in a process known as cross-presentation (XP). Despite the obvious biological importance of XP, the molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unclear. Here, we show that a cDC-specific pore-forming protein called apolipoprotein 7C (APOL7C) is upregulated in response to innate immune stimuli and is recruited to phagosomes. Strikingly, the association of APOL7C with phagosomes leads to phagosomal rupture, which in turn allows for the escape of engulfed protein antigens to the cytosol where they can be processed via the endogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing pathway. We show that APOL7C recruitment to phagosomes is voltage-dependent and occurs in response to NADPH oxidase-induced depolarization of the phagosomal membrane. Our data indicate the presence of dedicated pore-forming apolipoproteins that mediate the delivery of phagocytosed proteins to the cytosol of activated cDC1s to facilitate MHC class I presentation of exogenous antigen and to regulate adaptive immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In many species, early embryonic mitoses proceed at a very rapid pace, but how this pace is achieved is not understood. Here we show that in the early C. elegans embryo, cyclin B3 is the dominant driver of rapid embryonic mitoses. Metazoans typically have three cyclin B isoforms that associate with and activate Cdk1 kinase to orchestrate mitotic events: the related cyclins B1 and B2 and the more divergent cyclin B3. We show that whereas embryos expressing cyclins B1 and B2 support slow mitosis (NEBD to Anaphase [~] 600s), the presence of cyclin B3 dominantly drives the [~]3-fold faster mitosis observed in wildtype embryos. CYB-1/2-driven mitosis is longer than CYB-3-driven mitosis primarily because the progression of mitotic events itself is slower, rather than delayed anaphase onset due to activation of the spindle checkpoint or inhibitory phosphorylation of the anaphase activator CDC-20. Addition of cyclin B1 to cyclin B3-only mitosis introduces an [~]60s delay between the completion of chromosome alignment and anaphase onset, which likely ensures segregation fidelity; this delay is mediated by inhibitory phosphorylation on CDC-20. Thus, the dominance of cyclin B3 in driving mitotic events, coupled to introduction of a short cyclin B1-dependent delay in anaphase onset, sets the rapid pace and ensures fidelity of mitoses in the early C. elegans embryo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One hallmark of apoptosis is the oligomerization of BAX and BAK to form a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates the release of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol. Cells overexpressing BAX or BAK fusion proteins are a powerful model system to study the dynamics and localization of these proteins in cells. However, it is unclear whether overexpressed BAX and BAK form the same ultrastructural assemblies following the same temporal hierarchy as endogenously expressed proteins. Combining live- and fixed-cell STED super-resolution microscopy, we show that overexpression of BAK results in novel BAK structures, which are virtually absent in non-overexpressing apoptotic cells. We further demonstrate that in wildtype cells, BAK is recruited to apoptotic pores before BAX. Both proteins together form unordered, mosaic rings on apoptotic mitochondria in immortalized cell culture models as well as in human primary cells. In BAX- or BAK- single-knockout cells, the remaining protein is able to form rings independently. The heterogeneous nature of these rings corroborates the toroidal apoptotic pore model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endosomal membrane trafficking is mediated by specific protein coats and formation of actin-rich membrane domains. The Retromer complex coordinates with sorting nexin (SNX) cargo adaptors including SNX27, and the SNX27-Retromer assembly interacts with the WASH complex which nucleates actin filaments establishing the endosomal reycling domain. Crystal structures, modelling, biochemical and cellular validation reveal how the FAM21 subunit of WASH interacts with both Retromer and SNX27. FAM21 binds the FERM domain of SNX27 using acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs similar to those found in the SNX1 and SNX2 subunits of the ESCPE-1 complex. Overlapping FAM21 repeats and a specific Pro-Leu containing motif bind three distinct sites on Retromer involving both the VPS35 and VPS29 subunits. However, mutation of the major VPS35-binding site does not inhibit cargo recycling, indicating that a network of redundant interactions promote endosomal activity of the WASH complex. These studies establish the molecular basis for how SNX27-Retromer is coupled to the WASH complex via overlapping and multiplexed motif-based interactions required for the dynamic assembly of endosomal membrane recycling domains.</p>
