The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.\nPervasive mislocalization of pathogenic coding variants underlying human disorders\nAuthors: Lacoste, J.; Haghighi, M.; Haider, S.; Lin, Z.-Y.; Segal, D.; Reno, C.; Qian, W. W.; Xiong, X.; Shafqat-Abbasi, H.; Ryder, P.; Senft, R.; Cimini, B.; Roth, F.; Calderwood, M.; Hill, D.; Vidal, M.; Yi, S.; Sahni, N.; Peng, J.; Gingras, A.-C.; Singh, S.; Carpenter, A.; Taipale, M.\nScore: 35.4, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556368\nWidespread sequencing has yielded thousands of missense variants predicted or confirmed as disease-causing. This creates a new bottleneck: determining the functional impact of each variant - largely a painstaking, customized process undertaken one or a few genes or variants at a time. Here, we established a high-throughput imaging platform to assay the impact of coding variation on protein localization, evaluating 3,547 missense variants of over 1,000 genes and phenotypes. We discovered that mislocalization is a common consequence of coding variation, affecting about one-sixth of all pathogenic missense variants, all cellular compartments, and recessive and dominant disorders alike. Mislocalization is primarily driven by effects on protein stability and membrane insertion rather than disruptions of trafficking signals or specific interactions. Furthermore, mislocalization patterns help explain pleiotropy and disease severity and provide insights on variants of unknown significance. Our publicly available resource will likely accelerate the understanding of coding variation in human diseases.\nUnraveling human hematopoietic progenitor cell diversity through association with intrinsic regulatory factors\nAuthors: Favaro, P.; Glass, D. R.; Borges, L.; Reemar, R. B.; Reynolds, W.; Ho, D.; Bruce, T.; Tebaykin, D.; Scalon, V. M.; Shestopalov, I.; Bendall, S. C.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555623\nHematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is an essential therapy for hematological conditions, but finer definitions of human HSPC subsets with associated function could enable better tuning of grafts and more routine, lower-risk application. To deeply phenotype HSPCs, following a screen of 328 antigens, we quantified 41 surface proteins and functional regulators on millions of CD34+ and CD34- cells, spanning four primary human hematopoietic tissues: bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and fetal liver. We propose more granular definitions of HSPC subsets and provide new, detailed differentiation trajectories of erythroid and myeloid lineages. These aspects of our revised human hematopoietic model were validated with corresponding epigenetic analysis and in vitro clonal differentiation assays. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of using molecular regulators as surrogates for cellular identity and functional potential, providing a framework for description, prospective isolation, and cross-tissue comparison of HSPCs in humans.\nMechanosensitive recruitment of Vinculin maintains junction integrity and barrier function at epithelial tricellular junctions\nAuthors: van den Goor, L. M.; Iseler, J.; Koning, K.; Miller, A. L.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556899\nApical cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), adhere epithelial cells to one another and regulate selective permeability at both bicellular junctions (BCJs) and tricellular junctions (TCJs). Although several specialized proteins are known to localize at TCJs, it remains unclear how actomyosin-mediated tension transmission at TCJs contributes to the maintenance of junction integrity and barrier function at these sites. Here, utilizing gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system, we describe a mechanism by which Vinculin, a mechanosensitive protein, anchors the actomyosin network at TCJs, thus maintaining TJ stability and barrier function. Using an optogenetic approach, we found that acutely increasing junctional tension results in robust recruitment of Vinculin to apical junctions immediately surrounding TCJs. In Vinculin knockdown (KD) embryos, junctional actomyosin intensity is decreased and becomes disorganized at TCJs. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that loss of Vinculin results in reduced Actin stability at TCJs. Vinculin knockdown also destabilizes Angulin-1, a key protein involved in regulating barrier function at TCJs. When Vinculin KD embryos are subjected to increased tension, TCJs cannot maintain their proper morphology. Finally, using a live imaging barrier assay, we detect increased barrier leaks at TCJs in Vinculin KD embryos. Together, our findings show that Vinculin-mediated actomyosin organization is required to maintain junction integrity and barrier function at TCJs and reveal new information about the interplay between adhesion and barrier function at TCJs.\nRNA binding proteins and glycoRNAs form domains on the cell surface for cell penetrating peptide entry\nAuthors: Perr, J.; Langen, A.; Almahayni, K.; Nestola, G.; Chai, P.; Lebedenko, C.; Volk, R.; Caldwell, R.; Spiekermann, M.; Hemberger, H.; Bisaria, N.; Tzelepis, K.; Calo, E.; Mockl, L.; Zaro, B.; Flynn, R. A.\nScore: 53.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556039\nThe composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.\nVisualizing interactions of VDAC1 in live cells using a tetracysteine tag\nAuthors: Pilic, J.; Oflaz, F. E.; Gottschalk, B.; Erdogan, Y. C.; Graier, W. F.; Malli, R.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556841\nThe voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a crucial gatekeeper in the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlling metabolic and energy homeostasis. The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we used the tetracysteine (TC)-tag approach and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The majority of VDAC1-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Additionally, VDAC1 was found at mitochondrial fission sites, likely promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in multiple cellular processes.\nWeak neuronal glycolysis sustains cognition and organismal fitness\nAuthors: Jimenez-Blasco, D.; Agulla, J.; Lapresa, R.; Garcia-Macia, M.; Bobo-Jimenez, V.; Garcia-Rodriguez, D.; Manjarres-Raza, I.; Fernandez, E.; Jeanson, Y.; Khoury, S.; Portais, J.-C.; Padro, D.; Ramos-Cabrer, P.; Carmeliet, P.; Almeida, A.; Bolanos, J. P.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556016\nThe energy cost of neuronal activity is mainly sustained by glucose1,2. However, in an apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis3,4,5,6, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3)3,7,8, a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD+ reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.\nAutophagy counters inflammation-driven glycolytic impairment in aging hematopoietic stem cells\nAuthors: Dellorusso, P. V.; Proven, M. A.; Calero-Nieto, F. J.; Wang, X.; Mitchell, C. A.; Hartmann, F.; Amouzgar, M.; Favaro, P.; DeVilbiss, A. W.; Swann, J. W.; Ho, T. T.; Zhao, Z. W.; Bendall, S. C.; Morrison, S. J.; Gottgens, B.; Passegue, E.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553736\nAging of the hematopoietic system promotes various blood, immune and systemic disorders and is largely driven by hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction (1). Autophagy is central for the benefits associated with activation of longevity signaling programs (2), and for HSC function and response to nutrient stress (3,4). With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves some regenerative capacity, while the rest fail to engage autophagy and become metabolically overactivated and dysfunctional (4). However, the signals that promote autophagy in old HSCs and the mechanisms responsible for the increased regenerative potential of autophagy-activated old HSCs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy activation is an adaptive survival response to chronic inflammation in the aging bone marrow (BM) niche (5). We find that inflammation impairs glucose metabolism and suppresses glycolysis in aged HSCs through Socs3-mediated impairment of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling. In this context, we show that inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserves functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we demonstrate that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glucose uptake and glycolytic flux and significantly improves old HSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity. One-Sentence SummaryAutophagy compensates for chronic inflammation-induced metabolic deregulation in old HSCs, and its transient modulation can reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity.\nAutophagy adaptors mediate Parkin-dependent mitophagy by forming sheet-like liquid condensates\nAuthors: Yang, Z.; Yoshii, S. R.; Sakai, Y.; Chino, H.; Knorr, R. L.; Mizushima, N.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557117\nDuring PINK1 and Parkin-mediated mitophagy, autophagy adaptors are recruited to depolarized mitochondria to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Autophagy adaptors such as OPTN and NDP52 bridge mitochondria and autophagosomal membranes by binding to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins and autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN and NDP52 form sheet-like phase-separated condensates with liquid-like properties on the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria. The dynamic and liquid-like feature of OPTN condensates is important for mitophagy activity because reducing the liquidity of OPTN-ubiquitin condensates suppresses the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and impairs mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like model of autophagy adaptors, in contrast to a stoichiometric model, to explain their interactions between autophagic membranes (i.e., ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes) and mitochondrial membranes during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. This model underscores the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in facilitating membrane-membrane contacts, likely through the generation of capillary forces.\nStructure of Native Chromatin Fibres Revealed by Cryo-ET in situ\nAuthors: Hou, Z.; Nightingale, F.; Zhu, Y.; MacGregor-Chatwin, C.; Zhang, P.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556082\nThe structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Widespread sequencing has yielded thousands of missense variants predicted or confirmed as disease-causing. This creates a new bottleneck: determining the functional impact of each variant - largely a painstaking, customized process undertaken one or a few genes or variants at a time. Here, we established a high-throughput imaging platform to assay the impact of coding variation on protein localization, evaluating 3,547 missense variants of over 1,000 genes and phenotypes. We discovered that mislocalization is a common consequence of coding variation, affecting about one-sixth of all pathogenic missense variants, all cellular compartments, and recessive and dominant disorders alike. Mislocalization is primarily driven by effects on protein stability and membrane insertion rather than disruptions of trafficking signals or specific interactions. Furthermore, mislocalization patterns help explain pleiotropy and disease severity and provide insights on variants of unknown significance. Our publicly available resource will likely accelerate the understanding of coding variation in human diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is an essential therapy for hematological conditions, but finer definitions of human HSPC subsets with associated function could enable better tuning of grafts and more routine, lower-risk application. To deeply phenotype HSPCs, following a screen of 328 antigens, we quantified 41 surface proteins and functional regulators on millions of CD34&#43; and CD34- cells, spanning four primary human hematopoietic tissues: bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and fetal liver. We propose more granular definitions of HSPC subsets and provide new, detailed differentiation trajectories of erythroid and myeloid lineages. These aspects of our revised human hematopoietic model were validated with corresponding epigenetic analysis and in vitro clonal differentiation assays. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of using molecular regulators as surrogates for cellular identity and functional potential, providing a framework for description, prospective isolation, and cross-tissue comparison of HSPCs in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apical cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), adhere epithelial cells to one another and regulate selective permeability at both bicellular junctions (BCJs) and tricellular junctions (TCJs). Although several specialized proteins are known to localize at TCJs, it remains unclear how actomyosin-mediated tension transmission at TCJs contributes to the maintenance of junction integrity and barrier function at these sites. Here, utilizing gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system, we describe a mechanism by which Vinculin, a mechanosensitive protein, anchors the actomyosin network at TCJs, thus maintaining TJ stability and barrier function. Using an optogenetic approach, we found that acutely increasing junctional tension results in robust recruitment of Vinculin to apical junctions immediately surrounding TCJs. In Vinculin knockdown (KD) embryos, junctional actomyosin intensity is decreased and becomes disorganized at TCJs. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that loss of Vinculin results in reduced Actin stability at TCJs. Vinculin knockdown also destabilizes Angulin-1, a key protein involved in regulating barrier function at TCJs. When Vinculin KD embryos are subjected to increased tension, TCJs cannot maintain their proper morphology. Finally, using a live imaging barrier assay, we detect increased barrier leaks at TCJs in Vinculin KD embryos. Together, our findings show that Vinculin-mediated actomyosin organization is required to maintain junction integrity and barrier function at TCJs and reveal new information about the interplay between adhesion and barrier function at TCJs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a crucial gatekeeper in the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlling metabolic and energy homeostasis. The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we used the tetracysteine (TC)-tag approach and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The majority of VDAC1-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Additionally, VDAC1 was found at mitochondrial fission sites, likely promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in multiple cellular processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The energy cost of neuronal activity is mainly sustained by glucose1,2. However, in an apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis3,4,5,6, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3)3,7,8, a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD&#43; reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging of the hematopoietic system promotes various blood, immune and systemic disorders and is largely driven by hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction (1). Autophagy is central for the benefits associated with activation of longevity signaling programs (2), and for HSC function and response to nutrient stress (3,4). With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves some regenerative capacity, while the rest fail to engage autophagy and become metabolically overactivated and dysfunctional (4). However, the signals that promote autophagy in old HSCs and the mechanisms responsible for the increased regenerative potential of autophagy-activated old HSCs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy activation is an adaptive survival response to chronic inflammation in the aging bone marrow (BM) niche (5). We find that inflammation impairs glucose metabolism and suppresses glycolysis in aged HSCs through Socs3-mediated impairment of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling. In this context, we show that inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserves functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we demonstrate that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glucose uptake and glycolytic flux and significantly improves old HSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity.

One-Sentence SummaryAutophagy compensates for chronic inflammation-induced metabolic deregulation in old HSCs, and its transient modulation can reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During PINK1 and Parkin-mediated mitophagy, autophagy adaptors are recruited to depolarized mitochondria to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Autophagy adaptors such as OPTN and NDP52 bridge mitochondria and autophagosomal membranes by binding to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins and autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN and NDP52 form sheet-like phase-separated condensates with liquid-like properties on the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria. The dynamic and liquid-like feature of OPTN condensates is important for mitophagy activity because reducing the liquidity of OPTN-ubiquitin condensates suppresses the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and impairs mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like model of autophagy adaptors, in contrast to a stoichiometric model, to explain their interactions between autophagic membranes (i.e., ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes) and mitochondrial membranes during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. This model underscores the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in facilitating membrane-membrane contacts, likely through the generation of capillary forces.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.</p>
