We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.\nOrientation-Independent-DIC imaging reveals that a transient rise in macromolecular crowding contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation\nAuthors: Iida, S.; Ide, S.; Tamura, S.; Tani, T.; Goto, T.; Shribak, M.; Maeshima, K.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566679\nGenomic information must be faithfully transmitted into two daughter cells during cell division. To ensure the transmission process, interphase chromatin is further condensed into mitotic chromosomes. Although protein factors like condensins and topoisomerase II are involved in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, the physical bases of the condensation process remain unclear. Macromolecular crowding/depletion force, an effective attractive force that arises between large structures in crowded environments around chromosomes, may contribute to the condensation process. To approach this issue, we investigated the \"chromosome milieu\" during mitosis of living human cells using orientation-independent-differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) module combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, which is capable of precisely mapping optical path differences and estimating molecular densities. We found that the molecular density surrounding chromosomes increased with the progression from prometaphase to anaphase, concurring with chromosome condensation. However, the molecular density went down in telophase, when chromosome decondensation began. Changes in the molecular density around chromosomes by hypotonic or hypertonic treatment consistently altered the condensation levels of chromosomes. In vitro, native chromatin was converted into liquid droplets of chromatin in the presence of cations and a macromolecular crowder. Additional crowder made the chromatin droplets stiffer and more solid-like, with further condensation. These results suggest that a transient rise in macromolecular crowding (proteins and RNAs), likely triggered by the relocation of macromolecules via nuclear envelope breakdown and also by a subsequent decrease in cell-volumes, contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation, shedding light on a new aspect of the condensation mechanism in living human cells. Significance StatementMitotic chromosome condensation is an essential process to transmit replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells during cell division. To study the underlying physical principles of this process, we focused on macromolecular crowding/depletion force, which is a force that attracts large structures in crowded cell environments. Using newly developed special light microscopy, which can image the molecular density of cellular environments, we found that crowding around chromosomes increases during cell division. In vitro, higher concentrations of macromolecules condense chromatin and make it stiffer and more solid-like. Our results suggest that the rise in macromolecular crowding renders chromosomes more rigid, ensuring accurate chromosome transmission during cell division.\nA nuclear architecture screen in Drosophila identifies Stonewall as a link between chromatin position at the nuclear periphery and germline stem cell fate\nAuthors: Chavan, A.; Isenhart, R.; Nguyen, S. C.; Kotb, N.; Harke, J.; Sintsova, A.; Ulukaya, G.; Uliana, F.; Ashiono, C.; Kutay, U.; Pegoraro, G.; Rangan, P.; Joyce, E. F.; Jagannathan, M.\nScore: 18.3, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567611\nThe association of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery is proposed to facilitate cell-type specific gene repression and influence cell fate decisions. However, the interplay between gene position and expression remains incompletely understood, in part because the proteins that position genomic loci at the nuclear periphery remain unidentified. Here, we used an Oligopaint-based HiDRO screen targeting ~1000 genes to discover novel regulators of nuclear architecture in Drosophila cells. We identified the heterochromatin-associated protein, Stonewall (Stwl), as a factor promoting perinuclear chromatin positioning. In female germline stem cells (GSCs), Stwl binds and positions chromatin loci, including GSC differentiation genes, at the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, Stwl-dependent perinuclear positioning is associated with transcriptional repression, highlighting a likely mechanism for the known role of Stwl in GSC maintenance and ovary homeostasis. Thus, our study identifies perinuclear anchors in Drosophila and demonstrates the importance of gene repression at the nuclear periphery for cell fate.\nMyospreader improves gene editing in skeletal muscle by myonuclear propagation\nAuthors: Poukalov, K.; Valero, M. C.; Muscato, D.; Adams, L.; Chun, H.; Lee, Y. i. T.; Andrade, N.; Zeier, Z.; Sweeney, H. L.; Wang, E. T.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565807\nSuccessful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify \"Myospreader\", a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.\nCell-specific alpha-tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 generate a non-canonical transition zone\nAuthors: Akella, J. S.; Silva, M. S.; Nguyen, K. C. Q.; Hall, D. H.; Barr, M. M.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567340\nThe transition zone (TZ) regulates cilia composition and function. Canonical TZs with 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) are common but non-canonical TZs that vary from 9 MT symmetry also occur and arise through unknown mechanisms. Cilia on the quadrant inner labial type 2 (IL2Q) neurons of C. elegans have a specialized non-canonical TZ with fewer than 9 doublet MTs. We previously showed that non-canonical TZs in IL2Q cilia arise via MT loss and reorganization of canonical TZs. Here, we identify structural events and mechanisms that generate non-canonical TZs. Cell-specific alpha-tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 regulate IL2QTZ MT loss without affecting ciliary assembly. Our results reveal a role for the tubulin code in generating non-canonical TZs and contribute towards understanding ciliary functional specialization.\nRFX6 haploinsufficiency predisposes to diabetes through impaired beta cell functionality\nAuthors: Ibrahim, H.; Balboa, D.; Saarimäki-Vire, J.; Montaser, H.; Dyachok, O.; Lund, P.-E.; Omar-Hmeadi, M.; Kvist, J.; Dwivedi, O. P.; Lithovius, V.; Barsby, T.; Chandra, V.; Eurola, S.; Ustinov, J.; Tuomi, T.; Miettinen, P. J.; Barg, S.; Tengholm, A.; Otonkoski, T.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567202\nRegulatory factor X 6 (RFX6) is indispensable for pancreatic endocrine development and differentiation. The RFX6 protein-truncating variant p.His293LeufsTer7 is significantly enriched in the Finnish population with almost 1:250 individuals as a carrier. Importantly, the FinnGen study indicates a high predisposition for heterozygous carriers to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes. To understand the role of this variant in {beta}-cell development and function, we generated allelic series of isogenic pluripotent stem cell models and directed them into pancreatic islet lineages (SC-islets). Expectedly, in-vitro models of the homozygous RFX6-/- variant failed to generate pancreatic endocrine cells, recapitulating the phenotype in Mitchell-Riley syndrome. Notably, heterozygous RFX6+/- derived SC-islets showed reduced {beta}-cell maturation markers and calcium oscillations, resulting in defective insulin secretion, without affecting {beta}-cell number or insulin content. The reduced insulin secretion is sustained during in-vivo implantation studies, consistent with the susceptibility of the carriers to develop diabetes. TeaserModeling RFX6-assocciated neonatal and type-2 diabetes using allelic series stem cell-derived islets in-vitro and in-vivo.\nCharacterisation and correction of polarisation effects in fluorescently labelled fibres\nAuthors: Aggarwal, N.; Marsh, R.; Marcotti, S.; Shaw, T. J.; Stramer, B.; Cox, S.; Culley, S.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566047\nMany biological structures take the form of fibres and filaments, and quantitative analysis of fibre organisation is important for understanding their functions in both normal physiological conditions and disease. In order to visualise these structures, fibres can be fluorescently labelled and imaged, with specialised image analysis methods available for quantifying the degree and strength of fibre alignment. Here we show that fluorescently labelled fibres can display polarised emission, with the strength of this effect varying depending on structure and fluorophore identity. This can bias automated analysis of fibre alignment and mask the true underlying structural organisation. We present a method for quantifying and correcting these polarisation effects without requiring polarisation resolved microscopy, and demonstrate its efficacy when applied to images of fluorescently labelled collagen gels, allowing for more reliable characterisation of fibre microarchitecture.\nMulti-functional ARF1 compartments serve as a hub for short-range cargo transfer to endosomes\nAuthors: Stockhammer, A.; Adarska, P.; Natalia, V.; Heuhsen, A.; Klemt, A.; Harel, S.; Rodilla-Ramirez, C.; Spalt, C.; Oezsoy, E.; Leupold, P.; Grindel, A.; Fox, E.; Mejedo, J. O.; Puchkov, D.; Haucke, V.; Bottanelli, F.\nScore: 28.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564143\nCellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.\nPrior Fc Receptor activation primes macrophages for increased sensitivity to IgG via long term and short term mechanisms\nAuthors: Bond, A.; Fiaz, S.; Rollins, K. R.; Nario, J. E. Q.; Rosen, S. J.; Granados, A.; Wilson, M. Z.; Morrissey, M. A.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567059\nMacrophages measure the eat-me signal IgG to identify targets for phagocytosis. We wondered if prior encounters with IgG influence macrophage appetite. IgG is recognized by the Fc Receptor. To temporally control Fc Receptor activation, we engineered an Fc Receptor that is activated by light-induced oligomerization of Cry2, triggering phagocytosis. Using this tool, we demonstrate that Fc Receptor activation primes macrophages to be more sensitive to IgG in future encounters. Macrophages that have previously experienced Fc Receptor activation eat more IgG-bound cancer cells. Increased phagocytosis occurs by two discrete mechanisms - a short- and long-term priming. Long term priming requires new protein synthesis and Erk activity. Short term priming does not require new protein synthesis and correlates with an increase in Fc Receptor mobility. Our work demonstrates that IgG primes macrophages for increased phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies may become more effective after initial priming doses.\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells constitute a major route for hemoglobin clearance\nAuthors: Zurawska, G.; Sas, Z.; Jonczy, A.; Slusarczyk, P.; Mahadeva, R.; Chwalek, M.; Kulecka, M.; Rumienczyk, I.; Moulin, M.; Jastrzebski, K.; Mikula, M.; Etzerodt, A.; Miaczynska, M.; Rygiel, T. P.; Mleczko-Sanecka, K.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.566925\nMild hemolysis of senescent erythrocytes occurs physiologically in the spleen, resulting in hemoglobin (Hb) release, whereas pathologic erythrocyte rupture characterizes several diseases. Iron recycling from Hb and Hb detoxification have been attributed to the sequestration of Hb-haptoglobin complexes by macrophages. However, we found the existence of additional efficient Hb clearance routes in mice. We identified liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) as the primary cells responsible for Hb sequestration, a process that involves macropinocytosis and operates independently of the Hb-haptoglobin receptor CD163. LSECs expressed heme oxygenase 1 and hepcidin-controlled ferroportin and were the most efficient cellular scavengers of Hb at doses below and above the haptoglobin binding capacity. Erythrocyte transfusion assays further demonstrated that while splenic red pulp macrophages are adept at erytrophagocytosis, liver Kupffer cells and LSECs mainly clear erythrocyte ghosts and Hb, respectively, transported from the spleen via the portal circulation. High-dose Hb injections in mice resulted in transient hepatic iron retention and early activation of the gene encoding heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) in LSECs. This response was associated with the transcriptional induction of the iron-sensing angiokine Bmp6, culminating in hepcidin-mediated transient serum hypoferremia. Injection of Hb and iron citrate elicited distinct transcriptional signatures in LSECs, and the Bmp6 induction was phenocopied by erythrocyte lysis upon phenylhydrazine. Collectively, we propose that LSECs provide a key mechanism for Hb clearance, a function that establishes the spleen-liver axis for physiological iron recycling from Hb and contributes to heme detoxification during hemolysis, coupled with the induction of the BMP6-hepcidin axis, ultimately restoring iron homeostasis. Key points- LSECs engage macropinocytosis to efficiently scavenge free hemoglobin - LSEC-mediated hemoglobin clearance participates in iron recycling from spleen-derived hemoglobin and contributes to its detoxification during hemolysis\n",

        <p class="abstract">Assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic information must be faithfully transmitted into two daughter cells during cell division. To ensure the transmission process, interphase chromatin is further condensed into mitotic chromosomes. Although protein factors like condensins and topoisomerase II are involved in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, the physical bases of the condensation process remain unclear. Macromolecular crowding/depletion force, an effective attractive force that arises between large structures in crowded environments around chromosomes, may contribute to the condensation process. To approach this issue, we investigated the &#34;chromosome milieu&#34; during mitosis of living human cells using orientation-independent-differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) module combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, which is capable of precisely mapping optical path differences and estimating molecular densities. We found that the molecular density surrounding chromosomes increased with the progression from prometaphase to anaphase, concurring with chromosome condensation. However, the molecular density went down in telophase, when chromosome decondensation began. Changes in the molecular density around chromosomes by hypotonic or hypertonic treatment consistently altered the condensation levels of chromosomes. In vitro, native chromatin was converted into liquid droplets of chromatin in the presence of cations and a macromolecular crowder. Additional crowder made the chromatin droplets stiffer and more solid-like, with further condensation. These results suggest that a transient rise in macromolecular crowding (proteins and RNAs), likely triggered by the relocation of macromolecules via nuclear envelope breakdown and also by a subsequent decrease in cell-volumes, contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation, shedding light on a new aspect of the condensation mechanism in living human cells.

Significance StatementMitotic chromosome condensation is an essential process to transmit replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells during cell division. To study the underlying physical principles of this process, we focused on macromolecular crowding/depletion force, which is a force that attracts large structures in crowded cell environments. Using newly developed special light microscopy, which can image the molecular density of cellular environments, we found that crowding around chromosomes increases during cell division. In vitro, higher concentrations of macromolecules condense chromatin and make it stiffer and more solid-like. Our results suggest that the rise in macromolecular crowding renders chromosomes more rigid, ensuring accurate chromosome transmission during cell division.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The association of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery is proposed to facilitate cell-type specific gene repression and influence cell fate decisions. However, the interplay between gene position and expression remains incompletely understood, in part because the proteins that position genomic loci at the nuclear periphery remain unidentified. Here, we used an Oligopaint-based HiDRO screen targeting ~1000 genes to discover novel regulators of nuclear architecture in Drosophila cells. We identified the heterochromatin-associated protein, Stonewall (Stwl), as a factor promoting perinuclear chromatin positioning. In female germline stem cells (GSCs), Stwl binds and positions chromatin loci, including GSC differentiation genes, at the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, Stwl-dependent perinuclear positioning is associated with transcriptional repression, highlighting a likely mechanism for the known role of Stwl in GSC maintenance and ovary homeostasis. Thus, our study identifies perinuclear anchors in Drosophila and demonstrates the importance of gene repression at the nuclear periphery for cell fate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Successful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify &#34;Myospreader&#34;, a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transition zone (TZ) regulates cilia composition and function. Canonical TZs with 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) are common but non-canonical TZs that vary from 9 MT symmetry also occur and arise through unknown mechanisms. Cilia on the quadrant inner labial type 2 (IL2Q) neurons of C. elegans have a specialized non-canonical TZ with fewer than 9 doublet MTs. We previously showed that non-canonical TZs in IL2Q cilia arise via MT loss and reorganization of canonical TZs. Here, we identify structural events and mechanisms that generate non-canonical TZs. Cell-specific alpha-tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 regulate IL2QTZ MT loss without affecting ciliary assembly. Our results reveal a role for the tubulin code in generating non-canonical TZs and contribute towards understanding ciliary functional specialization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory factor X 6 (RFX6) is indispensable for pancreatic endocrine development and differentiation. The RFX6 protein-truncating variant p.His293LeufsTer7 is significantly enriched in the Finnish population with almost 1:250 individuals as a carrier. Importantly, the FinnGen study indicates a high predisposition for heterozygous carriers to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes. To understand the role of this variant in {beta}-cell development and function, we generated allelic series of isogenic pluripotent stem cell models and directed them into pancreatic islet lineages (SC-islets). Expectedly, in-vitro models of the homozygous RFX6-/- variant failed to generate pancreatic endocrine cells, recapitulating the phenotype in Mitchell-Riley syndrome. Notably, heterozygous RFX6&#43;/- derived SC-islets showed reduced {beta}-cell maturation markers and calcium oscillations, resulting in defective insulin secretion, without affecting {beta}-cell number or insulin content. The reduced insulin secretion is sustained during in-vivo implantation studies, consistent with the susceptibility of the carriers to develop diabetes.

        <p class="abstract">Many biological structures take the form of fibres and filaments, and quantitative analysis of fibre organisation is important for understanding their functions in both normal physiological conditions and disease. In order to visualise these structures, fibres can be fluorescently labelled and imaged, with specialised image analysis methods available for quantifying the degree and strength of fibre alignment. Here we show that fluorescently labelled fibres can display polarised emission, with the strength of this effect varying depending on structure and fluorophore identity. This can bias automated analysis of fibre alignment and mask the true underlying structural organisation. We present a method for quantifying and correcting these polarisation effects without requiring polarisation resolved microscopy, and demonstrate its efficacy when applied to images of fluorescently labelled collagen gels, allowing for more reliable characterisation of fibre microarchitecture.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Macrophages measure the  eat-me signal IgG to identify targets for phagocytosis. We wondered if prior encounters with IgG influence macrophage appetite. IgG is recognized by the Fc Receptor. To temporally control Fc Receptor activation, we engineered an Fc Receptor that is activated by light-induced oligomerization of Cry2, triggering phagocytosis. Using this tool, we demonstrate that Fc Receptor activation primes macrophages to be more sensitive to IgG in future encounters. Macrophages that have previously experienced Fc Receptor activation eat more IgG-bound cancer cells. Increased phagocytosis occurs by two discrete mechanisms - a short- and long-term priming. Long term priming requires new protein synthesis and Erk activity. Short term priming does not require new protein synthesis and correlates with an increase in Fc Receptor mobility. Our work demonstrates that IgG primes macrophages for increased phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies may become more effective after initial priming doses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mild hemolysis of senescent erythrocytes occurs physiologically in the spleen, resulting in hemoglobin (Hb) release, whereas pathologic erythrocyte rupture characterizes several diseases. Iron recycling from Hb and Hb detoxification have been attributed to the sequestration of Hb-haptoglobin complexes by macrophages. However, we found the existence of additional efficient Hb clearance routes in mice. We identified liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) as the primary cells responsible for Hb sequestration, a process that involves macropinocytosis and operates independently of the Hb-haptoglobin receptor CD163. LSECs expressed heme oxygenase 1 and hepcidin-controlled ferroportin and were the most efficient cellular scavengers of Hb at doses below and above the haptoglobin binding capacity. Erythrocyte transfusion assays further demonstrated that while splenic red pulp macrophages are adept at erytrophagocytosis, liver Kupffer cells and LSECs mainly clear erythrocyte ghosts and Hb, respectively, transported from the spleen via the portal circulation. High-dose Hb injections in mice resulted in transient hepatic iron retention and early activation of the gene encoding heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) in LSECs. This response was associated with the transcriptional induction of the iron-sensing angiokine Bmp6, culminating in hepcidin-mediated transient serum hypoferremia. Injection of Hb and iron citrate elicited distinct transcriptional signatures in LSECs, and the Bmp6 induction was phenocopied by erythrocyte lysis upon phenylhydrazine. Collectively, we propose that LSECs provide a key mechanism for Hb clearance, a function that establishes the spleen-liver axis for physiological iron recycling from Hb and contributes to heme detoxification during hemolysis, coupled with the induction of the BMP6-hepcidin axis, ultimately restoring iron homeostasis.

Key points- LSECs engage macropinocytosis to efficiently scavenge free hemoglobin
- LSEC-mediated hemoglobin clearance participates in iron recycling from spleen-derived hemoglobin and contributes to its detoxification during hemolysis</p>
