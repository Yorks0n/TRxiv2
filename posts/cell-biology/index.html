D.; Sarinay Cenik, E.; Stroustrup, N.; Schmoller, K. M.; Cabianca, D. S.\nScore: 33.6, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.550032\nChromatin architecture is a fundamental mediator of genome function. Fasting is a major environmental cue across the animal kingdom. Yet, how it impacts on 3D genome organization is unknown. Here, we show that fasting induces a reversible and large-scale spatial reorganization of chromatin in C. elegans. This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of transcription by RNA Pol I, but not RNA Pol II nor Pol III, induces a similar 3D genome reorganization in fed animals, and prevents the restoration of the fed-state architecture upon restoring nutrients to fasted animals. Our work documents the first large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.\nApical annuli are specialised sites of post-invasion secretion of dense granules in Toxoplasma\nAuthors: Chelaghma, S.; Ke, H.; Barylyuk, K.; Krueger, T.; Koreny, L.; Waller, R. F.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550681\nApicomplexans are ubiquitous intracellular parasites of animals. These parasites use a programmed sequence of secretory events to find, invade, and then reengineer their host cells to enable parasite growth and proliferation. The secretory organelles micronemes and rhoptries mediate the first steps of invasion. Both secrete their contents through the apical complex which provides an apical opening in the parasites elaborate inner membrane complex (IMC) -- an extensive subpellicular system of flattened membrane cisternae and proteinaceous meshwork that otherwise limits access of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for material exchange with the cell exterior. After invasion, a second secretion programme drives host cell remodelling and occurs from dense granules. The site(s) of dense granule exocytosis, however, has been unknown. In Toxoplasma gondii, small subapical annular structures that are embedded in the IMC have been observed, but the role or significance of these apical annuli to plasma membrane function has also been unknown. Here, we determined that integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane occur specifically at these apical annular sites, that these proteins include SNARE proteins, and that the apical annuli are sites of vesicle fusion and exocytosis. Specifically, we show that dense granules require these structures for the secretion of their cargo proteins. When secretion is perturbed at the apical annuli, parasite growth is arrested. The apical annuli, therefore, represent a second structure in the IMC specialised for protein secretion, and reveal that in Toxoplasma there is a physical separation of the processes of pre- and post-invasion secretion that mediate host-parasite interactions.\nThe membrane-actin linkers ezrin, radixin, and moesin are dispensable for macrophage migration and cortex mechanics.\nAuthors: Verdys, P.; Rey Barroso, J.; Vermeil, J.; Bergert, M.; Sanchez, T.; Metais, A.; Mangeat, T.; Bellard, E.; Bigot, C.; Girard, J.-P.; Maridonneau-Parini, I.; Verollet, C.; Lagarrigue, F.; Diz-Munoz, A.; Heuvingh, J.; Piel, M.; Du Roure, O.; Le Cabec, V.; Carreno, S.; Poincloux, R.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550674\nThe cellular actin cortex provides crucial mechanical support and plays critical roles in numerous functions, including cell division and migration. The proteins of the ERM family, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are central to these processes by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the individual contributions of these three proteins to leukocyte migration, we generated single and triple ERM knock-out macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that even in the absence of ERMs, macrophages can still form the different actin structures promoting cell migration, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and ruffles. Furthermore we discovered that, unlike every other cell type previously investigated, the single or triple knock-out of ERMs does not affect macrophage migration in a large diversity of contexts. Finally, we demonstrated that the loss of ERMs in macrophages does not affect the mechanics of their actin cortex. These findings challenge the notion that ERMs are universally essential for cortex mechanics and cell migration and support the notion that the macrophage cortex may have diverged from that of other cells to allow for their adaptive cortical plasticity.\nA genome-wide single-cell 3D genome atlas of lung cancer progression\nAuthors: Liu, M.; Jin, S.; Agabiti, S. S.; Jensen, T. B.; Yang, T.; Radda, J. S. D.; Ruiz, C. F.; Baldissera, G.; Muzumdar, M. D.; Wang, S.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550157\nAlterations in three-dimensional (3D) genome structures are associated with cancer1-5. However, how genome folding evolves and diversifies during subclonal cancer progression in the native tissue environment remains unknown. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide chromatin tracing technology to directly visualize 3D genome folding in situ in a faithful Kras-driven mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)6, generating the first single-cell 3D genome atlas of any cancer. We discovered stereotypical 3D genome alterations during cancer development, including a striking structural bottleneck in preinvasive adenomas prior to progression to LUAD, indicating a stringent selection on the 3D genome early in cancer progression. We further showed that the 3D genome precisely encodes cancer states in single cells, despite considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Finally, evolutionary changes in 3D genome compartmentalization - partially regulated by polycomb group protein Rnf2 through its ubiquitin ligase-independent activity - reveal novel genetic drivers and suppressors of LUAD progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of mapping the single-cell cancer 3D genome and the potential to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers from 3D genomic architectures.\nIF1 controls UCP1-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics in brown adipocytes\nAuthors: Brunetta, H. S.; Jung, A. S.; Francisco, A.; Castilho, R. F.; Mori, M. A.; Bartelt, A.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550888\nIn thermogenic adipocytes, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is a key mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) by uncoupling the electron transport chain from FoF1-ATP synthase-mediated ATP production. While regulatory mechanisms of UCP1 are important for NST, it is unknown whether also the activity of ATP synthase is modulated during NST. Here, we show a critical role of Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, for brown adipocyte energy metabolism. In mice, IF1 protein content is diminished in brown adipose tissue of mice after 5 days of cold exposure. Additionally, the capacity of ATP synthase to generate mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through ATP hydrolysis (the so-called reverse mode) was higher in mitochondria isolated from cold-adapted mice compared to mice housed at room temperature. While silencing of IF1 in cultured brown adipocytes did not affect MMP, IF1 overexpression resulted in an inability of mitochondria to sustain MMP upon adrenergic stimulation. The effects of IF1 overexpression on MMP were blunted when UCP1 was silenced or when a mutant IF1, incapable of binding to ATP synthase, was used. In brown adipocytes, IF1 ablation was sufficient to increase mitochondrial lipid oxidation and the cellular dependency on glycolysis to produce ATP. Conversely, IF1 overexpression blunted mitochondrial respiration without causing energetic stress, leading to a quiescent-like phenotype in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that the cold-induced downregulation of IF1 facilitates the reverse mode of ATP synthase and enables proper bioenergetic adaptation of brown adipose tissue to effectively support NST.\npHusion: A robust and versatile toolset for automated detection and analysis of exocytosis\nAuthors: O'Shaughnessy, E. C.; Lam, M.; Ryken, S. E.; Wiesner, T.; Lukasik, K.; Zuchero, J. B.; Leterrier, C.; Adalsteinsson, D.; Gupton, S. L.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550499\nExocytosis is a fundamental process used by all eukaryotic cells to regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and facilitate cell-cell communication. To investigate the role exocytosis plays in neuronal morphogenesis, previously we developed computational tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the automatic detection and analysis of exocytic events (ADAE GUI) from fluorescence timelapse images. Though these tools have proven useful, we found that the code was brittle and not easily adapted to different experimental conditions. Here, we developed and validated a robust and versatile toolkit, we have named pHusion, for the analysis of exocytosis written in Image-Tank, a graphical programming language that combines image visualization and numerical methods. We tested this method using a variety of imaging modalities and pH-sensitive fluorophores, diverse cell types, and various exocytic markers to generate a flexible and intuitive package. Using pHusion, we show that VAMP3-mediated exocytosis occurs 30-times more frequently in melanoma cells compared with primary oligodendrocytes, that VAMP2-mediated fusion events in mature rat hippocampal neurons are much longer lasting than those in immature murine cortical neurons, and that clustering of exocytic events occurs across cell types.\nMiniBAR/KIAA0355 is a dual Rac and Rab effector required for ciliogenesis\nAuthors: Shaughnessy, R.; Serres, M.; Escot, S.; Hammich, H.; Cuvelier, F.; Salles, A.; Rocancourt, M.; Verdon, Q.; Gaffuri, A.-L.; Sourigues, Y.; Malherbe, G.; Velikovsky, L.; Chardon, F.; Tinevez, J.-Y.; Callebaut, I.; Formstecher, E.; Houdusse, A.; David, N.; Pylypenko, O.; Echard, A.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550339\nCilia protrude from the cell surface and play critical roles in in-tracellular signaling, environmental sensing and development. Actin-dependent contractility and intracellular trafficking are both required for ciliogenesis, but little is known about how these processes are coordinated. Here, we identified a Rac1-and Rab35-binding protein with a truncated BAR domain that we named MiniBAR (aka KIAA0355/GARRE) which plays a key role in ciliogenesis. MiniBAR colocalizes with Rac1 and Rab35 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles traffick-ing to the ciliary base and exhibits remarkable fast pulses at the ciliary membrane. MiniBAR depletion leads to short cilia resulting from abnormal Rac-GTP/Rho-GTP levels, increased acto-myosin-II-dependent contractility together with defective trafficking of IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia. MiniBAR-depleted zebrafish embryos display dysfunctional short cilia and hall-marks of ciliopathies including left-right asymmetry defects. Thus, MiniBAR is a unique dual Rac and Rab effector that con-trols both actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking for cili-ogenesis.\nGeneration of an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a healthy adult indigenous Nigerian participant\nAuthors: Muhammad, Z.; Brown, P. W.; Babazau, L.; Alkhamis, A. I.; Goni, B. W.; Nggada, H. A.; Mbaya, K. M.; Wray, S.; Marte, I. H.; Karch, C.; Serpell, L.; Maina, M. B.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550059\nGenetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.\nLeishmania major-induced alteration of host cellular and systemic copper homeostasis drives the fate of infection\nAuthors: Paul, R.; Chakrabarty, A.; Dey, S.; Samanta, S.; Pandey, R.; Maji, S.; Pezacki, A. T.; Chang, C. J.; Datta, R.; Gupta, A.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550461\nCopper plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction. We found that during Leishmania major infection, the parasite-harboring macrophage regulates its copper homeostasis pathway in a way to facilitate copper-mediated neutralization of the pathogen. Copper-ATPase ATP7A transports copper to amastigote-harboring phagolysosomes to induce stress on parasites. Leishmania in order to evade the copper stress, utilizes a variety of manipulative measures to lower the host-induced copper stress. It induces deglycosylation and degradation of host-ATP7A and downregulation of copper importer, CTR1 by cysteine oxidation. Additionally, Leishmania induces CTR1 endocytosis that arrests copper uptake. In mouse model of infection, we report an increase in systemic bioavailable copper in infected animals. Heart acts as the major organ for diverting its copper reserves to systemic circulation to fight-off infection by downregulating its CTR1. Our study explores reciprocal mechanism of manipulation of host copper homeostasis pathway by macrophage and Leishmania to gain respective advantages in host-pathogen interaction.\nThe Arf-GAP Age2 localizes to the late-Golgi via a conserved amphipathic helix\nAuthors: Manzer, K. M.; Fromme, J. C.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550229\nArf GTPases are central regulators of the Golgi complex, which serves as the nexus of membrane trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. Arf proteins recruit dozens of effectors to modify membranes, sort cargos, and create and tether transport vesicles, and are therefore essential for orchestrating Golgi trafficking. The regulation of Arf activity is controlled by the action of Arf-GEFs, which activate via nucleotide exchange, and Arf-GAPs, which inactivate via nucleotide hydrolysis. The localization dynamics of Arf GTPases and their Arf-GAPs during Golgi maturation have not been reported. Here we use the budding yeast model to examine the temporal localization of the Golgi Arf-GAPs. We also determine the mechanisms used by the Arf-GAP Age2 to localize to the Golgi. We find that the catalytic activity of Age2 and a conserved sequence in the unstructured C-terminal domain of Age2 are both required for Golgi localization. This sequence is predicted to form an amphipathic helix and mediates direct binding of Age2 to membranes in vitro. We also report the development of a probe for sensing active Arf1 in living cells and use this probe to characterize the temporal dynamics of Arf1 during Golgi maturation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chromatin architecture is a fundamental mediator of genome function. Fasting is a major environmental cue across the animal kingdom. Yet, how it impacts on 3D genome organization is unknown. Here, we show that fasting induces a reversible and large-scale spatial reorganization of chromatin in C. elegans. This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of transcription by RNA Pol I, but not RNA Pol II nor Pol III, induces a similar 3D genome reorganization in fed animals, and prevents the restoration of the fed-state architecture upon restoring nutrients to fasted animals.

Our work documents the first large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apicomplexans are ubiquitous intracellular parasites of animals. These parasites use a programmed sequence of secretory events to find, invade, and then reengineer their host cells to enable parasite growth and proliferation. The secretory organelles micronemes and rhoptries mediate the first steps of invasion. Both secrete their contents through the apical complex which provides an apical opening in the parasites elaborate inner membrane complex (IMC) -- an extensive subpellicular system of flattened membrane cisternae and proteinaceous meshwork that otherwise limits access of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for material exchange with the cell exterior. After invasion, a second secretion programme drives host cell remodelling and occurs from dense granules. The site(s) of dense granule exocytosis, however, has been unknown. In Toxoplasma gondii, small subapical annular structures that are embedded in the IMC have been observed, but the role or significance of these apical annuli to plasma membrane function has also been unknown. Here, we determined that integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane occur specifically at these apical annular sites, that these proteins include SNARE proteins, and that the apical annuli are sites of vesicle fusion and exocytosis. Specifically, we show that dense granules require these structures for the secretion of their cargo proteins. When secretion is perturbed at the apical annuli, parasite growth is arrested. The apical annuli, therefore, represent a second structure in the IMC specialised for protein secretion, and reveal that in Toxoplasma there is a physical separation of the processes of pre- and post-invasion secretion that mediate host-parasite interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cellular actin cortex provides crucial mechanical support and plays critical roles in numerous functions, including cell division and migration. The proteins of the ERM family, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are central to these processes by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the individual contributions of these three proteins to leukocyte migration, we generated single and triple ERM knock-out macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that even in the absence of ERMs, macrophages can still form the different actin structures promoting cell migration, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and ruffles. Furthermore we discovered that, unlike every other cell type previously investigated, the single or triple knock-out of ERMs does not affect macrophage migration in a large diversity of contexts. Finally, we demonstrated that the loss of ERMs in macrophages does not affect the mechanics of their actin cortex. These findings challenge the notion that ERMs are universally essential for cortex mechanics and cell migration and support the notion that the macrophage cortex may have diverged from that of other cells to allow for their adaptive cortical plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alterations in three-dimensional (3D) genome structures are associated with cancer1-5. However, how genome folding evolves and diversifies during subclonal cancer progression in the native tissue environment remains unknown. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide chromatin tracing technology to directly visualize 3D genome folding in situ in a faithful Kras-driven mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)6, generating the first single-cell 3D genome atlas of any cancer. We discovered stereotypical 3D genome alterations during cancer development, including a striking structural bottleneck in preinvasive adenomas prior to progression to LUAD, indicating a stringent selection on the 3D genome early in cancer progression. We further showed that the 3D genome precisely encodes cancer states in single cells, despite considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Finally, evolutionary changes in 3D genome compartmentalization - partially regulated by polycomb group protein Rnf2 through its ubiquitin ligase-independent activity - reveal novel genetic drivers and suppressors of LUAD progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of mapping the single-cell cancer 3D genome and the potential to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers from 3D genomic architectures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In thermogenic adipocytes, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is a key mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) by uncoupling the electron transport chain from FoF1-ATP synthase-mediated ATP production. While regulatory mechanisms of UCP1 are important for NST, it is unknown whether also the activity of ATP synthase is modulated during NST. Here, we show a critical role of Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, for brown adipocyte energy metabolism. In mice, IF1 protein content is diminished in brown adipose tissue of mice after 5 days of cold exposure. Additionally, the capacity of ATP synthase to generate mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through ATP hydrolysis (the so-called reverse mode) was higher in mitochondria isolated from cold-adapted mice compared to mice housed at room temperature. While silencing of IF1 in cultured brown adipocytes did not affect MMP, IF1 overexpression resulted in an inability of mitochondria to sustain MMP upon adrenergic stimulation. The effects of IF1 overexpression on MMP were blunted when UCP1 was silenced or when a mutant IF1, incapable of binding to ATP synthase, was used. In brown adipocytes, IF1 ablation was sufficient to increase mitochondrial lipid oxidation and the cellular dependency on glycolysis to produce ATP. Conversely, IF1 overexpression blunted mitochondrial respiration without causing energetic stress, leading to a quiescent-like phenotype in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that the cold-induced downregulation of IF1 facilitates the reverse mode of ATP synthase and enables proper bioenergetic adaptation of brown adipose tissue to effectively support NST.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exocytosis is a fundamental process used by all eukaryotic cells to regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and facilitate cell-cell communication. To investigate the role exocytosis plays in neuronal morphogenesis, previously we developed computational tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the automatic detection and analysis of exocytic events (ADAE GUI) from fluorescence timelapse images. Though these tools have proven useful, we found that the code was brittle and not easily adapted to different experimental conditions. Here, we developed and validated a robust and versatile toolkit, we have named pHusion, for the analysis of exocytosis written in Image-Tank, a graphical programming language that combines image visualization and numerical methods. We tested this method using a variety of imaging modalities and pH-sensitive fluorophores, diverse cell types, and various exocytic markers to generate a flexible and intuitive package. Using pHusion, we show that VAMP3-mediated exocytosis occurs 30-times more frequently in melanoma cells compared with primary oligodendrocytes, that VAMP2-mediated fusion events in mature rat hippocampal neurons are much longer lasting than those in immature murine cortical neurons, and that clustering of exocytic events occurs across cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cilia protrude from the cell surface and play critical roles in in-tracellular signaling, environmental sensing and development. Actin-dependent contractility and intracellular trafficking are both required for ciliogenesis, but little is known about how these processes are coordinated. Here, we identified a Rac1-and Rab35-binding protein with a truncated BAR domain that we named MiniBAR (aka KIAA0355/GARRE) which plays a key role in ciliogenesis. MiniBAR colocalizes with Rac1 and Rab35 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles traffick-ing to the ciliary base and exhibits remarkable fast pulses at the ciliary membrane. MiniBAR depletion leads to short cilia resulting from abnormal Rac-GTP/Rho-GTP levels, increased acto-myosin-II-dependent contractility together with defective trafficking of IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia. MiniBAR-depleted zebrafish embryos display dysfunctional short cilia and hall-marks of ciliopathies including left-right asymmetry defects. Thus, MiniBAR is a unique dual Rac and Rab effector that con-trols both actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking for cili-ogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetic backgrounds contribute to cellular phenotypes, drug responsiveness, and health outcomes. However, the majority of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are derived from individuals of European descent. Thus, there is a major, unmet need in the generation, characterisation, and distribution of iPSCs from diverse ancestries. To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community. Ongoing efforts focus on generating more lines from diverse indigenous populations towards creating a dedicated open-access African iPSC biobank.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Copper plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction. We found that during Leishmania major infection, the parasite-harboring macrophage regulates its copper homeostasis pathway in a way to facilitate copper-mediated neutralization of the pathogen. Copper-ATPase ATP7A transports copper to amastigote-harboring phagolysosomes to induce stress on parasites. Leishmania in order to evade the copper stress, utilizes a variety of manipulative measures to lower the host-induced copper stress. It induces deglycosylation and degradation of host-ATP7A and downregulation of copper importer, CTR1 by cysteine oxidation. Additionally, Leishmania induces CTR1 endocytosis that arrests copper uptake. In mouse model of infection, we report an increase in systemic bioavailable copper in infected animals. Heart acts as the major organ for diverting its copper reserves to systemic circulation to fight-off infection by downregulating its CTR1. Our study explores reciprocal mechanism of manipulation of host copper homeostasis pathway by macrophage and Leishmania to gain respective advantages in host-pathogen interaction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arf GTPases are central regulators of the Golgi complex, which serves as the nexus of membrane trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. Arf proteins recruit dozens of effectors to modify membranes, sort cargos, and create and tether transport vesicles, and are therefore essential for orchestrating Golgi trafficking. The regulation of Arf activity is controlled by the action of Arf-GEFs, which activate via nucleotide exchange, and Arf-GAPs, which inactivate via nucleotide hydrolysis. The localization dynamics of Arf GTPases and their Arf-GAPs during Golgi maturation have not been reported. Here we use the budding yeast model to examine the temporal localization of the Golgi Arf-GAPs. We also determine the mechanisms used by the Arf-GAP Age2 to localize to the Golgi. We find that the catalytic activity of Age2 and a conserved sequence in the unstructured C-terminal domain of Age2 are both required for Golgi localization. This sequence is predicted to form an amphipathic helix and mediates direct binding of Age2 to membranes in vitro. We also report the development of a probe for sensing active Arf1 in living cells and use this probe to characterize the temporal dynamics of Arf1 during Golgi maturation.</p>
