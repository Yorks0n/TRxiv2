The latter in particular has led to an exponential increase in interest in EVs as they are considered to be circulating packages containing potential biomarkers and are also a possible biological means to deliver drugs in a cell-specific manner. However, several challenges hamper straightforward analysis of EVs as they are generally low abundant and reside in complex biological matrices. These matrices typically contain protein concentrations that vastly exceed those of the EV proteome and contain particles in the same size and density range (e.g. protein aggregates and apolipoprotein particles). Therefore, extensive EV isolation and purification protocols are imperative and many have been developed, including (density) ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion and precipitation methods. Here, we describe an approach based on 300 kDa MWCO filtration, which allows processing of multiple samples in parallel within a reasonable timeframe and at moderate cost. We demonstrate that our strategy is capable of quantitatively retaining EV particles on filters, whilst allowing extensive washing with relatively high percentages of the mild detergent TWEEN-20. In addition, we provide evidence that the retained EVs can be recuperated from the filter for qualitative studies or can be directly lysed on the filter for the recovery of the EV protein cargo for proteome analysis. Applying this strategy on MCF7 conditioned medium using different percentages of serum, we observed dramatic changes in the EV proteome.\nPooled tagging and hydrophobic targeting of endogenous proteins for unbiased mapping of unfolded protein responses\nAuthors: Sansbury, S. E.; Serebrenik, Y. V.; Lapidot, T.; Burslem, G. M.; Shalem, O.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548611\nSystem-level understanding of proteome organization and function requires methods for direct visualization and manipulation of proteins at scale. We developed an approach enabled by high-throughput gene tagging for the generation and analysis of complex cell pools with endogenously tagged proteins. Proteins are tagged with HaloTag to enable visualization or direct perturbation. Fluorescent labeling followed by in situ sequencing and deep learning-based image analysis identifies the localization pattern of each tag, providing a birds-eye-view of cellular organization. Next, we use a hydrophobic HaloTag ligand to unfold tagged proteins, inducing spatially restricted proteotoxic stress that is read out by single cell RNA sequencing. By integrating optical and perturbation data, we map compartment-specific responses to protein misfolding, revealing inter-compartment organization and direct cross-talk, and assigning proteostasis functions to uncharacterized genes. Altogether, we present a powerful and efficient method for large-scale studies of proteome dynamics, function, and homeostasis.\nPooled endogenous protein tagging and recruitment for scalable discovery of effectors for induced proximity therapeutics\nAuthors: Serebrenik, Y. V.; Mani, D.; Maujean, T.; Burslem, G. M.; Shalem, O.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548759\nThe field of induced proximity therapeutics is in its ascendancy but is limited by a lack of scalable tools to systematically explore effector-target protein pairs in an unbiased manner. Here, we combined Scalable POoled Targeting with a LIgandable Tag at Endogenous Sites (SPOTLITES) for the high-throughput tagging of endogenous proteins, with generic small molecule-based protein recruitment to screen for novel proximity-based effectors. We apply this methodology in two orthogonal screens for targeted protein degradation: the first using fluorescence to monitor target protein levels directly, and the second using a cellular growth phenotype that depends on the degradation of an essential protein. Our screens revealed a multitude of potential new effector proteins for degradation and converged on members of the CTLH complex which we demonstrate potently induce degradation. Altogether, we introduce a platform for pooled induction of endogenous protein-protein interactions that can be used to expand our toolset of effector proteins for targeted protein degradation and other forms of induced proximity.\nNuclear envelope assembly relies on CHMP-7 in the absence of BAF-LEM-mediated hole closure\nAuthors: Barger, S. R.; Penfield, L.; Bahmanyar, S.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547980\nBarrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a DNA binding protein that crosslinks chromatin to assemble the nuclear envelope (NE) after mitosis. BAF also binds the Lap2b-Emerin-Man1 (LEM) domain family of NE proteins to repair interphase ruptures. The NE adaptors to ESCRTs, LEMD2-CHMP7, seal NE holes surrounding mitotic spindle microtubules (MTs), but whether NE hole closure in mitosis involves BAF-LEM binding is not known. Here, we analyze NE sealing after meiosis II in C. elegans oocytes to show that BAF-LEM binding and LEM-2LEMD2-CHMP-7 have distinct roles in hole closure around spindle MTs. LEM-2/EMR-1emerin function redundantly with BAF-1 to seal the NE. Compromising BAF-LEM binding revealed an additional role for EMR-1 in maintenance of the NE permeability barrier and an essential role for LEM-2-CHMP-7 in preventing NE assembly failure. The WH domain of LEM-2 recruits the majority of CHMP-7 to the NE in C. elegans and a LEM-2 -independent pool of CHMP-7, which is mostly enriched in the nucleoplasm, also contributes to NE stability. Thus, NE hole closure surrounding spindle MTs requires redundant mechanisms that safeguard against failure in NE assembly to support embryogenesis.\nPeripheral positioning of lysosomes supports melanoma aggressiveness\nAuthors: Jerabkova-Roda, K.; Mousson, A.; Peralta, M.; Karali, R.; Justiniano, H.; Lisii, L.-M.; Carl, P.; Asokan, N.; Busnelli, I.; Larnicol, A.; Lefebvre, O.; Lachuer, H.; Pichot, A.; Stemmelen, T.; Molitor, A.; Hirschler, A.; Delalande, F.; Sick, E.; Carapito, R.; Carapito, C.; Hyenne, V.; Schauer, K.; Ronde, P.; GOETZ, J. G.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548108\nEmerging evidences suggest that both function and position of organelles are pivotal for tumor cell dissemination. Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how the function of lysosomes is linked to their position and how this controls metastatic progression remains elusive. Here, we analyzed lysosome subcellular distribution in micropatterned patient-derived melanoma cells and found that lysosome spreading scales with their aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote invadopodia-based matrix degradation and invasion of melanoma cells which is directly linked to their lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. When controlling lysosomal positioning using chemo-genetical heterodimerization in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosomal secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosomal spreading in a zebrafish metastasis model significantly reduces invasive outgrowth. Our study provides a mechanistic demonstration that lysosomal positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis.\nOncostatin M is a Master Regulator of an Inflammatory Network in Dnmt3a-Mutant Hematopoietic Stem Cells\nAuthors: Schwartz, L. S.; Young, K. A.; Stearns, T. M.; Boyer, N.; Mujica, K. D.; Trowbridge, J. J.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548764\nAge-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identify Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to aging-driven Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We find that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young mice do not functionally respond to acute OSM stimulation with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoietic engraftment, or myeloid differentiation. However, young Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs transcriptionally upregulate an inflammatory cytokine network in response to acute OSM stimulation including genes encoding IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF. In addition, OSM-stimulated Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate the anti-inflammatory genes Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1, creating a negative feedback loop limiting sustained activation of the inflammatory network. In the context of an aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment with chronically elevated levels of OSM, Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate pro-inflammatory genes but do not upregulate Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1. Together, our work suggests that chronic inflammation with aging exhausts the regulatory mechanisms in young CH-mutant HSCs that resolve inflammatory states, and that OSM is a master regulator of an inflammatory network that contributes to age-associated CH.\nSelf-extinguishing relay waves enable homeostaticcontrol of human neutrophil swarming\nAuthors: Strickland, J.; Pan, D.; Godfrey, C.; Kim, J. S.; Hopke, A.; Degrange, M.; Villavicencio, B.; Mansour, M. K.; Zerbe, C. S.; Irimia, D.; Amir, A.; Weiner, O. D.\nScore: 570.9, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546744\nNeutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.\nmRNA condensation fluidizes the cytoplasm\nAuthors: Xie, Y.; Liu, T.; Gresham, D.; Holt, L. J.\nScore: 69.0, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.542963\nThe intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.\nA role for Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at the ER-endosome contact site in ESCRT-mediated sorting\nAuthors: Suzuki, S.; West, M.; Zhang, Y.; Fan, J. S.; Roberts, R. T.; Odorizzi, G.; Emr, S. D.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547997\nEndosomes are specialized organelles that function in the secretory and endocytic protein sorting pathways. Endocytosed cell surface receptors and transporters destined for lysosomal degradation are sorted into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) at endosomes by Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. The endosomes (multivesicular bodies, MVBs) then fuse with the lysosome. During endosomal maturation, the number of ILVs increases, but the size of endosomes does not decrease despite consumption of the limiting membrane during ILV formation. Vesicle-mediated trafficking is thought to provide lipids to support MVB biogenesis. However, we have uncovered an unexpected contribution of a large bridge-like lipid transfer protein, Vps13, in this process. Here, we reveal that Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at ER-endosome contact sites is required for the ESCRT pathway. We propose that Vps13 may play a critical role in supplying lipids to the endosome, ensuring continuous ESCRT-mediated sorting during MVB formation.\nMulti-tissue proteomics identifies a link between satellite DNA organization and transgenerational transposon repression in Drosophila\nAuthors: Chavan, A.; Skrutl, L.; Uliana, F.; Pfister, M.; Burke, D. F.; Braendle, F.; Beltrao, P.; Jagannathan, M.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548599\nThe pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes primarily consists of abundant non-coding repeats known as satellite DNA, which promote accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. During interphase, sequence-specific satellite DNA-binding proteins cluster repeats from multiple chromosomes into foci known as chromocenters, which function to encapsulate the entire genome in a single nucleus. Despite the pivotal role of satellite DNA-binding proteins and chromocenters in cellular function, the proteins associated with these repetitive sequences remains incompletely characterized. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in Drosophila embryos, ovaries and testes using two satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits. We identify nearly 500 interactions, including known heterochromatin-associated proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters. Among these interactions, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with chromocenters. Strikingly, we reveal that proper satellite DNA clustering plays a role in transgenerational transposon repression, such that mothers with disrupted chromocenters give rise to progeny that exhibit transposon de-repression, germ cell loss and gonadal atrophy. Overall, our study highlights a novel link between satellite DNA repeats and transposon repression and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of satellite DNA function across tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A.Extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-delimited nanovesicles that are secreted by cells into the extracellular environment, are gaining substantial interest due to their involvement in cellular homeostasis and their contribution to disease pathology. The latter in particular has led to an exponential increase in interest in EVs as they are considered to be circulating packages containing potential biomarkers and are also a possible biological means to deliver drugs in a cell-specific manner. However, several challenges hamper straightforward analysis of EVs as they are generally low abundant and reside in complex biological matrices. These matrices typically contain protein concentrations that vastly exceed those of the EV proteome and contain particles in the same size and density range (e.g. protein aggregates and apolipoprotein particles). Therefore, extensive EV isolation and purification protocols are imperative and many have been developed, including (density) ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion and precipitation methods. Here, we describe an approach based on 300 kDa MWCO filtration, which allows processing of multiple samples in parallel within a reasonable timeframe and at moderate cost. We demonstrate that our strategy is capable of quantitatively retaining EV particles on filters, whilst allowing extensive washing with relatively high percentages of the mild detergent TWEEN-20. In addition, we provide evidence that the retained EVs can be recuperated from the filter for qualitative studies or can be directly lysed on the filter for the recovery of the EV protein cargo for proteome analysis. Applying this strategy on MCF7 conditioned medium using different percentages of serum, we observed dramatic changes in the EV proteome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">System-level understanding of proteome organization and function requires methods for direct visualization and manipulation of proteins at scale. We developed an approach enabled by high-throughput gene tagging for the generation and analysis of complex cell pools with endogenously tagged proteins. Proteins are tagged with HaloTag to enable visualization or direct perturbation. Fluorescent labeling followed by in situ sequencing and deep learning-based image analysis identifies the localization pattern of each tag, providing a birds-eye-view of cellular organization. Next, we use a hydrophobic HaloTag ligand to unfold tagged proteins, inducing spatially restricted proteotoxic stress that is read out by single cell RNA sequencing. By integrating optical and perturbation data, we map compartment-specific responses to protein misfolding, revealing inter-compartment organization and direct cross-talk, and assigning proteostasis functions to uncharacterized genes. Altogether, we present a powerful and efficient method for large-scale studies of proteome dynamics, function, and homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The field of induced proximity therapeutics is in its ascendancy but is limited by a lack of scalable tools to systematically explore effector-target protein pairs in an unbiased manner. Here, we combined Scalable POoled Targeting with a LIgandable Tag at Endogenous Sites (SPOTLITES) for the high-throughput tagging of endogenous proteins, with generic small molecule-based protein recruitment to screen for novel proximity-based effectors. We apply this methodology in two orthogonal screens for targeted protein degradation: the first using fluorescence to monitor target protein levels directly, and the second using a cellular growth phenotype that depends on the degradation of an essential protein. Our screens revealed a multitude of potential new effector proteins for degradation and converged on members of the CTLH complex which we demonstrate potently induce degradation. Altogether, we introduce a platform for pooled induction of endogenous protein-protein interactions that can be used to expand our toolset of effector proteins for targeted protein degradation and other forms of induced proximity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a DNA binding protein that crosslinks chromatin to assemble the nuclear envelope (NE) after mitosis. BAF also binds the Lap2b-Emerin-Man1 (LEM) domain family of NE proteins to repair interphase ruptures. The NE adaptors to ESCRTs, LEMD2-CHMP7, seal NE holes surrounding mitotic spindle microtubules (MTs), but whether NE hole closure in mitosis involves BAF-LEM binding is not known. Here, we analyze NE sealing after meiosis II in C. elegans oocytes to show that BAF-LEM binding and LEM-2LEMD2-CHMP-7 have distinct roles in hole closure around spindle MTs. LEM-2/EMR-1emerin function redundantly with BAF-1 to seal the NE. Compromising BAF-LEM binding revealed an additional role for EMR-1 in maintenance of the NE permeability barrier and an essential role for LEM-2-CHMP-7 in preventing NE assembly failure. The WH domain of LEM-2 recruits the majority of CHMP-7 to the NE in C. elegans and a LEM-2 -independent pool of CHMP-7, which is mostly enriched in the nucleoplasm, also contributes to NE stability. Thus, NE hole closure surrounding spindle MTs requires redundant mechanisms that safeguard against failure in NE assembly to support embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emerging evidences suggest that both function and position of organelles are pivotal for tumor cell dissemination. Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how the function of lysosomes is linked to their position and how this controls metastatic progression remains elusive. Here, we analyzed lysosome subcellular distribution in micropatterned patient-derived melanoma cells and found that lysosome spreading scales with their aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote invadopodia-based matrix degradation and invasion of melanoma cells which is directly linked to their lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. When controlling lysosomal positioning using chemo-genetical heterodimerization in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosomal secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosomal spreading in a zebrafish metastasis model significantly reduces invasive outgrowth. Our study provides a mechanistic demonstration that lysosomal positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identify Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to aging-driven Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We find that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young mice do not functionally respond to acute OSM stimulation with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoietic engraftment, or myeloid differentiation. However, young Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs transcriptionally upregulate an inflammatory cytokine network in response to acute OSM stimulation including genes encoding IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF. In addition, OSM-stimulated Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate the anti-inflammatory genes Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1, creating a negative feedback loop limiting sustained activation of the inflammatory network. In the context of an aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment with chronically elevated levels of OSM, Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate pro-inflammatory genes but do not upregulate Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1. Together, our work suggests that chronic inflammation with aging exhausts the regulatory mechanisms in young CH-mutant HSCs that resolve inflammatory states, and that OSM is a master regulator of an inflammatory network that contributes to age-associated CH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intracellular environment is packed with macromolecules of mesoscale size, and this crowded milieu significantly influences cell physiology. When exposed to stress, mRNAs released after translational arrest condense with RNA binding proteins, resulting in the formation of membraneless RNA protein (RNP) condensates known as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs). However, the impact of the assembly of these condensates on the biophysical properties of the crowded cytoplasmic environment remains unclear. Here, we find that upon exposure to stress, polysome collapse and condensation of mRNAs increases mesoscale particle diffusivity in the cytoplasm. Increased mesoscale diffusivity is required for the efficient formation of Q-bodies, membraneless organelles that coordinate degradation of misfolded peptides that accumulate during stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that polysome collapse and stress granule formation has a similar effect in mammalian cells, fluidizing the cytoplasm at the mesoscale. We find that synthetic, light-induced RNA condensation is sufficient to fluidize the cytoplasm, demonstrating a causal effect of RNA condensation. Together, our work reveals a new functional role for stress-induced translation inhibition and formation of RNP condensates in modulating the physical properties of the cytoplasm to effectively respond to stressful conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endosomes are specialized organelles that function in the secretory and endocytic protein sorting pathways. Endocytosed cell surface receptors and transporters destined for lysosomal degradation are sorted into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) at endosomes by Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. The endosomes (multivesicular bodies, MVBs) then fuse with the lysosome. During endosomal maturation, the number of ILVs increases, but the size of endosomes does not decrease despite consumption of the limiting membrane during ILV formation. Vesicle-mediated trafficking is thought to provide lipids to support MVB biogenesis. However, we have uncovered an unexpected contribution of a large bridge-like lipid transfer protein, Vps13, in this process. Here, we reveal that Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at ER-endosome contact sites is required for the ESCRT pathway. We propose that Vps13 may play a critical role in supplying lipids to the endosome, ensuring continuous ESCRT-mediated sorting during MVB formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes primarily consists of abundant non-coding repeats known as satellite DNA, which promote accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. During interphase, sequence-specific satellite DNA-binding proteins cluster repeats from multiple chromosomes into foci known as chromocenters, which function to encapsulate the entire genome in a single nucleus. Despite the pivotal role of satellite DNA-binding proteins and chromocenters in cellular function, the proteins associated with these repetitive sequences remains incompletely characterized. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in Drosophila embryos, ovaries and testes using two satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits. We identify nearly 500 interactions, including known heterochromatin-associated proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters. Among these interactions, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with chromocenters. Strikingly, we reveal that proper satellite DNA clustering plays a role in transgenerational transposon repression, such that mothers with disrupted chromocenters give rise to progeny that exhibit transposon de-repression, germ cell loss and gonadal atrophy. Overall, our study highlights a novel link between satellite DNA repeats and transposon repression and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of satellite DNA function across tissues.</p>
