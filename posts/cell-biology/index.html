We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.\nA nuclear architecture screen in Drosophila identifies Stonewall as a link between chromatin position at the nuclear periphery and germline stem cell fate\nAuthors: Chavan, A.; Isenhart, R.; Nguyen, S. C.; Kotb, N.; Harke, J.; Sintsova, A.; Ulukaya, G.; Uliana, F.; Ashiono, C.; Kutay, U.; Pegoraro, G.; Rangan, P.; Joyce, E. F.; Jagannathan, M.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567611\nThe association of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery is proposed to facilitate cell-type specific gene repression and influence cell fate decisions. However, the interplay between gene position and expression remains incompletely understood, in part because the proteins that position genomic loci at the nuclear periphery remain unidentified. Here, we used an Oligopaint-based HiDRO screen targeting [~]1000 genes to discover novel regulators of nuclear architecture in Drosophila cells. We identified the heterochromatin-associated protein, Stonewall (Stwl), as a factor promoting perinuclear chromatin positioning. In female germline stem cells (GSCs), Stwl binds and positions chromatin loci, including GSC differentiation genes, at the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, Stwl-dependent perinuclear positioning is associated with transcriptional repression, highlighting a likely mechanism for Stwls known role in GSC maintenance and ovary homeostasis. Thus, our study identifies perinuclear anchors in Drosophila and demonstrates the importance of gene repression at the nuclear periphery for cell fate.\nMyospreader improves gene editing in skeletal muscle by myonuclear propagation\nAuthors: Poukalov, K.; Valero, M. C.; Muscato, D.; Adams, L.; Chun, H.; Lee, Y. i. T.; Andrade, N.; Zeier, Z.; Sweeney, H. L.; Wang, E. T.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565807\nSuccessful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify \"Myospreader\", a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.\nCell-specific alpha-tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 generate a non-canonical transition zone\nAuthors: Akella, J. S.; Silva, M. S.; Nguyen, K. C. Q.; Hall, D. H.; Barr, M. M.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567340\nThe transition zone (TZ) regulates cilia composition and function. Canonical TZs with 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) are common but non-canonical TZs that vary from 9 MT symmetry also occur and arise through unknown mechanisms. Cilia on the quadrant inner labial type 2 (IL2Q) neurons of C. elegans have a specialized non-canonical TZ with fewer than 9 doublet MTs. We previously showed that non-canonical TZs in IL2Q cilia arise via MT loss and reorganization of canonical TZs. Here, we identify structural events and mechanisms that generate non-canonical TZs. Cell-specific -tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 regulate IL2QTZ MT loss without affecting ciliary assembly. Our results reveal a role for the tubulin code in generating non-canonical TZs and contribute towards understanding ciliary functional specialization. Author summaryCiliary microtubules are exquisitely diverse in arrangements and composition. Studies on how ciliary ultrastructural diversity is generated are essential to our understanding of cilia function in diverse healthy and pathological contexts. Despite its clinical relevance, the ultrastructural diversity of the transition zone and its microtubules remains understudied. Here, we uncover mechanisms contributing to generating ultrastructural diversity in the transition zone and in cilia. A subset of sensory cilia in C. elegans contain a non-canonical transition zone with 7 and fewer doublet microtubules. We previously showed that this distinct transition zone is generated through microtubule loss in a canonical transition zone with 9 doublet microtubules, a process that occurs asynchronously during animal development. Here, we identify roles for the tubulin code and for an IFT cargo in generating a distinct transition zone. Sculpting of the distinct transition zone occurs in fully assembled cilia and transition zones and is independent of general ciliogenesis mechanisms. Our results demonstrate how specialized transition zones can be generated from canonical transition zones and provide insight into mechanisms of ciliary ultrastructural diversity and post-ciliogenesis restructuring. Such mechanisms hold the key to understanding ciliary function and to restoration of function in ciliopathies with ciliary ultrastructural defects.\nRFX6 haploinsufficiency predisposes to diabetes through impaired beta cell functionality\nAuthors: Ibrahim, H.; Balboa, D.; Saarimäki-Vire, J.; Montaser, H.; Dyachok, O.; Lund, P.-E.; Omar-Hmeadi, M.; Kvist, J.; Dwivedi, O. P.; Lithovius, V.; Barsby, T.; Chandra, V.; Eurola, S.; Ustinov, J.; Tuomi, T.; Miettinen, P. J.; Barg, S.; Tengholm, A.; Otonkoski, T.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567202\nRegulatory factor X 6 (RFX6) is indispensable for pancreatic endocrine development and differentiation. The RFX6 protein-truncating variant p.His293LeufsTer7 is significantly enriched in the Finnish population with almost 1:250 individuals as a carrier. Importantly, the FinnGen study indicates a high predisposition for heterozygous carriers to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes. To understand the role of this variant in {beta}-cell development and function, we generated allelic series of isogenic pluripotent stem cell models and directed them into pancreatic islet lineages (SC-islets). Expectedly, in-vitro models of the homozygous RFX6-/- variant failed to generate pancreatic endocrine cells, recapitulating the phenotype in Mitchell-Riley syndrome. Notably, heterozygous RFX6+/- derived SC-islets showed reduced {beta}-cell maturation markers and calcium oscillations, resulting in defective insulin secretion, without affecting {beta}-cell number or insulin content. The reduced insulin secretion is sustained during in-vivo implantation studies, consistent with the susceptibility of the carriers to develop diabetes. TeaserModeling RFX6-assocciated neonatal and type-2 diabetes using allelic series stem cell-derived islets in-vitro and in-vivo.\nIlluminating the complete β-cell mass of the human pancreas - signifying a new view on the islets of Langerhans\nAuthors: Lehrstrand, J.; Davies, W. L.; Hahn, M.; Korsgren, O.; Alanentalo, T.; Ahlgren, U.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.566244\nPancreatic islets of Langerhans play a pivotal role in regulating blood glucose homeostasis, but critical information regarding their mass, distribution and composition is lacking within a whole organ context. Here, a new 3D imaging pipeline was applied to generate a first complete account of the insulin-producing islets throughout the human pancreas at a microscopic resolution and within a maintained spatial 3D context. These data show that human islets are far more heterogenous than previously accounted for with regards to their size distribution and cellular make up. By deep tissue 3D imaging, this in-depth study demonstrates that 50% of the human insulin-expressing islets are virtually devoid of glucagon-producing a-cells, an observation with significant implications for both experimental and clinical research.

A.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566609\nNeuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are evolutionarily ancient, specialized contacts between neurons and muscles. Axons and NMJs must endure mechanical strain through a lifetime of muscle contraction, making them vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. However, cellular strategies for mitigating this mechanical stress remain unknown. In this study, we used Drosophila larval NMJs to investigate the role of actin and myosin (actomyosin)-mediated contractility in generating and responding to cellular forces at the neuron-muscle interface. We identified a new long-lived, low-turnover presynaptic actin core traversing the NMJ, which partly co-localizes with non-muscle myosin II (NMII). Neuronal RNAi of NMII induced disorganization of this core, suggesting that this structure might have contractile properties. Interestingly, neuronal RNAi of NMII also decreased NMII levels in the postsynaptic muscle proximal to neurons, suggesting that neuronal actomyosin rearrangements propagate their effects trans-synaptically. We also observed reduced Integrin levels upon NMII knockdown, indicating that neuronal actomyosin disruption triggers rearrangements of Integrin-mediated connections between neurons and surrounding muscle tissue. In summary, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized presynaptic actomyosin subpopulation that upholds the neuronal mechanical continuum, transmits signals to adjacent muscle tissue, and collaborates with Integrin receptors to govern the mechanobiology of the neuromuscular junction.\nA mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit integrates genome integrity with inflammation\nAuthors: Miller, K. N.; Li, B.; Pierce-Hoffman, H. R.; Lei, X.; Havas, A. P.; Patel, S.; Cano Macip, C.; Victorelli, S. G.; Woo, S.-H.; Lagnado, A. B.; Liu, T.; Dasgupta, N.; Lyu, J.; Altman, Y.; Porritt, R. A.; Garcia, G.; Mogler, C.; Dou, Z.; Chen, C.; Passos, J. F.; Adams, P. D.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567963\nGenomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.\nGenomic and phenotypic stability of fusion-driven pediatric Ewing sarcoma cell lines\nAuthors: Kasan, M.; Siebenlist, J.; Sill, M.; Oellinger, R.; de Alava, E.; Surdez, D.; Dirksen, U.; Oehme, I.; Scotlandi, K.; Delattre, O.; Mueller-Nurasyid, M.; Rad, R.; Strauch, K.; Gruenewald, T. G. P.; Cidre-Aranaz, F.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567802\nHuman cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. This highlighted how despite human cell line models being powerful tools for cancer research, the findings derived from their use may present limitations in terms of reproducibility. However, to what extent these conclusions can be generalized to the majority of cancer cell lines remained unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines driven by a chimeric oncogenic transcription factor (COTF), such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), were genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated (adult) carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains in direct comparison to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture showed that COTF-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. The analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture conditions revealed that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic may be observed among COTF-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity.\nMulti-functional ARF1 compartments serve as a hub for short-range cargo transfer to endosomes\nAuthors: Stockhammer, A.; Adarska, P.; Natalia, V.; Heuhsen, A.; Klemt, A.; Harel, S.; Rodilla-Ramirez, C.; Spalt, C.; Oezsoy, E.; Leupold, P.; Grindel, A.; Fox, E.; Mejedo, J. O.; Puchkov, D.; Haucke, V.; Bottanelli, F.\nScore: 28.6, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564143\nCellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on organelle dynamics allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral replication. We combine label-free holo-tomographic microscopy (HTM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to visualize and quantify the subcellular changes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We study the dynamics of shape, position and dry mass of nucleoli, nuclei, lipid droplets (LD) and mitochondria within hundreds of single cells from early infection to syncytia formation and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection enlarges nucleoli, perturbs LD, changes mitochondrial shape and dry mass, and separates LD from mitochondria. We then used Bayesian statistics on organelle dry mass states to define organelle cross-regulation (OCR) networks and report modifications of OCR that are triggered by infection and syncytia formation. Our work highlights the subcellular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides a new AI-enhanced, label-free methodology to study in real-time the dynamics of cell populations and their content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The association of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery is proposed to facilitate cell-type specific gene repression and influence cell fate decisions. However, the interplay between gene position and expression remains incompletely understood, in part because the proteins that position genomic loci at the nuclear periphery remain unidentified. Here, we used an Oligopaint-based HiDRO screen targeting [~]1000 genes to discover novel regulators of nuclear architecture in Drosophila cells. We identified the heterochromatin-associated protein, Stonewall (Stwl), as a factor promoting perinuclear chromatin positioning. In female germline stem cells (GSCs), Stwl binds and positions chromatin loci, including GSC differentiation genes, at the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, Stwl-dependent perinuclear positioning is associated with transcriptional repression, highlighting a likely mechanism for Stwls known role in GSC maintenance and ovary homeostasis. Thus, our study identifies perinuclear anchors in Drosophila and demonstrates the importance of gene repression at the nuclear periphery for cell fate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Successful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify &#34;Myospreader&#34;, a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transition zone (TZ) regulates cilia composition and function. Canonical TZs with 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) are common but non-canonical TZs that vary from 9 MT symmetry also occur and arise through unknown mechanisms. Cilia on the quadrant inner labial type 2 (IL2Q) neurons of C. elegans have a specialized non-canonical TZ with fewer than 9 doublet MTs. We previously showed that non-canonical TZs in IL2Q cilia arise via MT loss and reorganization of canonical TZs. Here, we identify structural events and mechanisms that generate non-canonical TZs. Cell-specific -tubulin TBA-6 and pan-ciliary IFT cargo RAB-28 regulate IL2QTZ MT loss without affecting ciliary assembly. Our results reveal a role for the tubulin code in generating non-canonical TZs and contribute towards understanding ciliary functional specialization.

Author summaryCiliary microtubules are exquisitely diverse in arrangements and composition. Studies on how ciliary ultrastructural diversity is generated are essential to our understanding of cilia function in diverse healthy and pathological contexts. Despite its clinical relevance, the ultrastructural diversity of the transition zone and its microtubules remains understudied. Here, we uncover mechanisms contributing to generating ultrastructural diversity in the transition zone and in cilia. A subset of sensory cilia in C. elegans contain a non-canonical transition zone with 7 and fewer doublet microtubules. We previously showed that this distinct transition zone is generated through microtubule loss in a canonical transition zone with 9 doublet microtubules, a process that occurs asynchronously during animal development. Here, we identify roles for the tubulin code and for an IFT cargo in generating a distinct transition zone. Sculpting of the distinct transition zone occurs in fully assembled cilia and transition zones and is independent of general ciliogenesis mechanisms. Our results demonstrate how specialized transition zones can be generated from canonical transition zones and provide insight into mechanisms of ciliary ultrastructural diversity and post-ciliogenesis restructuring. Such mechanisms hold the key to understanding ciliary function and to restoration of function in ciliopathies with ciliary ultrastructural defects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory factor X 6 (RFX6) is indispensable for pancreatic endocrine development and differentiation. The RFX6 protein-truncating variant p.His293LeufsTer7 is significantly enriched in the Finnish population with almost 1:250 individuals as a carrier. Importantly, the FinnGen study indicates a high predisposition for heterozygous carriers to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes. To understand the role of this variant in {beta}-cell development and function, we generated allelic series of isogenic pluripotent stem cell models and directed them into pancreatic islet lineages (SC-islets). Expectedly, in-vitro models of the homozygous RFX6-/- variant failed to generate pancreatic endocrine cells, recapitulating the phenotype in Mitchell-Riley syndrome. Notably, heterozygous RFX6&#43;/- derived SC-islets showed reduced {beta}-cell maturation markers and calcium oscillations, resulting in defective insulin secretion, without affecting {beta}-cell number or insulin content. The reduced insulin secretion is sustained during in-vivo implantation studies, consistent with the susceptibility of the carriers to develop diabetes.

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic islets of Langerhans play a pivotal role in regulating blood glucose homeostasis, but critical information regarding their mass, distribution and composition is lacking within a whole organ context. Here, a new 3D imaging pipeline was applied to generate a first complete account of the insulin-producing islets throughout the human pancreas at a microscopic resolution and within a maintained spatial 3D context. These data show that human islets are far more heterogenous than previously accounted for with regards to their size distribution and cellular make up. By deep tissue 3D imaging, this in-depth study demonstrates that 50% of the human insulin-expressing islets are virtually devoid of glucagon-producing a-cells, an observation with significant implications for both experimental and clinical research.

        <p class="abstract">Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are evolutionarily ancient, specialized contacts between neurons and muscles. Axons and NMJs must endure mechanical strain through a lifetime of muscle contraction, making them vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. However, cellular strategies for mitigating this mechanical stress remain unknown. In this study, we used Drosophila larval NMJs to investigate the role of actin and myosin (actomyosin)-mediated contractility in generating and responding to cellular forces at the neuron-muscle interface. We identified a new long-lived, low-turnover presynaptic actin core traversing the NMJ, which partly co-localizes with non-muscle myosin II (NMII). Neuronal RNAi of NMII induced disorganization of this core, suggesting that this structure might have contractile properties. Interestingly, neuronal RNAi of NMII also decreased NMII levels in the postsynaptic muscle proximal to neurons, suggesting that neuronal actomyosin rearrangements propagate their effects trans-synaptically. We also observed reduced Integrin levels upon NMII knockdown, indicating that neuronal actomyosin disruption triggers rearrangements of Integrin-mediated connections between neurons and surrounding muscle tissue. In summary, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized presynaptic actomyosin subpopulation that upholds the neuronal mechanical continuum, transmits signals to adjacent muscle tissue, and collaborates with Integrin receptors to govern the mechanobiology of the neuromuscular junction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic instability and inflammation are distinct hallmarks of aging, but the connection between them is poorly understood. Understanding their interrelationship will help unravel new mechanisms and therapeutic targets of aging and age-associated diseases. Here we report a novel mechanism directly linking genomic instability and inflammation in senescent cells, through a mitochondria-regulated molecular circuit that connects the p53 tumor suppressor and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), a driver of inflammation through the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation or inactivation of p53 by genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that p53 suppresses CCF accumulation and the downstream inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest. p53 activation suppressed CCF formation by promoting DNA repair, reflected in maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, as shown by single cell genome resequencing. Activation of p53 by pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 in old mice decreased features of SASP in liver, indicating a senomorphic role in vivo. Remarkably, mitochondria in senescent cells suppressed p53 activity by promoting CCF formation and thereby restricting ATM-dependent nuclear DNA damage signaling. These data provide evidence for a mitochondria-regulated p53-CCF circuit in senescent cells that controls DNA repair, genome integrity and inflammatory SASP, and is a potential target for senomorphic healthy aging interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. This highlighted how despite human cell line models being powerful tools for cancer research, the findings derived from their use may present limitations in terms of reproducibility. However, to what extent these conclusions can be generalized to the majority of cancer cell lines remained unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines driven by a chimeric oncogenic transcription factor (COTF), such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), were genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated (adult) carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains in direct comparison to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture showed that COTF-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. The analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture conditions revealed that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic may be observed among COTF-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular membrane homeostasis is maintained via a tightly regulated membrane and cargo flow between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways. Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular sorting machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs, and coordinate Golgi export as well as endocytic recycling. Rather than long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe transient interactions of ARF1 compartments and recycling endosomes, with the sorting machinery localizing at the interface between the two membranes. Our findings suggest that endocytic and secretory cargo transfer from ARF1 compartments to endosomes may be mediated by a kiss-and-run mechanism rather than by fusion of transport vesicles.</p>
