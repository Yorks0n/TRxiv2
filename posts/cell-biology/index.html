The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5 end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5 end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on removal of the poly(A) tail. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 fully rescues RNA length and suppresses stress-induced decay. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.\nParaoxonase-like APMAP maintains endoplasmic reticulum-associated lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis\nAuthors: Paul, B.; Merta, H.; Ugrankar-Banerjee, R.; Hensley, M.; Tran, S.; Dias do Vale, G.; McDonald, J. G.; Farber, S. A.; Henne, W. M.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577049\nOxidative stress perturbs lipid homeostasis and contributes to metabolic diseases. Though ignored compared to mitochondrial oxidation, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) generates reactive oxygen species requiring antioxidant quality control. Using multi-organismal profiling featuring Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells, here we characterize the paraoxonase-like APMAP as an ER-localized protein that promotes redox and lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein maturation. APMAP-depleted mammalian cells exhibit defective ER morphology, elevated ER and oxidative stress, lipid droplet accumulation, and perturbed ApoB-lipoprotein homeostasis. Critically, APMAP loss is rescued with chemical antioxidant NAC. Organismal APMAP depletion in Drosophila perturbs fat and lipoprotein homeostasis, and zebrafish display increased vascular ApoB-containing lipoproteins, particles that are atherogenic in mammals. Lipidomics reveals altered polyunsaturated phospholipids and increased ceramides upon APMAP loss, which perturbs ApoB-lipoprotein maturation. These ApoB-associated defects are rescued by inhibiting ceramide synthesis. Collectively, we propose APMAP is an ER-localized antioxidant that promotes lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis. Key findings summaryO_LIAPMAP localizes primarily to the ER network in human cells and Drosophila fat body tissue, and is a type II integral membrane protein C_LIO_LILoss of APMAP or Drosophila APMAP (dAPMAP) causes ER membrane expansion, elevates CHOP-associated ER stress, promotes LD accumulation, and alters ApoB-lipoprotein secretion C_LIO_LIAPMAP-depleted cells and dAPMAP-depleted Drosophila fat tissue exhibit defective redox homeostasis; phenotypes associated with APMAP loss are rescued by antioxidant NAC C_LIO_LIZebrafish-based LipoGlo reporter reveals that loss of apmap in zebrafish causes increased vascular ApoB-containing lipoproteins C_LIO_LILipidomic profiling indicates that APMAP loss reduces PUFA-phospholipids and elevates intracellular ceramides, which perturbs ApoB maturation C_LI\nA Novel Therapeutic Approach using CXCR3 Blockade to Treat Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-mediated Myocarditis\nAuthors: Huang, Y. V.; Lee, D.; Sun, Y.; Chou, H.; Xu, B.; Lin, Z.; Branche, C.; Bayer, A. L.; Waliany, S.; Neal, J.; Wakelee, H.; Witteles, R.; Nguyen, P.; Graves, E. E.; Alcaide, P.; Berry, G. J.; Wu, S. M.; Zhu, H.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.576279\nBackground: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are successful in treating many cancers but may cause immune-related adverse events. ICI-mediated myocarditis has a high fatality rate of up to 40%, with severe cardiovascular consequences. Targeted therapies for ICI myocarditis are currently lacking. Methods: We used a genetic mouse model of PD-1 deletion (MRL/Pdcd1-/-) along with a novel drug-treated ICI myocarditis mouse model to recapitulate the disease phenotype. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCRseq), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) on immune cells isolated from MRL and MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice at serial timepoints. We assessed the impact of macrophage deletion in MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice, then inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in ICI-treated mice to assess therapeutic effect on myocarditis phenotype. Furthermore, we delineated functional effects of CXCR3 blockade on T-cell and macrophage interactions in a transwell assay. We then correlated the results in human single-cell multi-omics data from blood and heart biopsy data from patients with ICI myocarditis. Results: Single-cell multi-omics demonstrated expansion of CXCL9/10+CCR2+ macrophages and CXCR3hi CD8+ effector T-lymphocytes in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice correlating with onset of myocarditis development. Both depletion of CXCL9/10+CCR2+ macrophages and CXCR3 blockade respectively led to decreased CXCR3hiCD8+ T-cell infiltration into the heart and significantly improved survival. A transwell assay showed that selective blockade of CXCR3 and its ligand, CXCL10 decreased CD8+ T-cell migration towards macrophages, implicating this interaction in T-cell cardiotropism towards cardiac macrophages. Cardiac biopsies from patients with confirmed ICI myocarditis demonstrated infiltrating CXCR3+ lymphocytes and CXCL9+/CXCL10+ macrophages. Both mouse cardiac immune cells and patient peripheral blood immune cells revealed expanded TCRs correlating with CXCR3hi CD8+ T-cells in ICI myocarditis samples. Conclusions: These findings bring forth the CXCR3-CXCL9/10 axis as an attractive therapeutic target for ICI myocarditis treatment, and more broadly, as a druggable pathway in cardiac inflammation.\nPlasmodium RON11 triggers biogenesis of the merozoite rhoptry pair and is essential for erythrocyte invasion\nAuthors: Anaguano, D.; Adewale Fasoro, O.; Vick, G. S.; Blauwkamp, J. A.; Yanik, S.; Fierro, M. A.; Absalon, S.; SRINIVASAN, P.; Muralidharan, V.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577654\nMalaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs, begins with the invasion of RBCs by P. falciparum, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from two specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains seven transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the P. falciparum RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11 deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11 deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11 deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.\nThe evolutionary origins of the lysosome-related organelle sorting machinery reveal fundamental homology in post-endosome trafficking pathways\nAuthors: More, K. J.; Dacks, J. B.; Manna, P. T.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578091\nThe major organelles and pathways of the endomembrane system were in place by the time of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) ([~]1.5 billion years ago) and their acquisition were defining milestones during the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Comparative cell biology and evolutionary analyses show multiple instances of homology in the protein machinery controlling distinct inter-organelle trafficking routes. Resolving these homologous relationships allows us to explore processes underlying the emergence of new cellular compartments, infer ancestral states pre-dating LECA, and can even provide insight into the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Here we undertake a molecular evolutionary analysis, including providing a transcriptome of the jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana, exploring the origins of the machinery responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, the so-called Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complexes (BLOCs 1,2, and 3). This pathway has been studied only in animals and is not considered a feature of the basic eukaryotic cell plan. We show that this machinery, and by inference the corresponding sorting pathway, was likely in place prior to the divergence of eukaryotes and is found in a much more diverse array of eukaryotes than is currently assumed. As such, this sorting pathway is likely an underappreciated facet of broader eukaryotic cellular function. Moreover, we resolve multiple points of ancient homology between all three BLOCs and other post-endosomal retrograde trafficking machinery (BORC, CCZ1/MON1, and a newly identified relationship with HOPS/CORVET) offering a mechanistic and evolutionary unification of these trafficking pathways. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive account of the rise of the LRO biogenesis machinery from prokaryotic origins to current eukaryotic diversity, Asgard archaea to animals, integrating it into the larger mechanistic framework describing endomembrane evolution.\nAn evolutionary-conserved VPS34-PIKfyve-TRPML1-Myosin II axis regulates the speed of amoeboid cell migration\nAuthors: Dehio, P.; Michard, C.; Yam-Puc, J.

Spatial polarization of organelles within cells, including endo-lysosomes, is a prerequisite of migration. However, how ultrastructural polarization is linked to the signaling requirements governing T cell migration, remains unknown. Here we show that signaling molecules generated by endo-lysosome-localized kinases regulate velocity of amoeboid migration. Specifically, imaging of T cells identified accumulation of endo-lysosomes decorated with the lipid kinases VPS34-PIKfyve at the uropod of polarized cells. Activity of VPS34 and PIKfyve regulated speed, but not directedness, of migrating T cells. Mechanistically, PI(3,5)P2 generated by the sequential action of VPS34 and PIKfyve mediated Ca2+ efflux from lysosomes via the mucolipin TRP cation channel 1 (TRPML1), thus controlling activity of myosin IIA and hence the generation of propulsive force through retrograde actin flow. The VPS34-PIKfyve kinases also regulated velocity of myeloid cells, as well as of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum - establishing the axis as an evolutionary conserved speed control system of amoeboid cell migration.

K.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577412\nT cell immunity is impaired during ageing, particularly in memory responses needed for efficient vaccination. Autophagy and asymmetric cell division (ACD) are cell biological mechanisms key to memory formation, which undergo a decline upon ageing. However, despite the fundamental importance of these processes in cellular function, the link between ACD and in vivo fate decisions has remained highly correlative in T cells and in the field of mammalian ACD overall. Here we provide robust causal evidence linking ACD to in vivo T cell fate decisions and our data are consistent with the concept that initiation of asymmetric T cell fates is regulated by autophagy. Analysing the proteome of first-daughter CD8+ T cells following TCR-triggered activation, we reveal that mitochondrial proteins rely on autophagy for their asymmetric inheritance and that damaged mitochondria are polarized upon first division. These results led us to evaluate whether mitochondria were asymmetrically inherited and to functionally address their impact on T cell fate. For this we used a novel mouse model that allows sequential tagging of mitochondria in mother and daughter cells, enabling their isolation and subsequent in vivo analysis of CD8+ T cell progenies based on pre-mitotic cell cargo. Autophagy-deficient CD8+ T cells showed impaired clearance and symmetric inheritance of old mitochondria, suggesting that degradation events promote asymmetry and are needed to generate T cells devoid of old organelles. Daughter cells inheriting old mitochondria are more glycolytic and upon adoptive transfer show reduced memory potential, whereas daughter cells that have not inherited old mitochondria from the mother cell are long-lived and expand upon cognate-antigen challenge. Proteomic and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of cells inheriting aged mitochondria suggest that their early fate divergence relies on one carbon metabolism as a consequence of poor mitochondrial quality and function. These findings increase our understanding of how T cell diversity is early-imprinted during division and will help foster the development of strategies to modulate T cell function.

A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578072\nTor kinases play diverse and essential roles in control of nutrient signaling and cell growth. Tor kinases are assembled into two large multiprotein complexes referred to as Tor Complex 1 and Tor Complex 2 (TORC1 and TORC2). In budding yeast, TORC2 controls a signaling network that relays signals regarding carbon source that strongly influence growth rate and cell size. However, the mechanisms that control TORC2 signaling are poorly understood. Activation of TORC2 requires Mss4, a phosphoinositol kinase that initiates assembly of a multi-protein complex at the plasma membrane that recruits and activates downstream targets of TORC2. Localization of Mss4 to the plasma membrane is controlled by phosphorylation and previous work suggested that yeast homologs of casein kinase 1{gamma}, referred to as Yck1 and Yck2, control phosphorylation of Mss4. Here, we generated a new analog-sensitive allele of YCK2 and used it to test whether Yck1/2 influence signaling in the TORC2 network. We found that multiple components of the TORC2 network are strongly influenced by Yck1/2 signaling.\nReactive oxygen species suppress phagocyte surveillance by oxidizing cytoskeletal regulators\nAuthors: Ferling, I.; Pfalzgraf, S.; Moutounet, L.; Qiu, L.; Li, I.; Zhou, Y.; Freeman, S. A.; Grinstein, S.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578237\nDespite their superficial similarities, the phagocytosis of pathogens differs from that of apoptotic cells in their recognition mechanisms and downstream signaling pathways. While the initial stages of these processes have been studied, the cytoskeletal reorganization that follows particle uptake is not well understood. By comparing the uptake of phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated targets versus IgG-opsonized targets of identical size, shape, and rigidity, we noted remarkable differences in the accompanying changes in cell morphology, adhesion and migration that persisted long after phagocytosis. While myeloid cells continued to survey their microenvironment after engulfing PS-coated targets, the uptake of IgG-opsonized targets caused phagocytes to round up, decreased their membrane ruffling, and led to the complete disassembly of podosomes. These changes were associated with increased activation of Rho and a concomitant decrease of Rac activity that collectively resulted in the thickening and compaction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton. Rho/formin-induced actin polymers were fastened to the membrane by their preferential interaction with Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins, which were necessary for cell compaction and podosome disassembly following ingestion of IgG-coated particles. The source of the distinct responses to PS- versus IgG-targets was the differential activation of the respiratory burst mediated by the NADPH oxidase: reactive oxygen species (ROS), emanating from phagosomes containing IgG-opsonized targets, but not those containing PS-coated ones, directly led to the activation of Rho. Similar findings were made with phagocytes that encountered pathogens or microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPS) that instigate the activation of the NADPH oxidase. These results implicate a connection between sensing of harmful particulates, the oxidation of cytoskeletal regulators, and the immune surveillance by myeloid cells that have potentially important consequences for the containment of pathogens.\nDysregulated SASS6 expression promotes increased ciliogenesis and cell invasion phenotypes\nAuthors: Hargreaves, E.; Jenks, A.

E.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.576599\nCentriole and/or cilia defects are characteristic of cancer cells and have been linked to cancer cell invasion. However, the mechanistic basis of these effects is unknown. Spindle assembly abnormal protein 6 homolog (SAS-6) is essential for centriole biogenesis and cilia formation. In cycling cells, SAS-6 undergoes APCCdh1-mediated targeted degradation by the 26S proteasome at the end of mitosis. Little is known about the function of SAS-6 outside of centrosome biogenesis. To examine this, we expressed a non-degradable SAS-6 mutant (SAS-6ND). Expression of SAS-6ND led to an increase in ciliation and cilia-dependent cell invasion, and caused an upregulation of the YAP/TAZ pathway. YAP/TAZ or ciliogenesis inhibition prevented SAS-6-induced invasion. SAS-6ND caused increased actin alignment and stress fiber coherency, and nuclear flattening known to promote YAP nuclear import. Finally, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that SAS-6 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. Our data provide evidence for a defined role of SAS-6 in cancer cell invasion and offers mechanistic insight into the role of YAP/TAZ in this cilia-sensitive process.

        <p class="abstract">Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5 end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5 end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on removal of the poly(A) tail. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 fully rescues RNA length and suppresses stress-induced decay. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Oxidative stress perturbs lipid homeostasis and contributes to metabolic diseases. Though ignored compared to mitochondrial oxidation, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) generates reactive oxygen species requiring antioxidant quality control. Using multi-organismal profiling featuring Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells, here we characterize the paraoxonase-like APMAP as an ER-localized protein that promotes redox and lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein maturation. APMAP-depleted mammalian cells exhibit defective ER morphology, elevated ER and oxidative stress, lipid droplet accumulation, and perturbed ApoB-lipoprotein homeostasis. Critically, APMAP loss is rescued with chemical antioxidant NAC. Organismal APMAP depletion in Drosophila perturbs fat and lipoprotein homeostasis, and zebrafish display increased vascular ApoB-containing lipoproteins, particles that are atherogenic in mammals. Lipidomics reveals altered polyunsaturated phospholipids and increased ceramides upon APMAP loss, which perturbs ApoB-lipoprotein maturation. These ApoB-associated defects are rescued by inhibiting ceramide synthesis. Collectively, we propose APMAP is an ER-localized antioxidant that promotes lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis.

        <p class="abstract">Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are successful in treating many cancers but may cause immune-related adverse events. ICI-mediated myocarditis has a high fatality rate of up to 40%, with severe cardiovascular consequences. Targeted therapies for ICI myocarditis are currently lacking. Methods: We used a genetic mouse model of PD-1 deletion (MRL/Pdcd1-/-) along with a novel drug-treated ICI myocarditis mouse model to recapitulate the disease phenotype. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCRseq), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) on immune cells isolated from MRL and MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice at serial timepoints. We assessed the impact of macrophage deletion in MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice, then inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in ICI-treated mice to assess therapeutic effect on myocarditis phenotype. Furthermore, we delineated functional effects of CXCR3 blockade on T-cell and macrophage interactions in a transwell assay. We then correlated the results in human single-cell multi-omics data from blood and heart biopsy data from patients with ICI myocarditis. Results: Single-cell multi-omics demonstrated expansion of CXCL9/10&#43;CCR2&#43; macrophages and CXCR3hi CD8&#43; effector T-lymphocytes in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd1-/- mice correlating with onset of myocarditis development. Both depletion of CXCL9/10&#43;CCR2&#43; macrophages and CXCR3 blockade respectively led to decreased CXCR3hiCD8&#43; T-cell infiltration into the heart and significantly improved survival. A transwell assay showed that selective blockade of CXCR3 and its ligand, CXCL10 decreased CD8&#43; T-cell migration towards macrophages, implicating this interaction in T-cell cardiotropism towards cardiac macrophages. Cardiac biopsies from patients with confirmed ICI myocarditis demonstrated infiltrating CXCR3&#43; lymphocytes and CXCL9&#43;/CXCL10&#43; macrophages. Both mouse cardiac immune cells and patient peripheral blood immune cells revealed expanded TCRs correlating with CXCR3hi CD8&#43; T-cells in ICI myocarditis samples. Conclusions: These findings bring forth the CXCR3-CXCL9/10 axis as an attractive therapeutic target for ICI myocarditis treatment, and more broadly, as a druggable pathway in cardiac inflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs, begins with the invasion of RBCs by P. falciparum, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from two specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains seven transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the P. falciparum RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11 deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11 deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11 deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The major organelles and pathways of the endomembrane system were in place by the time of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) ([~]1.5 billion years ago) and their acquisition were defining milestones during the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Comparative cell biology and evolutionary analyses show multiple instances of homology in the protein machinery controlling distinct inter-organelle trafficking routes. Resolving these homologous relationships allows us to explore processes underlying the emergence of new cellular compartments, infer ancestral states pre-dating LECA, and can even provide insight into the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Here we undertake a molecular evolutionary analysis, including providing a transcriptome of the jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana, exploring the origins of the machinery responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, the so-called Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complexes (BLOCs 1,2, and 3). This pathway has been studied only in animals and is not considered a feature of the basic eukaryotic cell plan. We show that this machinery, and by inference the corresponding sorting pathway, was likely in place prior to the divergence of eukaryotes and is found in a much more diverse array of eukaryotes than is currently assumed. As such, this sorting pathway is likely an underappreciated facet of broader eukaryotic cellular function. Moreover, we resolve multiple points of ancient homology between all three BLOCs and other post-endosomal retrograde trafficking machinery (BORC, CCZ1/MON1, and a newly identified relationship with HOPS/CORVET) offering a mechanistic and evolutionary unification of these trafficking pathways. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive account of the rise of the LRO biogenesis machinery from prokaryotic origins to current eukaryotic diversity, Asgard archaea to animals, integrating it into the larger mechanistic framework describing endomembrane evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Amoeboid cell migration is key to efficient T cell immunity. Spatial polarization of organelles within cells, including endo-lysosomes, is a prerequisite of migration. However, how ultrastructural polarization is linked to the signaling requirements governing T cell migration, remains unknown. Here we show that signaling molecules generated by endo-lysosome-localized kinases regulate velocity of amoeboid migration. Specifically, imaging of T cells identified accumulation of endo-lysosomes decorated with the lipid kinases VPS34-PIKfyve at the uropod of polarized cells. Activity of VPS34 and PIKfyve regulated speed, but not directedness, of migrating T cells. Mechanistically, PI(3,5)P2 generated by the sequential action of VPS34 and PIKfyve mediated Ca2&#43; efflux from lysosomes via the mucolipin TRP cation channel 1 (TRPML1), thus controlling activity of myosin IIA and hence the generation of propulsive force through retrograde actin flow. The VPS34-PIKfyve kinases also regulated velocity of myeloid cells, as well as of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum - establishing the axis as an evolutionary conserved speed control system of amoeboid cell migration.

        <p class="abstract">T cell immunity is impaired during ageing, particularly in memory responses needed for efficient vaccination. Autophagy and asymmetric cell division (ACD) are cell biological mechanisms key to memory formation, which undergo a decline upon ageing. However, despite the fundamental importance of these processes in cellular function, the link between ACD and in vivo fate decisions has remained highly correlative in T cells and in the field of mammalian ACD overall. Here we provide robust causal evidence linking ACD to in vivo T cell fate decisions and our data are consistent with the concept that initiation of asymmetric T cell fates is regulated by autophagy. Analysing the proteome of first-daughter CD8&#43; T cells following TCR-triggered activation, we reveal that mitochondrial proteins rely on autophagy for their asymmetric inheritance and that damaged mitochondria are polarized upon first division. These results led us to evaluate whether mitochondria were asymmetrically inherited and to functionally address their impact on T cell fate. For this we used a novel mouse model that allows sequential tagging of mitochondria in mother and daughter cells, enabling their isolation and subsequent in vivo analysis of CD8&#43; T cell progenies based on pre-mitotic cell cargo. Autophagy-deficient CD8&#43; T cells showed impaired clearance and symmetric inheritance of old mitochondria, suggesting that degradation events promote asymmetry and are needed to generate T cells devoid of old organelles. Daughter cells inheriting old mitochondria are more glycolytic and upon adoptive transfer show reduced memory potential, whereas daughter cells that have not inherited old mitochondria from the mother cell are long-lived and expand upon cognate-antigen challenge. Proteomic and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of cells inheriting aged mitochondria suggest that their early fate divergence relies on one carbon metabolism as a consequence of poor mitochondrial quality and function. These findings increase our understanding of how T cell diversity is early-imprinted during division and will help foster the development of strategies to modulate T cell function.

Both segregation and degradation (autophagy) contribute to the asymmetric inheritance of old mitochondria.

Old mitochondria impact cell metabolism and function.

Cells devoid of old mitochondria exhibit better memory potential in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">Tor kinases play diverse and essential roles in control of nutrient signaling and cell growth. Tor kinases are assembled into two large multiprotein complexes referred to as Tor Complex 1 and Tor Complex 2 (TORC1 and TORC2). In budding yeast, TORC2 controls a signaling network that relays signals regarding carbon source that strongly influence growth rate and cell size. However, the mechanisms that control TORC2 signaling are poorly understood. Activation of TORC2 requires Mss4, a phosphoinositol kinase that initiates assembly of a multi-protein complex at the plasma membrane that recruits and activates downstream targets of TORC2. Localization of Mss4 to the plasma membrane is controlled by phosphorylation and previous work suggested that yeast homologs of casein kinase 1{gamma}, referred to as Yck1 and Yck2, control phosphorylation of Mss4. Here, we generated a new analog-sensitive allele of YCK2 and used it to test whether Yck1/2 influence signaling in the TORC2 network. We found that multiple components of the TORC2 network are strongly influenced by Yck1/2 signaling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite their superficial similarities, the phagocytosis of pathogens differs from that of apoptotic cells in their recognition mechanisms and downstream signaling pathways. While the initial stages of these processes have been studied, the cytoskeletal reorganization that follows particle uptake is not well understood. By comparing the uptake of phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated targets versus IgG-opsonized targets of identical size, shape, and rigidity, we noted remarkable differences in the accompanying changes in cell morphology, adhesion and migration that persisted long after phagocytosis. While myeloid cells continued to survey their microenvironment after engulfing PS-coated targets, the uptake of IgG-opsonized targets caused phagocytes to round up, decreased their membrane ruffling, and led to the complete disassembly of podosomes. These changes were associated with increased activation of Rho and a concomitant decrease of Rac activity that collectively resulted in the thickening and compaction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton. Rho/formin-induced actin polymers were fastened to the membrane by their preferential interaction with Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins, which were necessary for cell compaction and podosome disassembly following ingestion of IgG-coated particles. The source of the distinct responses to PS- versus IgG-targets was the differential activation of the respiratory burst mediated by the NADPH oxidase: reactive oxygen species (ROS), emanating from phagosomes containing IgG-opsonized targets, but not those containing PS-coated ones, directly led to the activation of Rho. Similar findings were made with phagocytes that encountered pathogens or microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPS) that instigate the activation of the NADPH oxidase. These results implicate a connection between sensing of harmful particulates, the oxidation of cytoskeletal regulators, and the immune surveillance by myeloid cells that have potentially important consequences for the containment of pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Centriole and/or cilia defects are characteristic of cancer cells and have been linked to cancer cell invasion. However, the mechanistic basis of these effects is unknown. Spindle assembly abnormal protein 6 homolog (SAS-6) is essential for centriole biogenesis and cilia formation. In cycling cells, SAS-6 undergoes APCCdh1-mediated targeted degradation by the 26S proteasome at the end of mitosis. Little is known about the function of SAS-6 outside of centrosome biogenesis. To examine this, we expressed a non-degradable SAS-6 mutant (SAS-6ND). Expression of SAS-6ND led to an increase in ciliation and cilia-dependent cell invasion, and caused an upregulation of the YAP/TAZ pathway. YAP/TAZ or ciliogenesis inhibition prevented SAS-6-induced invasion. SAS-6ND caused increased actin alignment and stress fiber coherency, and nuclear flattening known to promote YAP nuclear import. Finally, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that SAS-6 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. Our data provide evidence for a defined role of SAS-6 in cancer cell invasion and offers mechanistic insight into the role of YAP/TAZ in this cilia-sensitive process.
