These dynamics undergo transitions during development, often accompanying changes in collective cell behavior. While mechanisms have been established for individual cells dynamic behaviors, mechanisms and specific molecules that result in developmental transitions in vivo are still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of two developmental systems in Drosophila melanogaster to identify conditions that altered cortical patterning and dynamics. We identified a RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair whose relocalization from nucleus to cortex results in actomyosin waves in egg chambers. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of a different RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair resulted in actomyosin waves in the early embryo, during which RhoA activation precedes actomyosin assembly and RhoGAP recruitment by [~]4 seconds. Overall, we showed a mechanism involved in inducing actomyosin waves that is essential for oocyte development and is general to other cell types.\nFABP7 Progenitors are a Targetable Metabolic Root in the BRCA1 Breast\nAuthors: McCloskey, C. W.; Zhang, B.; Waas, M.; Abazari, G.; Vyas, F.; Aliar, K.; Tharmapalan, P.; Kuttanamkuzhi, A.; Narala, S.; Cruikshank, J.; Hofer, S. O. P.; Jackson, H. W.; Kislinger, T.; Berman, H. K.; Khokha, R.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565360\nIt has been nearly 3 decades since the discovery of the BRCA1/2 genes and their link to breast cancer risk, with prophylactic mastectomy remaining the primary management option for these high-risk mutation carriers. The current paucity of interception strategies is due to undefined, targetable cancer precursor populations in the high-risk breast. Despite known cellular alterations in the BRCA1 breast, epithelial populations at the root of unwarranted cell state transitions remain unresolved. Here, we identify a root progenitor population that is dysregulated in BRCA1 carriers stemming from the metabolic role of BRCA1. This fatty-acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) expressing luminal progenitor population is spatially confined to the mammary ducts, has enhanced clonogenic capacity, and is the predicted origin of mixed basal-luminal differentiation in the BRCA1 but not BRCA2 breast. We show global H3K27 acetylation is reduced within ductal FABP7 cells in BRCA1 carriers in situ, linking to a non-canonical metabolic role of BRCA1 in regulating acetyl-CoA pools and de novo fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate FABP7 progenitor capacity is preferentially ablated in BRCA1 carriers through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism using an FDA-approved fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor. This study lays the foundation for metabolic control of breast progenitor dynamics to mitigate breast cancer risk in the BRCA1 breast.\nThe role of the AP-1 adaptor complex in outgoing and incoming membrane traffic\nAuthors: Robinson, M. S.; Antrobus, R.; Sanger, A.; Davies, A. K.; Gershlick, D. C.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565271\nThe AP-1 adaptor complex is found in all eukaryotes, but it has been implicated in different pathways in different organisms. To look directly at AP-1 function, we generated stably transduced HeLa cells co-expressing tagged AP-1 and various tagged membrane proteins. Live cell imaging showed that AP-1 is recruited onto tubular carriers trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, as well as onto transferrin-containing early/recycling endosomes. Analysis of single AP-1 vesicles showed that they are a heterogeneous population, which start to sequester cargo by 30 minutes after exit from the ER. Vesicle capture showed that AP-1 vesicles contain transmembrane proteins found at the TGN and early/recycling endosomes, as well as lysosomal hydrolases, but very little of the anterograde adaptor GGA2. Together, our results support a model in which AP-1 retrieves proteins from post-Golgi compartments back to the TGN, analogous to COPIs role in the early secretory pathway. We propose that this is the function of AP-1 in all eukaryotes. SummaryRobinson et al. investigate AP-1 function using complementary approaches on cells co-expressing tagged AP-1 and cargo proteins. Their results support a model in which AP-1 is recruited onto post-Golgi carriers and early/recycling endosomes, where it retrieves selected proteins back to the TGN.\nDual regulation of SLC25A39 by AFG3L2 and iron controls mitochondrial glutathione homeostasis\nAuthors: Shi, X.; DeCiucis, M.; Grabinska, K. A.; Kanyo, J.; Liu, A.; Lam, T.; Shen, H.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565855\nOrganelle transporters define metabolic compartmentalization and how this metabolite transport process can be modulated is poorly explored. Here, we discovered that SLC25A39, a mitochondrial transporter critical for mitochondrial glutathione uptake, is a short-lived protein under dual regulation at the protein level. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and CRISPR KO in cells identified that mitochondrial m-AAA protease AFG3L2 is responsible for degrading SLC25A39 through the matrix loop 1. SLC25A39 senses mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster using four matrix cysteine residues and inhibits its degradation. SLC25A39 protein regulation is robust in developing and mature neurons. This dual transporter regulation, by protein quality control and metabolic sensing, allows modulating mitochondrial glutathione level in response to iron homeostasis, opening new avenues to explore regulation of metabolic compartmentalization. Neuronal SLC25A39 regulation connects mitochondrial protein quality control, glutathione and iron homeostasis, which were previously unrelated biochemical features in neurodegeneration.\nIpl1-controlled attachment maturation regulates Mps1 association with its kinetochore receptor\nAuthors: Pleuger, R.; Cozma, C.; Hohoff, S.; Denkhaus, C.; Dudziak, A.; Kaschani, F.; Musacchio, A.; Vetter, I. R.; Westermann, S.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564738\nFaithful chromosome segregation requires that sister chromatids establish bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature anaphase onset with incomplete attachments. However, how microtubule attachment and checkpoint signaling are coordinated remains unclear. The conserved kinase Mps1 initiates SAC signaling by localizing transiently to kinetochores in prometaphase and is released upon bi-orientation. Using biochemistry, structure predictions, and cellular assays, we shed light on this dynamic behaviour in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A conserved N-terminal segment of Mps1 binds the neck region of Ndc80:Nuf2, the main microtubule receptor of kinetochores. Mutational disruption of this interface, located at the backside of the paired CH-domains and opposite the microtubule-binding site, prevents Mps1 localization, eliminates SAC signalling, and impairs growth. The same interface of Ndc80:Nuf2 binds the microtubule-associated Dam1 complex. We demonstrate that the error correction kinase Ipl1/Aurora B controls the competition between Dam1 and Mps1 for the same binding site. Thus, binding of the Dam1 complex to Ndc80:Nuf2 may release Mps1 from the kinetochore to allow anaphase onset.\nAn interaction hub on Ndc80 complex facilitates dynamic recruitment of Mps1 to yeast kinetochores to promote accurate chromosome segregation\nAuthors: Parnell, E. J.; Jenson, E.; Miller, M. P.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566082\nAccurate chromosome segregation relies on kinetochores carrying out multiple functions, including establishing and maintaining microtubule attachments, forming precise bioriented attachments between sister chromatids, and activating the spindle assembly checkpoint. Central to these processes is the highly conserved Ndc80 complex. This kinetochore subcomplex interacts directly with microtubules, but also serves as a critical platform for recruiting kinetochore-associated factors and as a key substrate for error correction kinases. The precise manner in which these kinetochore factors interact, and regulate each others function, remains unknown - considerably hindering our understanding of how Ndc80 complex-dependent processes function together to orchestrate accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we aimed to uncover the role of Nuf2s CH domain, a component of the Ndc80 complex, in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Through extensive mutational analysis, we identified a conserved \"interaction hub\" comprising two segments in Nuf2s CH domain, forming the binding site for Mps1 within the yeast Ndc80 complex. Intriguingly, the interaction between Mps1 and the Ndc80 complex seems to be subject to regulation by competitive binding with other factors. Mutants disrupting this interaction hub exhibit defects in spindle assembly checkpoint function and severe chromosome segregation errors. Significantly, specifically restoring Mps1-Ndc80 complex association rescues these defects. Our findings shed light on the intricate regulation of Ndc80 complex-dependent functions and highlight the essential role of Mps1 in kinetochore biorientation and accurate chromosome segregation.\nCZ CELLxGENE Discover: A single-cell data platform for scalable exploration, analysis and modeling of aggregated data\nAuthors: CZI Single-Cell Biology, ; Abdulla, S.; Aevermann, B.; Assis, P.; Badajoz, S.; Bell, S.

This provides an exciting opportunity for unlocking new insights into health and disease, made possible by meta-analysis that span diverse datasets building on recent advances in large language models and other machine learning approaches. Despite the promise of these and emerging analytical tools for analyzing large amounts of data, a major challenge remains the sheer number of datasets and inconsistent format, data models and accessibility. Many datasets are available via unique portals platforms that often lack interoperability. Here, we present CZ CellxGene Discover (cellxgene.cziscience.com), a data platform that provides curated and interoperable data. This single-cell data resource, available via a free-to-use online data portal, hosts a growing corpus of community contributed data that spans more than 50 million unique cells. Curated, standardized, and associated with consistent cell-level metadata, this collection of interoperable single-cell transcriptomic data is the largest of its kind. A suite of tools and features enables accessibility and reusability of the data via both computational and visual interfaces to allow researchers to rapidly explore individual datasets and perform cross-corpus analysis. This functionality is enabling meta-analyses of tens of millions of cells across studies and tissues and providing global views of human cells at the resolution of single cells.\nVault particles are common contaminants of extracellular vesicle preparations\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Nizamudeen, Z.; Hill, C. J.; Parmenter, C.; Arkill, K. P.; Lambert, D. W.; Hunt, S.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566362\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) may contain a variety of molecular cargo including proteins and nucleic acids. Vault particle components have been repeatedly reported in the literature as EV cargo. Here, we demonstrated by small RNA sequencing that vault RNA (vtRNA) were highly abundant in EV pellets enriched by differential centrifugation. EVs were prepared by commonly used enrichment methods and biochemical assays used to determine whether vault particle components were bona fide EV cargo. EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Dynabead immunocapture. RNase and proteinase treatment of EV preparations demonstrated that most vtRNA and major vault protein (MVP) were not enclosed and protected within the EV membrane. Vault-like particles were visualised in differential centrifugation pellets by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. EVs enriched by size exclusion chromatography and those isolated by immunocapture post-ultracentrifugation showed co-purification of MVP, whereas EVs isolated by direct immunocapture from conditioned medium were MVP-negative. Taken together, commonly used isolation techniques, such as differential centrifugation and SEC, can lead to contamination of EVs with vault particles. The current study highlights the importance of determining the topology of putative EV-associated components to determine if they are EV cargo or contaminants that have been co-purified.\nA High-Throughput Data-Independent Acquisition Workflow for Deep Characterisation of the sn-Isomer Lipidome\nAuthors: Michael, J.

J.; Wheeler, R. J.; Gluenz, E.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566240\nProtein kinase A (PKA) is one of the most studied eukaryotic signal transducers and a key target of the second messenger cAMP. Kinetoplastids, a branch of early diverging eukaryotes, possess homologues of catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits that, unusually, are insensitive to cAMP with uncertainty about the endogenous activating ligand. While previous evidence has implicated both cAMP and PKA in the regulation of flagellar motility in kinetoplastids, the specific contributions of the two regulatory (PKAR) and three catalytic (PKAC) subunits of PKA remain unclear. Here we conducted a systematic study combining reverse genetics and microscopy analysis to investigate PKAC and PKAR subcellular localisations, pairing preferences, and the effect of PKA gene deletions on swimming speed and flagellar waveforms in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. LmxPKAC1, LmxPKAC2 and LmxPKAR1 are enriched in the flagellum and upon detergent extraction, the LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAC1 signals remained associated with the cytoskeleton. The flagellar LmxPKAC1 and LmxPKAC2 signals were, however, greatly diminished by removal of LmxPKAR1, consistent with an anchoring function for the R-subunit. Previous work identified the Streptomyces antimetabolite toyocamycin, activated the divergent PKA of Trypanosoma brucei. The patterns of sequence divergence within the phosphate binding cassettes of LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAR3 suggest both are divergent from T. brucei. We therefore tested the effect of toyocamycin and a similarly structured compound of the purine metabolism pathway, inosine, on the localisation of LmxPKAC1 and found that the LmxPKAC1 mNG signal was lost from the cytoskeletal fraction following treatment with either toyocamycin or inosine. LmxPKAC3 and LmxPKAR3 were localised to the cell cortex. Upon removal of LmxPKAR3, LmxPKAC3 was lost from the cortex and became distributed throughout the cell, including an increased presence in the flagellum. Assessing motility phenotypes, we found this increase of LmxPKAC3 signal in the flagellum correlated with an increase in swimming speed. Whereas the deletion of LmxPKAC3 resulted in flagella beating at significantly reduced frequencies and a resulting decrease in population swimming speed. Moreover, LmxPKAC1 null mutants showed a significantly reduced swimming speed and cells were unable to produce symmetric flagellar waves. Taken together these data indicate that the divergent PKA pathway in Leishmania modulates flagellar motility.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Actin cortex patterning and dynamics are critical for cell shape changes. These dynamics undergo transitions during development, often accompanying changes in collective cell behavior. While mechanisms have been established for individual cells dynamic behaviors, mechanisms and specific molecules that result in developmental transitions in vivo are still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of two developmental systems in Drosophila melanogaster to identify conditions that altered cortical patterning and dynamics. We identified a RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair whose relocalization from nucleus to cortex results in actomyosin waves in egg chambers. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of a different RhoGEF and RhoGAP pair resulted in actomyosin waves in the early embryo, during which RhoA activation precedes actomyosin assembly and RhoGAP recruitment by [~]4 seconds. Overall, we showed a mechanism involved in inducing actomyosin waves that is essential for oocyte development and is general to other cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It has been nearly 3 decades since the discovery of the BRCA1/2 genes and their link to breast cancer risk, with prophylactic mastectomy remaining the primary management option for these high-risk mutation carriers. The current paucity of interception strategies is due to undefined, targetable cancer precursor populations in the high-risk breast. Despite known cellular alterations in the BRCA1 breast, epithelial populations at the root of unwarranted cell state transitions remain unresolved. Here, we identify a root progenitor population that is dysregulated in BRCA1 carriers stemming from the metabolic role of BRCA1. This fatty-acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) expressing luminal progenitor population is spatially confined to the mammary ducts, has enhanced clonogenic capacity, and is the predicted origin of mixed basal-luminal differentiation in the BRCA1 but not BRCA2 breast. We show global H3K27 acetylation is reduced within ductal FABP7 cells in BRCA1 carriers in situ, linking to a non-canonical metabolic role of BRCA1 in regulating acetyl-CoA pools and de novo fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate FABP7 progenitor capacity is preferentially ablated in BRCA1 carriers through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism using an FDA-approved fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor. This study lays the foundation for metabolic control of breast progenitor dynamics to mitigate breast cancer risk in the BRCA1 breast.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The AP-1 adaptor complex is found in all eukaryotes, but it has been implicated in different pathways in different organisms. To look directly at AP-1 function, we generated stably transduced HeLa cells co-expressing tagged AP-1 and various tagged membrane proteins. Live cell imaging showed that AP-1 is recruited onto tubular carriers trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, as well as onto transferrin-containing early/recycling endosomes. Analysis of single AP-1 vesicles showed that they are a heterogeneous population, which start to sequester cargo by 30 minutes after exit from the ER. Vesicle capture showed that AP-1 vesicles contain transmembrane proteins found at the TGN and early/recycling endosomes, as well as lysosomal hydrolases, but very little of the anterograde adaptor GGA2. Together, our results support a model in which AP-1 retrieves proteins from post-Golgi compartments back to the TGN, analogous to COPIs role in the early secretory pathway. We propose that this is the function of AP-1 in all eukaryotes.

SummaryRobinson et al. investigate AP-1 function using complementary approaches on cells co-expressing tagged AP-1 and cargo proteins. Their results support a model in which AP-1 is recruited onto post-Golgi carriers and early/recycling endosomes, where it retrieves selected proteins back to the TGN.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organelle transporters define metabolic compartmentalization and how this metabolite transport process can be modulated is poorly explored. Here, we discovered that SLC25A39, a mitochondrial transporter critical for mitochondrial glutathione uptake, is a short-lived protein under dual regulation at the protein level. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and CRISPR KO in cells identified that mitochondrial m-AAA protease AFG3L2 is responsible for degrading SLC25A39 through the matrix loop 1. SLC25A39 senses mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster using four matrix cysteine residues and inhibits its degradation. SLC25A39 protein regulation is robust in developing and mature neurons. This dual transporter regulation, by protein quality control and metabolic sensing, allows modulating mitochondrial glutathione level in response to iron homeostasis, opening new avenues to explore regulation of metabolic compartmentalization. Neuronal SLC25A39 regulation connects mitochondrial protein quality control, glutathione and iron homeostasis, which were previously unrelated biochemical features in neurodegeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Faithful chromosome segregation requires that sister chromatids establish bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature anaphase onset with incomplete attachments. However, how microtubule attachment and checkpoint signaling are coordinated remains unclear. The conserved kinase Mps1 initiates SAC signaling by localizing transiently to kinetochores in prometaphase and is released upon bi-orientation. Using biochemistry, structure predictions, and cellular assays, we shed light on this dynamic behaviour in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A conserved N-terminal segment of Mps1 binds the neck region of Ndc80:Nuf2, the main microtubule receptor of kinetochores. Mutational disruption of this interface, located at the backside of the paired CH-domains and opposite the microtubule-binding site, prevents Mps1 localization, eliminates SAC signalling, and impairs growth. The same interface of Ndc80:Nuf2 binds the microtubule-associated Dam1 complex. We demonstrate that the error correction kinase Ipl1/Aurora B controls the competition between Dam1 and Mps1 for the same binding site. Thus, binding of the Dam1 complex to Ndc80:Nuf2 may release Mps1 from the kinetochore to allow anaphase onset.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate chromosome segregation relies on kinetochores carrying out multiple functions, including establishing and maintaining microtubule attachments, forming precise bioriented attachments between sister chromatids, and activating the spindle assembly checkpoint. Central to these processes is the highly conserved Ndc80 complex. This kinetochore subcomplex interacts directly with microtubules, but also serves as a critical platform for recruiting kinetochore-associated factors and as a key substrate for error correction kinases. The precise manner in which these kinetochore factors interact, and regulate each others function, remains unknown - considerably hindering our understanding of how Ndc80 complex-dependent processes function together to orchestrate accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we aimed to uncover the role of Nuf2s CH domain, a component of the Ndc80 complex, in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Through extensive mutational analysis, we identified a conserved &#34;interaction hub&#34; comprising two segments in Nuf2s CH domain, forming the binding site for Mps1 within the yeast Ndc80 complex. Intriguingly, the interaction between Mps1 and the Ndc80 complex seems to be subject to regulation by competitive binding with other factors. Mutants disrupting this interaction hub exhibit defects in spindle assembly checkpoint function and severe chromosome segregation errors. Significantly, specifically restoring Mps1-Ndc80 complex association rescues these defects. Our findings shed light on the intricate regulation of Ndc80 complex-dependent functions and highlight the essential role of Mps1 in kinetochore biorientation and accurate chromosome segregation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hundreds of millions of single cells have been analyzed to date using high throughput transcriptomic methods, thanks to technological advances driving the increasingly rapid generation of single-cell data. This provides an exciting opportunity for unlocking new insights into health and disease, made possible by meta-analysis that span diverse datasets building on recent advances in large language models and other machine learning approaches. Despite the promise of these and emerging analytical tools for analyzing large amounts of data, a major challenge remains the sheer number of datasets and inconsistent format, data models and accessibility. Many datasets are available via unique portals platforms that often lack interoperability. Here, we present CZ CellxGene Discover (cellxgene.cziscience.com), a data platform that provides curated and interoperable data. This single-cell data resource, available via a free-to-use online data portal, hosts a growing corpus of community contributed data that spans more than 50 million unique cells. Curated, standardized, and associated with consistent cell-level metadata, this collection of interoperable single-cell transcriptomic data is the largest of its kind. A suite of tools and features enables accessibility and reusability of the data via both computational and visual interfaces to allow researchers to rapidly explore individual datasets and perform cross-corpus analysis. This functionality is enabling meta-analyses of tens of millions of cells across studies and tissues and providing global views of human cells at the resolution of single cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may contain a variety of molecular cargo including proteins and nucleic acids. Vault particle components have been repeatedly reported in the literature as EV cargo. Here, we demonstrated by small RNA sequencing that vault RNA (vtRNA) were highly abundant in EV pellets enriched by differential centrifugation. EVs were prepared by commonly used enrichment methods and biochemical assays used to determine whether vault particle components were bona fide EV cargo. EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Dynabead immunocapture. RNase and proteinase treatment of EV preparations demonstrated that most vtRNA and major vault protein (MVP) were not enclosed and protected within the EV membrane. Vault-like particles were visualised in differential centrifugation pellets by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. EVs enriched by size exclusion chromatography and those isolated by immunocapture post-ultracentrifugation showed co-purification of MVP, whereas EVs isolated by direct immunocapture from conditioned medium were MVP-negative. Taken together, commonly used isolation techniques, such as differential centrifugation and SEC, can lead to contamination of EVs with vault particles. The current study highlights the importance of determining the topology of putative EV-associated components to determine if they are EV cargo or contaminants that have been co-purified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein kinase A (PKA) is one of the most studied eukaryotic signal transducers and a key target of the second messenger cAMP. Kinetoplastids, a branch of early diverging eukaryotes, possess homologues of catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits that, unusually, are insensitive to cAMP with uncertainty about the endogenous activating ligand. While previous evidence has implicated both cAMP and PKA in the regulation of flagellar motility in kinetoplastids, the specific contributions of the two regulatory (PKAR) and three catalytic (PKAC) subunits of PKA remain unclear. Here we conducted a systematic study combining reverse genetics and microscopy analysis to investigate PKAC and PKAR subcellular localisations, pairing preferences, and the effect of PKA gene deletions on swimming speed and flagellar waveforms in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. LmxPKAC1, LmxPKAC2 and LmxPKAR1 are enriched in the flagellum and upon detergent extraction, the LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAC1 signals remained associated with the cytoskeleton. The flagellar LmxPKAC1 and LmxPKAC2 signals were, however, greatly diminished by removal of LmxPKAR1, consistent with an anchoring function for the R-subunit. Previous work identified the Streptomyces antimetabolite toyocamycin, activated the divergent PKA of Trypanosoma brucei. The patterns of sequence divergence within the phosphate binding cassettes of LmxPKAR1 and LmxPKAR3 suggest both are divergent from T. brucei. We therefore tested the effect of toyocamycin and a similarly structured compound of the purine metabolism pathway, inosine, on the localisation of LmxPKAC1 and found that the LmxPKAC1 mNG signal was lost from the cytoskeletal fraction following treatment with either toyocamycin or inosine. LmxPKAC3 and LmxPKAR3 were localised to the cell cortex. Upon removal of LmxPKAR3, LmxPKAC3 was lost from the cortex and became distributed throughout the cell, including an increased presence in the flagellum. Assessing motility phenotypes, we found this increase of LmxPKAC3 signal in the flagellum correlated with an increase in swimming speed. Whereas the deletion of LmxPKAC3 resulted in flagella beating at significantly reduced frequencies and a resulting decrease in population swimming speed. Moreover, LmxPKAC1 null mutants showed a significantly reduced swimming speed and cells were unable to produce symmetric flagellar waves. Taken together these data indicate that the divergent PKA pathway in Leishmania modulates flagellar motility.</p>
