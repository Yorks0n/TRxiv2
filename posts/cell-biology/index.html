  "articleBody": " RNA binding proteins and glycoRNAs form domains on the cell surface for cell penetrating peptide entry\nAuthors: Perr, J.; Langen, A.; Almahayni, K.; Nestola, G.; Chai, P.; Lebedenko, C.; Volk, R.; Caldwell, R.; Spiekermann, M.; Hemberger, H.; Bisaria, N.; Tzelepis, K.; Calo, E.; Mockl, L.; Zaro, B.; Flynn, R. A.\nScore: 42.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556039\nThe composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.\nLipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases\nAuthors: Li, D.; Rocha Roa, C.; Schilling, M. A.; Reinisch, K.; Vanni, S.\nScore: 37.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555937\nGlycerophospholipids are synthesized primarily in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and must be equilibrated between bilayer leaflets to allow the ER and membranes derived from it to grow. Lipid equilibration is facilitated by integral membrane proteins called scramblases. These proteins feature a hydrophilic groove allowing the polar heads of lipids to traverse the hydrophobic membrane interior, similar to a credit-card moving through a reader. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental role in membrane expansion and dynamics, the identity of most scramblases has remained elusive. Here, combining biochemical reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases, integral membrane proteins which insert polypeptide chains into membranes of the ER and organelles disconnected from vesicle trafficking. Our data indicate that lipid scrambling occurs in the same hydrophilic channel through which protein insertion takes place, and that scrambling is abolished in the presence of nascent polypeptide chains. We propose that protein insertases could have a so-far overlooked role in membrane dynamics as scramblases.\nStructure of Native Chromatin Fibres Revealed by Cryo-ET in situ\nAuthors: Hou, Z.; Nightingale, F.; Zhu, Y.; MacGregor-Chatwin, C.; Zhang, P.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556082\nThe structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.\nNew structural features of the APC/C revealed by high resolution cryo-EM structures of apo-APC/C and the APC/C CDH1:EMI1 complex\nAuthors: Hoefler, A.; Yu, J.; Yang, J.; Zhang, Z.; Chang, L.; Grime, G. W.; Garman, E. F.; Boland, A.; Barford, D.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555674\nThe multi-subunit anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a master regulator of cell division. It controls progression through the cell cycle by timely marking mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The APC/C itself is regulated by the sequential action of its coactivator subunits CDC20 and CDH1, post-translational modifications, and its inhibitory binding partners EMI1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In this study, we took advantage of the latest developments in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human APC/CCDH1:EMI1 and apo-APC/C at 2.9 [A] and 3.2 [A], respectively, providing novel insights into the regulation of APC/C activity. The high resolution maps allowed the unambigious assignment of a previously unassigned -helix to the N-terminus of CDH1 (CDH11) in the APC/CCDH1:EMI1 ternary complex. CDH11 binds at the APC1:APC8 interface, thereby interacting with a loop segment of APC1 through electrostatic interactions only provided by CDH1 but not CDC20. We also indentified a novel zinc-binding module in APC2, and confirmed the presence of zinc ions experimentally. Finally, due to the higher resolution and well defined density of these maps we were able to build, aided by AlphaFold predictions, several intrinsically disordered regions in different APC/C subunits that play a fundamental role in proper complex assembly.\nTau fibrils induce nanoscale membrane damage and nucleate cytosolic tau at lysosomes\nAuthors: Rose, K.; Jepson, T.; Shukla, S.; Maya-Romero, A.; Kampmann, M.; Xu, K.; Hurley, J. H.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555157\nThe prion-like spread of protein aggregates is a leading hypothesis for the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in the brain, including the spread of tau inclusions associated with Alzheimers disease. The mechanisms of cellular uptake of tau seeds and subsequent nucleated polymerization of cytosolic tau are major questions in the field, and the potential for coupling between the entry and nucleation mechanisms has been little explored. We found that in primary astrocytes, endocytosis of tau seeds leads to their accumulation in lysosomes. This in turn leads to lysosomal swelling, deacidification and recruitment of ESCRT proteins, but not Galectin-3, to the lysosomal membrane. These observations are consistent with nanoscale damage of the lysosomal membrane. Using live cell and STORM, imaging, nucleation of cytosolic tau occurs primarily at the lysosome membrane under these conditions. These data suggest that tau seeds escape from lysosomes via nanoscale damage rather than wholesale rupture, and that nucleation of cytosolic tau commences as soon as tau fibril ends emerge from the lysosomal membrane.\nImaging of existing and newly translated proteins elucidates the mechanisms of sarcomere turnover\nAuthors: Douvdevany, G.; Erlich, I.; Haimovich-Caspi, L.; Prondzynski, M.; Pricolo, M. R.; Alegre-Cebollada, J.; Linke, W. A.; Carrier, L.; Kehat, I.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555653\nHow the sarcomeric complex is continuously turned-over in long-living cardiomyocytes is unclear. Here, we imaged the exchange of old and new Halo-tagged sarcomeric proteins. We disprove the prevailing protein pool model and instead show an ordered mechanism in which only newly translated proteins enter the sarcomeric complex while older ones are removed and degraded. We also show that degradation is independent of protein age, and that proteolytic extraction is a rate limiting step in the turnover. We imaged and quantified the turnover of expressed and endogenous sarcomeric proteins, including the giant protein titin, in cardiomyocytes in culture and in vivo, at the single cell and at the single sarcomere level. We show that replacement occurs at a similar rate within cells and across the heart and is markedly slower in adult cells. Our findings imply a new model of sarcomere turnover and sarcomeric subunit replacement.\nParkin is not required to sustain OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues\nAuthors: Filograna, R.; Gerlach, J.; Choi, H.-N.; Rigoni, G.; Barbaro, M.; Oscarson, M.; Lee, S.; Tiklova, K.; Ringner, M.; Koolmeister, C.; Wibom, R.; Riggare, S.; Nennesmo, I.; Perlmann, T.; Wredenberg, A.; Wedell, A.; Motori, E.; Svenningsson, P.; Larsson, N.-G.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556020\nLoss-of-function variants in the PRKN gene encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase PARKIN cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson s disease (PD). Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that PARKIN is involved in multiple pathways of mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial degradation and biogenesis. However, these findings are surrounded by substantial controversy due to conflicting experimental data. In addition, the existing PARKIN-deficient mouse models have failed to faithfully recapitulate PD phenotypes. Therefore, we have investigated the mitochondrial role of PARKIN during ageing and in response to stress by employing a series of conditional Parkin knockout mice. We report that PARKIN loss does not affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of aged mice. We also demonstrate that PARKIN deficiency does not exacerbate the brain defects and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in mice carrying high levels of mtDNA mutations. To rule out compensatory mechanisms activated during embryonic development of Parkin-deficient mice, we generated a mouse model where loss of PARKIN was induced in adult dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Surprisingly, also these mice did not show motor impairment or neurodegeneration, and no major transcriptional changes were found in isolated midbrain DA neurons. Finally, we report a patient with compound heterozygous PRKN pathogenic variants that lacks PARKIN and has developed PD. The PARKIN deficiency did not impair OXPHOS activities or induce mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle from the patient. Altogether, our results argue that PARKIN is dispensable for OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues.\nWeak neuronal glycolysis sustains cognition and organismal fitness\nAuthors: Jimenez-Blasco, D.; Agulla, J.; Lapresa, R.; Garcia-Macia, M.; Bobo-Jimenez, V.; Garcia-Rodriguez, D.; Manjarres-Raza, I.; Fernandez, E.; Jeanson, Y.; Khoury, S.; Portais, J.-C.; Padro, D.; Ramos-Cabrer, P.; Carmeliet, P.; Almeida, A.; Bolanos, J. P.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556016\napparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3), a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.\nHigh-resolution imaging of presynaptic ER networks in Atlastin mutants\nAuthors: Quinones-Frias, M. C.; Ocken, D. M.; Rodal, A. A.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555994\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous organelle that extends to the periphery of neurons and regulates many neuronal functions including neurite outgrowth, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. Mutations in proteins that control ER shape are linked to the neurodegenerative disorder Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP). However, the ultrastructure and dynamics of the neuronal ER have been under-investigated, particularly at presynaptic terminals. Here we developed new super-resolution and live imaging methods in D. melanogaster larval motor neurons to investigate ER structure at presynaptic terminals from wild-type animals, and in null mutants of the HSP gene Atlastin. Previous studies indicated diffuse localization of an ER lumen marker at Atlastin mutant presynaptic terminals, which was attributed to ER fragmentation. By contrast, we found using an ER membrane marker that the ER in Atlastin mutants formed robust networks. Further, our high-resolution imaging results suggest that overexpression of luminal ER proteins in Atlastin mutants causes their progressive displacement to the cytosol at synapses, perhaps due to proteostatic stress and/or changes in ER membrane integrity. Remarkably, these luminal ER proteins remain correctly localized in cell bodies, axons, and other cell types such as body wall muscles, suggesting that ER tubules at synapses have unique structural and functional characteristics. This displacement phenotype has not been reported in numerous studies of Atlastin in non-neuronal cells, emphasizing the importance of conducting experiments in neurons when investigating the mechanisms leading to upper motor neuron dysfunction in HSP.\nAn architectural role of oskar mRNA in granule assembly\nAuthors: Bose, M.; Rankovic, B.; Mahamid, J.; Ephrussi, A.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555701\nRibonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless condensates that organize the intracellular space by compartmentalization of specific RNAs and proteins1. Studies have shown that RNA tunes the phase behavior of RNA binding proteins (RBPs)2-4, but the role of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in assembly of RNP granules in vivo remains less explored5-7. Here, we determine the role of a sequence-specific RNA-RNA kissing-loop interaction in assembly of mesoscale oskar RNP granules in the female Drosophila germline. A two-nucleotide mutation that disrupts kissing-loop-mediated oskar mRNA dimerization impairs condensate formation in vitro, oskar granule assembly in the developing oocyte - leading to defective posterior localization of the RNA, and abrogation of oskar-associated processing bodies (P-bodies) upon nutritional stress. This specific trans RNA-RNA interaction acts synergistically with the scaffold RBP, Bruno8, in driving condensate assembly. Our study highlights the architectural contribution of an mRNA and its specific secondary structure and tertiary interactions in formation of an RNP granule essential for embryonic development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The composition and organization of the cell surface determine how cells interact with their environment. Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glycerophospholipids are synthesized primarily in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and must be equilibrated between bilayer leaflets to allow the ER and membranes derived from it to grow. Lipid equilibration is facilitated by integral membrane proteins called scramblases. These proteins feature a hydrophilic groove allowing the polar heads of lipids to traverse the hydrophobic membrane interior, similar to a credit-card moving through a reader. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental role in membrane expansion and dynamics, the identity of most scramblases has remained elusive. Here, combining biochemical reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases, integral membrane proteins which insert polypeptide chains into membranes of the ER and organelles disconnected from vesicle trafficking. Our data indicate that lipid scrambling occurs in the same hydrophilic channel through which protein insertion takes place, and that scrambling is abolished in the presence of nascent polypeptide chains. We propose that protein insertases could have a so-far overlooked role in membrane dynamics as scramblases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of chromatin plays pivotal roles in regulating gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome segregation. This structure, however, remains elusive. Using cryo-FIB and cryo-ET, we delineated the 3D architecture of native chromatin fibres in intact interphase human T-lymphoblasts and determined the in-situ structures of nucleosomes in different conformations. These chromatin fibres are not structured as uniform 30 nm one-start or two-start filaments but are composed of relaxed, variable zigzag organizations of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA. Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference. This work sets a precedent for future high-resolution investigations on native chromatin structures in-situ at both a single-nucleosome level and a population level under many different cellular conditions in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The multi-subunit anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a master regulator of cell division. It controls progression through the cell cycle by timely marking mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The APC/C itself is regulated by the sequential action of its coactivator subunits CDC20 and CDH1, post-translational modifications, and its inhibitory binding partners EMI1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In this study, we took advantage of the latest developments in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human APC/CCDH1:EMI1 and apo-APC/C at 2.9 [A] and 3.2 [A], respectively, providing novel insights into the regulation of APC/C activity. The high resolution maps allowed the unambigious assignment of a previously unassigned -helix to the N-terminus of CDH1 (CDH11) in the APC/CCDH1:EMI1 ternary complex. CDH11 binds at the APC1:APC8 interface, thereby interacting with a loop segment of APC1 through electrostatic interactions only provided by CDH1 but not CDC20. We also indentified a novel zinc-binding module in APC2, and confirmed the presence of zinc ions experimentally. Finally, due to the higher resolution and well defined density of these maps we were able to build, aided by AlphaFold predictions, several intrinsically disordered regions in different APC/C subunits that play a fundamental role in proper complex assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The prion-like spread of protein aggregates is a leading hypothesis for the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in the brain, including the spread of tau inclusions associated with Alzheimers disease. The mechanisms of cellular uptake of tau seeds and subsequent nucleated polymerization of cytosolic tau are major questions in the field, and the potential for coupling between the entry and nucleation mechanisms has been little explored. We found that in primary astrocytes, endocytosis of tau seeds leads to their accumulation in lysosomes. This in turn leads to lysosomal swelling, deacidification and recruitment of ESCRT proteins, but not Galectin-3, to the lysosomal membrane. These observations are consistent with nanoscale damage of the lysosomal membrane. Using live cell and STORM, imaging, nucleation of cytosolic tau occurs primarily at the lysosome membrane under these conditions. These data suggest that tau seeds escape from lysosomes via nanoscale damage rather than wholesale rupture, and that nucleation of cytosolic tau commences as soon as tau fibril ends emerge from the lysosomal membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How the sarcomeric complex is continuously turned-over in long-living cardiomyocytes is unclear. Here, we imaged the exchange of old and new Halo-tagged sarcomeric proteins. We disprove the prevailing  protein pool model and instead show an ordered mechanism in which only newly translated proteins enter the sarcomeric complex while older ones are removed and degraded. We also show that degradation is independent of protein age, and that proteolytic extraction is a rate limiting step in the turnover. We imaged and quantified the turnover of expressed and endogenous sarcomeric proteins, including the giant protein titin, in cardiomyocytes in culture and in vivo, at the single cell and at the single sarcomere level. We show that replacement occurs at a similar rate within cells and across the heart and is markedly slower in adult cells. Our findings imply a new model of sarcomere turnover and sarcomeric subunit replacement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss-of-function variants in the PRKN gene encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase PARKIN cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson s disease (PD). Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that PARKIN is involved in multiple pathways of mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial degradation and biogenesis. However, these findings are surrounded by substantial controversy due to conflicting experimental data. In addition, the existing PARKIN-deficient mouse models have failed to faithfully recapitulate PD phenotypes. Therefore, we have investigated the mitochondrial role of PARKIN during ageing and in response to stress by employing a series of conditional Parkin knockout mice. We report that PARKIN loss does not affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of aged mice. We also demonstrate that PARKIN deficiency does not exacerbate the brain defects and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in mice carrying high levels of mtDNA mutations. To rule out compensatory mechanisms activated during embryonic development of Parkin-deficient mice, we generated a mouse model where loss of PARKIN was induced in adult dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Surprisingly, also these mice did not show motor impairment or neurodegeneration, and no major transcriptional changes were found in isolated midbrain DA neurons. Finally, we report a patient with compound heterozygous PRKN pathogenic variants that lacks PARKIN and has developed PD. The PARKIN deficiency did not impair OXPHOS activities or induce mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle from the patient. Altogether, our results argue that PARKIN is dispensable for OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3), a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous organelle that extends to the periphery of neurons and regulates many neuronal functions including neurite outgrowth, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. Mutations in proteins that control ER shape are linked to the neurodegenerative disorder Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP). However, the ultrastructure and dynamics of the neuronal ER have been under-investigated, particularly at presynaptic terminals. Here we developed new super-resolution and live imaging methods in D. melanogaster larval motor neurons to investigate ER structure at presynaptic terminals from wild-type animals, and in null mutants of the HSP gene Atlastin. Previous studies indicated diffuse localization of an ER lumen marker at Atlastin mutant presynaptic terminals, which was attributed to ER fragmentation. By contrast, we found using an ER membrane marker that the ER in Atlastin mutants formed robust networks. Further, our high-resolution imaging results suggest that overexpression of luminal ER proteins in Atlastin mutants causes their progressive displacement to the cytosol at synapses, perhaps due to proteostatic stress and/or changes in ER membrane integrity. Remarkably, these luminal ER proteins remain correctly localized in cell bodies, axons, and other cell types such as body wall muscles, suggesting that ER tubules at synapses have unique structural and functional characteristics. This displacement phenotype has not been reported in numerous studies of Atlastin in non-neuronal cells, emphasizing the importance of conducting experiments in neurons when investigating the mechanisms leading to upper motor neuron dysfunction in HSP.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless condensates that organize the intracellular space by compartmentalization of specific RNAs and proteins1. Studies have shown that RNA tunes the phase behavior of RNA binding proteins (RBPs)2-4, but the role of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in assembly of RNP granules in vivo remains less explored5-7. Here, we determine the role of a sequence-specific RNA-RNA kissing-loop interaction in assembly of mesoscale oskar RNP granules in the female Drosophila germline. A two-nucleotide mutation that disrupts kissing-loop-mediated oskar mRNA dimerization impairs condensate formation in vitro, oskar granule assembly in the developing oocyte - leading to defective posterior localization of the RNA, and abrogation of oskar-associated processing bodies (P-bodies) upon nutritional stress. This specific trans RNA-RNA interaction acts synergistically with the scaffold RBP, Bruno8, in driving condensate assembly. Our study highlights the architectural contribution of an mRNA and its specific secondary structure and tertiary interactions in formation of an RNP granule essential for embryonic development.</p>
