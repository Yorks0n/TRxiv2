D.\nScore: 565.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546744\nNeutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.\nFilter-aided extracellular vesicle enrichment (FAEVEr)\nAuthors: Pauwels, J.; Van de Steene, T.; Van de Velde, J.; Eyckerman, S.; Gevaert, K.\nScore: 31.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547926\nA.Extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-delimited nanovesicles that are secreted by cells into the extracellular environment, are gaining substantial interest due to their involvement in cellular homeostasis and their contribution to disease pathology. The latter in particular has led to an exponential increase in interest in EVs as they are considered to be circulating packages containing potential biomarkers and are also a possible biological means to deliver drugs in a cell-specific manner. However, several challenges hamper straightforward analysis of EVs as they are generally low abundant and reside in complex biological matrices. These matrices typically contain protein concentrations that vastly exceed those of the EV proteome and contain particles in the same size and density range (e.g. protein aggregates and apolipoprotein particles). Therefore, extensive EV isolation and purification protocols are imperative and many have been developed, including (density) ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion and precipitation methods. Here, we describe an approach based on 300 kDa MWCO filtration, which allows processing of multiple samples in parallel within a reasonable timeframe and at moderate cost. We demonstrate that our strategy is capable of quantitatively retaining EV particles on filters, whilst allowing extensive washing with relatively high percentages of the mild detergent TWEEN-20. In addition, we provide evidence that the retained EVs can be recuperated from the filter for qualitative studies or can be directly lysed on the filter for the recovery of the EV protein cargo for proteome analysis. Applying this strategy on MCF7 conditioned medium using different percentages of serum, we observed dramatic changes in the EV proteome.\nA role for Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at the ER-endosome contact site in ESCRT-mediated sorting\nAuthors: Suzuki, S.; West, M.; Zhang, Y.; Fan, J. S.; Roberts, R. T.; Odorizzi, G.; Emr, S. D.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547997\nEndosomes are specialized organelles that function in the secretory and endocytic protein sorting pathways. Endocytosed cell surface receptors and transporters destined for lysosomal degradation are sorted into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) at endosomes by Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. The endosomes (multivesicular bodies, MVBs) then fuse with the lysosome. During endosomal maturation, the number of ILVs increases, but the size of endosomes does not decrease despite consumption of the limiting membrane during ILV formation. Vesicle-mediated trafficking is thought to provide lipids to support MVB biogenesis. However, we have uncovered an unexpected contribution of a large bridge-like lipid transfer protein, Vps13, in this process. Here, we reveal that Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at ER-endosome contact sites is required for the ESCRT pathway. We propose that Vps13 may play a critical role in supplying lipids to the endosome, ensuring continuous ESCRT-mediated sorting during MVB formation.\nPeripheral positioning of lysosomes supports melanoma aggressiveness\nAuthors: Jerabkova-Roda, K.; Mousson, A.; Peralta, M.; Karali, R.; Justiniano, H.; Lisii, L.-M.; Carl, P.; Asokan, N.; Busnelli, I.; Larnicol, A.; Lefebvre, O.; Lachuer, H.; Pichot, A.; Stemmelen, T.; Molitor, A.; Hirschler, A.; Delalande, F.; Sick, E.; Carapito, R.; Carapito, C.; Hyenne, V.; Schauer, K.; Ronde, P.; GOETZ, J. G.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548108\nEmerging evidences suggest that both function and position of organelles are pivotal for tumor cell dissemination. Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how the function of lysosomes is linked to their position and how this controls metastatic progression remains elusive. Here, we analyzed lysosome subcellular distribution in micropatterned patient-derived melanoma cells and found that lysosome spreading scales with their aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote invadopodia-based matrix degradation and invasion of melanoma cells, which is directly linked to their lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. When controlling lysosomal positioning using chemo-genetical heterodimerization in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosomal secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosomal spreading in a zebrafish metastasis model significantly reduces invasive outgrowth. Our study provides a mechanistic demonstration that lysosomal positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis.\nNuclear envelope assembly relies on CHMP-7 in the absence of BAF-LEM-mediated hole closure\nAuthors: Barger, S. R.; Penfield, L.; Bahmanyar, S.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547980\nBarrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a DNA binding protein that crosslinks chromatin to assemble the nuclear envelope (NE) after mitosis. BAF also binds the Lap2b-Emerin-Man1 (LEM) domain family of NE proteins to repair interphase ruptures. The NE adaptors to ESCRTs, LEMD2-CHMP7, seal NE holes surrounding mitotic spindle microtubules (MTs), but whether NE hole closure in mitosis involves BAF-LEM binding is not known. Here, we analyze NE sealing after meiosis II in C. elegans oocytes to show that BAF-LEM binding and LEM-2-CHMP-7 have distinct roles in hole closure around spindle MTs. LEM-2/EMR-1 (emerin) function redundantly with BAF-1 to seal the NE. Compromising BAF-LEM binding revealed an additional role for EMR-1 in maintenance of the NE permeability barrier and an essential role for LEM-2-CHMP-7 in preventing NE assembly failure. The WH domain of LEM-2 recruits the majority of CHMP-7 to the NE in C. elegans and a LEM-2 -independent pool of CHMP-7, which is mostly enriched in the nucleoplasm, also contributes to NE stability. Thus, NE hole closure surrounding spindle MTs requires redundant mechanisms that safeguard against failure in NE assembly to support embryogenesis.\nMetabolism regulates muscle stem cell self-renewal by connecting the microenvironment and histone acetylation\nAuthors: Ly, C.

M.; Ritchie, M. E.; Lynch, G. S.; Ryall, J. G.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547746\nSkeletal muscle contains a resident population of somatic stem cells capable of both self-renewal and differentiation. The signals that regulate this important decision have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we use metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to identity a state of localized hyperglycaemia following skeletal muscle injury. We show that committed muscle progenitor cells exhibit an enrichment of glycolytic and TCA cycle genes and that extracellular monosaccharide availability regulates intracellular citrate levels and global histone acetylation. Muscle stem cells exposed to a reduced (or altered) monosaccharide environment demonstrate reduced global histone acetylation and transcription of myogenic determination factors (including myod1). Importantly, reduced monosaccharide availability was linked directly to increased rates of asymmetric division and muscle stem cell self-renewal in regenerating skeletal muscle. Our results reveal an important role for the extracellular metabolic environment in the decision to undergo self-renewal or myogenic commitment during skeletal muscle regeneration.\nDynein and dynactin move long-range but are delivered separately to the axon tip\nAuthors: Fellows, A. D.; Bruntraeger, M.; Burgold, T.; Bassett, A. R.; Carter, A. P.\nScore: 49.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547521\nThe microtubule motor dynein drives retrograde transport from the axon tip back to the cell body and is essential for neuronal survival. Its function requires its cofactor dynactin and regulators LIS1 and NDEL1. However, it is unclear if all dynein components can travel along the axon, how far they move and whether they do so together. Here, we use neuron-inducible (NGN2-OPTi-OX) human-stem-cell lines to endogenously tag dynein components and track them under a near single molecule regime. In the retrograde direction dynein and dynactin can move the entire \u003e 500 {micro}m length of the axon in one go. Furthermore, LIS1 and NDEL1 also undergo long-distance movement, despite being mainly implicated with initiation of transport. Intriguingly, in the anterograde direction dynein/LIS1 move faster than dynactin/NDEL1 implying they can travel on different cargos. Therefore, neurons ensure efficient transport by keeping dynein/dynactin on cargos over long distances, but keeping them separate until their function is required.\nMitochondria- and ER-associated actin are required for mitochondrial fusion\nAuthors: Gatti, P.; Schiavon, C. R.; Manor, U.; Germain, M.\nScore: 28.7, Published: 2023-06-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544768\nMitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and signalling. Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove damaged or defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments that drive the recruitment and activation of the fission GTPase DRP1. On the other hand, the role of mitochondria- and ER- associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fusion remains unknown. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER using organelle- targeted Disassembly-promoting, encodable Actin tools (DeActs) blocks both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, and both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin in mitochondrial fusion.\nActivation of goblet cell stress sensor IRE1β is controlled by the mucin chaperone AGR2\nAuthors: Cloots, E.; Guilbert, P.; Provost, M.; Neidhardt, L.; Van de Velde, E.; Fayazpour, F.; De Sutter, D.; Savvides, S. N.; Eyckerman, S.; Janssens, S.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547951\nAs secretory cells specialized in the production of mucins, intestinal goblet cells are challenged by the need for efficient protein folding. Goblet cells express Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1{beta} (IRE1{beta}), a unique unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor that is part of an adaptive mechanism that regulates the demands of mucin production and secretion. However, how IRE1{beta} activity is tuned to mucus folding load remains unknown. We identified the disulfide isomerase and mucin chaperone AGR2 as a goblet cell specific protein that crucially regulates IRE1{beta}-, but not IRE1-mediated signaling. AGR2 binding to IRE1{beta} disrupts IRE1{beta} dimerization, thereby blocking its downstream endonuclease activity. Depletion of endogenous AGR2 from goblet cells induces spontaneous IRE1{beta} activation, suggesting that alterations in AGR2 availability in the endoplasmic reticulum sets the threshold for IRE1{beta} activation. We found that AGR2 mutants lacking their catalytic cysteine or displaying the disease-associated mutation H117Y were no longer able to dampen IRE1{beta} activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AGR2 is a central chaperone regulating the goblet cell UPR by acting as a rheostat of IRE1{beta} endonuclease activity.\nA matrisome atlas of germ cell development\nAuthors: Amran, A.; Pigatto, L.; Farley, J.; Godini, R.; Pocock, R.; Gopal, S.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547647\nThe extracellular matrix (matrisome) provides chemical and mechanical cues to control the structure and function of cells and tissues. Yet, comprehensive understanding of how matrisome factors individually and collectively control cell and tissue behavior in vivo is lacking. Here, we systematically investigate the function of 443 conserved matrisome-coding genes in controlling germ cell behavior within a complex tissue - the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. Using high-content imaging, 3D reconstruction and cell behavior analysis of \u003e3500 germlines and \u003e7 million germ cells, we identify specific matrisome factors that regulate germline structure, protein distribution, germ cell cycle and fate, apoptosis, and oocyte health. These findings reveal matrisome networks acting autonomously and non-autonomously to coordinate germ cell behavior, providing new avenues to study and manipulate cell fates.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils exhibit self-amplified swarming to sites of injury and infection. How swarming is controlled to ensure the proper level of neutrophil recruitment is unknown. Using an ex vivo model of infection, we find that human neutrophils use active relay to generate multiple pulsatile waves of swarming signals. Unlike classic active relay systems such as action potentials, neutrophil swarming relay waves are self-extinguishing, limiting the spatial range of cell recruitment. We identify an NADPH-oxidase-based negative feedback loop that is needed for this self-extinguishing behavior. Through this circuit, neutrophils adjust the number and size of swarming waves for homeostatic levels of cell recruitment over a wide range of initial cell densities. We link a broken homeostat to neutrophil over-recruitment in the context of human chronic granulomatous disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A.Extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-delimited nanovesicles that are secreted by cells into the extracellular environment, are gaining substantial interest due to their involvement in cellular homeostasis and their contribution to disease pathology. The latter in particular has led to an exponential increase in interest in EVs as they are considered to be circulating packages containing potential biomarkers and are also a possible biological means to deliver drugs in a cell-specific manner. However, several challenges hamper straightforward analysis of EVs as they are generally low abundant and reside in complex biological matrices. These matrices typically contain protein concentrations that vastly exceed those of the EV proteome and contain particles in the same size and density range (e.g. protein aggregates and apolipoprotein particles). Therefore, extensive EV isolation and purification protocols are imperative and many have been developed, including (density) ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion and precipitation methods. Here, we describe an approach based on 300 kDa MWCO filtration, which allows processing of multiple samples in parallel within a reasonable timeframe and at moderate cost. We demonstrate that our strategy is capable of quantitatively retaining EV particles on filters, whilst allowing extensive washing with relatively high percentages of the mild detergent TWEEN-20. In addition, we provide evidence that the retained EVs can be recuperated from the filter for qualitative studies or can be directly lysed on the filter for the recovery of the EV protein cargo for proteome analysis. Applying this strategy on MCF7 conditioned medium using different percentages of serum, we observed dramatic changes in the EV proteome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endosomes are specialized organelles that function in the secretory and endocytic protein sorting pathways. Endocytosed cell surface receptors and transporters destined for lysosomal degradation are sorted into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) at endosomes by Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. The endosomes (multivesicular bodies, MVBs) then fuse with the lysosome. During endosomal maturation, the number of ILVs increases, but the size of endosomes does not decrease despite consumption of the limiting membrane during ILV formation. Vesicle-mediated trafficking is thought to provide lipids to support MVB biogenesis. However, we have uncovered an unexpected contribution of a large bridge-like lipid transfer protein, Vps13, in this process. Here, we reveal that Vps13-mediated lipid transfer at ER-endosome contact sites is required for the ESCRT pathway. We propose that Vps13 may play a critical role in supplying lipids to the endosome, ensuring continuous ESCRT-mediated sorting during MVB formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emerging evidences suggest that both function and position of organelles are pivotal for tumor cell dissemination. Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how the function of lysosomes is linked to their position and how this controls metastatic progression remains elusive. Here, we analyzed lysosome subcellular distribution in micropatterned patient-derived melanoma cells and found that lysosome spreading scales with their aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote invadopodia-based matrix degradation and invasion of melanoma cells, which is directly linked to their lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. When controlling lysosomal positioning using chemo-genetical heterodimerization in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosomal secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosomal spreading in a zebrafish metastasis model significantly reduces invasive outgrowth. Our study provides a mechanistic demonstration that lysosomal positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a DNA binding protein that crosslinks chromatin to assemble the nuclear envelope (NE) after mitosis. BAF also binds the Lap2b-Emerin-Man1 (LEM) domain family of NE proteins to repair interphase ruptures. The NE adaptors to ESCRTs, LEMD2-CHMP7, seal NE holes surrounding mitotic spindle microtubules (MTs), but whether NE hole closure in mitosis involves BAF-LEM binding is not known. Here, we analyze NE sealing after meiosis II in C. elegans oocytes to show that BAF-LEM binding and LEM-2-CHMP-7 have distinct roles in hole closure around spindle MTs. LEM-2/EMR-1 (emerin) function redundantly with BAF-1 to seal the NE. Compromising BAF-LEM binding revealed an additional role for EMR-1 in maintenance of the NE permeability barrier and an essential role for LEM-2-CHMP-7 in preventing NE assembly failure. The WH domain of LEM-2 recruits the majority of CHMP-7 to the NE in C. elegans and a LEM-2 -independent pool of CHMP-7, which is mostly enriched in the nucleoplasm, also contributes to NE stability. Thus, NE hole closure surrounding spindle MTs requires redundant mechanisms that safeguard against failure in NE assembly to support embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle contains a resident population of somatic stem cells capable of both self-renewal and differentiation. The signals that regulate this important decision have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we use metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to identity a state of localized hyperglycaemia following skeletal muscle injury. We show that committed muscle progenitor cells exhibit an enrichment of glycolytic and TCA cycle genes and that extracellular monosaccharide availability regulates intracellular citrate levels and global histone acetylation. Muscle stem cells exposed to a reduced (or altered) monosaccharide environment demonstrate reduced global histone acetylation and transcription of myogenic determination factors (including myod1). Importantly, reduced monosaccharide availability was linked directly to increased rates of asymmetric division and muscle stem cell self-renewal in regenerating skeletal muscle. Our results reveal an important role for the extracellular metabolic environment in the decision to undergo self-renewal or myogenic commitment during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microtubule motor dynein drives retrograde transport from the axon tip back to the cell body and is essential for neuronal survival. Its function requires its cofactor dynactin and regulators LIS1 and NDEL1. However, it is unclear if all dynein components can travel along the axon, how far they move and whether they do so together. Here, we use neuron-inducible (NGN2-OPTi-OX) human-stem-cell lines to endogenously tag dynein components and track them under a near single molecule regime. In the retrograde direction dynein and dynactin can move the entire &gt; 500 {micro}m length of the axon in one go. Furthermore, LIS1 and NDEL1 also undergo long-distance movement, despite being mainly implicated with initiation of transport. Intriguingly, in the anterograde direction dynein/LIS1 move faster than dynactin/NDEL1 implying they can travel on different cargos. Therefore, neurons ensure efficient transport by keeping dynein/dynactin on cargos over long distances, but keeping them separate until their function is required.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and signalling. Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove damaged or defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments that drive the recruitment and activation of the fission GTPase DRP1. On the other hand, the role of mitochondria- and ER- associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fusion remains unknown. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER using organelle- targeted Disassembly-promoting, encodable Actin tools (DeActs) blocks both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, and both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin in mitochondrial fusion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As secretory cells specialized in the production of mucins, intestinal goblet cells are challenged by the need for efficient protein folding. Goblet cells express Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1{beta} (IRE1{beta}), a unique unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor that is part of an adaptive mechanism that regulates the demands of mucin production and secretion. However, how IRE1{beta} activity is tuned to mucus folding load remains unknown. We identified the disulfide isomerase and mucin chaperone AGR2 as a goblet cell specific protein that crucially regulates IRE1{beta}-, but not IRE1-mediated signaling. AGR2 binding to IRE1{beta} disrupts IRE1{beta} dimerization, thereby blocking its downstream endonuclease activity. Depletion of endogenous AGR2 from goblet cells induces spontaneous IRE1{beta} activation, suggesting that alterations in AGR2 availability in the endoplasmic reticulum sets the threshold for IRE1{beta} activation. We found that AGR2 mutants lacking their catalytic cysteine or displaying the disease-associated mutation H117Y were no longer able to dampen IRE1{beta} activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AGR2 is a central chaperone regulating the goblet cell UPR by acting as a rheostat of IRE1{beta} endonuclease activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The extracellular matrix (matrisome) provides chemical and mechanical cues to control the structure and function of cells and tissues. Yet, comprehensive understanding of how matrisome factors individually and collectively control cell and tissue behavior in vivo is lacking. Here, we systematically investigate the function of 443 conserved matrisome-coding genes in controlling germ cell behavior within a complex tissue - the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. Using high-content imaging, 3D reconstruction and cell behavior analysis of &gt;3500 germlines and &gt;7 million germ cells, we identify specific matrisome factors that regulate germline structure, protein distribution, germ cell cycle and fate, apoptosis, and oocyte health. These findings reveal matrisome networks acting autonomously and non-autonomously to coordinate germ cell behavior, providing new avenues to study and manipulate cell fates.</p>
