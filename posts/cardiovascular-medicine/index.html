D.; Borglum, A. D.; Lewis, C. M.; McIntosh, A. M.; Valdimarsdottir, U. A.; Andreassen, O. A.; Sullivan, P. F.; Lu, Y.; Fang, F.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294931\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are often comorbid, resulting in excess morbidity and mortality. Using genetic data, this study elucidates biological mechanisms, key risk factors, and causal pathways underlying the comorbidity. We show that CVDs share a large proportion of their genetic risk factors with MDD. Multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shared genetic liability between MDD and CVD revealed seven novel loci and distinct patterns of tissue and brain cell-type enrichments, suggesting a role for the thalamus. Part of the genetic overlap was explained by shared inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risk factors. Finally, we found support for causal effects of genetic liability to MDD on CVD risk, but not vice versa, and demonstrated that the causal effects are partly explained by metabolic and psychosocial factors. The distinct signature of MDD-CVD comorbidity aligns with the idea of an immunometabolic sub-type of MDD more strongly associated with CVD than overall MDD. In summary, we identify plausible biological mechanisms underlying MDD-CVD comorbidity, as well as key modifiable risk factors for prevention of CVD in individuals with MDD.\nKnowledge, Attitudes and Demand Toward Cardiovascular Polygenic Risk Testing in Clinical Practice: Cross-Sectional Survey of Patients\nAuthors: Brar, S.; Townsend, J.; Phulka, J. S.; Halperin, L.; Liew, J.; Parker, J. D.; Brunham, L. R.; Laksman, Z.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294594\nBackgroundThe goal of this study was to assess patients prior exposure and current level of knowledge of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We also explored reactions to receiving a high-risk or low-risk score, and gauged the overall attitudes and demand patients have with regards to PRSs. MethodsWe developed an online investigator-designed survey based on existing validated tools and previously designed surveys on genetic testing. There were two versions of the survey, one including a hypothetical high-risk PRS and one with a low-risk PRS. We administered the survey among patients attending a specialized cardiovascular prevention clinic. ResultsA total of 226 participants responded to the survey. The study population was predominantly high-income earning, educated, and of European descent. 177 patients (79%) had never read or heard about polygenic testing. 209 patients (93%) had never discussed polygenic testing with their health care professional (HCP). 208 patients (93%) had never received polygenic testing. The average score on the knowledge quiz was 2.47/10 [95% C.I. (2.17, 2.78)]. Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 20.52/35 [95% C.I. (16.14, 24.9)] with regards to negative emotions while low-risk survey participants scored 17.96/35 [95% C.I. (13.98, 21.94)] (p\u003c0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 5.78/10 [95% C.I. (3.77, 7.79)] with regards to uncertainty and low-risk survey participants scored 4.34/10 [95% C.I. (2.50, 6.18)] (p\u003c0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 12.42/15 [95% C.I. (10.43, 14.41)] for demand and low-risk survey participants scored 12.22/15 [95% C.I. (9.66, 14.78)] (p=0.549). ConclusionsPatients have limited prior exposure and knowledge of PRSs. Compared to receiving a low-risk score, participants receiving a high-risk score have more negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty. Despite the lack of knowledge, and the high rate of negative emotions and uncertainty, demand for PRSs in cardiology practice is high and expected to increase.\nSerum metabolomics improve risk stratification for incident heart failure\nAuthors: Oexner, R. R.; Ahn, H.; Theofilatos, K.; Shah, R. A.; Schmitt, R.; Chowienczyk, P.; Zoccarato, A.; Shah, A. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294202\nBackground and AimsPrediction and early detection of heart failure (HF) is crucial to mitigate its impact on quality of life, survival, and healthcare expenditure. In this study, we explored the predictive value of serum metabolomics (168 metabolites detected by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy) for incident HF. MethodsWe leveraged data of 68,311 individuals and \u003e 0.8 million person-years of follow-up from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to assess individual metabolite associations and to train models to predict HF risk in individuals not previously considered at risk. Specifically, we (I) fitted per-metabolite COX proportional hazards (COX-PH) models to assess individual metabolite associations and (II) trained and internally validated elastic net (EN) models to predict incident HF using the serum metabolome. We benchmarked discriminative capacities against a comprehensive, well-validated clinical risk score (Pooled Cohort Equations to Prevent HF, PCP-HF1). ResultsDuring median follow-up of {approx} 12.3 years, several metabolites showed independent association with incident HF (90/168 adjusting for age and sex, 48/168 adjusting for PCP-HF; false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled P \u003c 0.01). Performance-optimized risk models effectively retained key predictors representing highly correlated clusters ({approx} 80 % feature reduction). The addition of metabolomics to PCP-HF improved predictive performance (Harrels C: 0.768 vs. 0.755.; continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) = 0.287; relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI): 17.47 %). Simplified models including age, sex and metabolomics performed almost as well as PCP-HF (Harrels C: 0.745 vs. 0.755, continuous NRI: 0.097, relative IDI: 13.445 %). Risk and survival stratification was improved by the integration of metabolomics. ConclusionsThe assessment of serum metabolomics improves incident HF risk prediction. Scores based simply on age, sex and metabolomics exhibit similar predictive power to clinically-based models, potentially offering a cost- and time-effective, standardizable, and scalable single-domain alternative to more complex clinical scores.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are often comorbid, resulting in excess morbidity and mortality. Using genetic data, this study elucidates biological mechanisms, key risk factors, and causal pathways underlying the comorbidity. We show that CVDs share a large proportion of their genetic risk factors with MDD. Multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shared genetic liability between MDD and CVD revealed seven novel loci and distinct patterns of tissue and brain cell-type enrichments, suggesting a role for the thalamus. Part of the genetic overlap was explained by shared inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risk factors. Finally, we found support for causal effects of genetic liability to MDD on CVD risk, but not vice versa, and demonstrated that the causal effects are partly explained by metabolic and psychosocial factors. The distinct signature of MDD-CVD comorbidity aligns with the idea of an immunometabolic sub-type of MDD more strongly associated with CVD than overall MDD. In summary, we identify plausible biological mechanisms underlying MDD-CVD comorbidity, as well as key modifiable risk factors for prevention of CVD in individuals with MDD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe goal of this study was to assess patients prior exposure and current level of knowledge of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We also explored reactions to receiving a high-risk or low-risk score, and gauged the overall attitudes and demand patients have with regards to PRSs.

MethodsWe developed an online investigator-designed survey based on existing validated tools and previously designed surveys on genetic testing. There were two versions of the survey, one including a hypothetical high-risk PRS and one with a low-risk PRS. We administered the survey among patients attending a specialized cardiovascular prevention clinic.

ResultsA total of 226 participants responded to the survey. The study population was predominantly high-income earning, educated, and of European descent. 177 patients (79%) had never read or heard about polygenic testing. 209 patients (93%) had never discussed polygenic testing with their health care professional (HCP). 208 patients (93%) had never received polygenic testing.

The average score on the knowledge quiz was 2.47/10 [95% C.I. (2.17, 2.78)]. Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 20.52/35 [95% C.I. (16.14, 24.9)] with regards to negative emotions while low-risk survey participants scored 17.96/35 [95% C.I. (13.98, 21.94)] (p&lt;0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 5.78/10 [95% C.I. (3.77, 7.79)] with regards to uncertainty and low-risk survey participants scored 4.34/10 [95% C.I. (2.50, 6.18)] (p&lt;0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 12.42/15 [95% C.I. (10.43, 14.41)] for demand and low-risk survey participants scored 12.22/15 [95% C.I. (9.66, 14.78)] (p=0.549).

ConclusionsPatients have limited prior exposure and knowledge of PRSs. Compared to receiving a low-risk score, participants receiving a high-risk score have more negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty. Despite the lack of knowledge, and the high rate of negative emotions and uncertainty, demand for PRSs in cardiology practice is high and expected to increase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsPrediction and early detection of heart failure (HF) is crucial to mitigate its impact on quality of life, survival, and healthcare expenditure. In this study, we explored the predictive value of serum metabolomics (168 metabolites detected by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy) for incident HF.

MethodsWe leveraged data of 68,311 individuals and &gt; 0.8 million person-years of follow-up from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to assess individual metabolite associations and to train models to predict HF risk in individuals not previously considered at risk. Specifically, we (I) fitted per-metabolite COX proportional hazards (COX-PH) models to assess individual metabolite associations and (II) trained and internally validated elastic net (EN) models to predict incident HF using the serum metabolome. We benchmarked discriminative capacities against a comprehensive, well-validated clinical risk score (Pooled Cohort Equations to Prevent HF, PCP-HF1).

ResultsDuring median follow-up of {approx} 12.3 years, several metabolites showed independent association with incident HF (90/168 adjusting for age and sex, 48/168 adjusting for PCP-HF; false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled P &lt; 0.01). Performance-optimized risk models effectively retained key predictors representing highly correlated clusters ({approx} 80 % feature reduction). The addition of metabolomics to PCP-HF improved predictive performance (Harrels C: 0.768 vs. 0.755.; continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) = 0.287; relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI): 17.47 %). Simplified models including age, sex and metabolomics performed almost as well as PCP-HF (Harrels C: 0.745 vs. 0.755, continuous NRI: 0.097, relative IDI: 13.445 %). Risk and survival stratification was improved by the integration of metabolomics.

ConclusionsThe assessment of serum metabolomics improves incident HF risk prediction. Scores based simply on age, sex and metabolomics exhibit similar predictive power to clinically-based models, potentially offering a cost- and time-effective, standardizable, and scalable single-domain alternative to more complex clinical scores.</p>
