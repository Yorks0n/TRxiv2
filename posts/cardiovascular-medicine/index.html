MethodsWe developed and externally validated extracellular volume (ECV) prediction models incorporating readily available data (comorbidity and natriuretic peptide variables), excluding tomographic imaging variables. Survival analysis tested associations between predicted ECV and incident outcomes (death or hospitalization for heart failure). We created various sample size estimates for a hypothetical therapeutic clinical trial testing an anti-fibrotic therapy using: a) predicted ECV, b) measured ECV, or c) no ECV. ResultsMultivariable models predicting ECV had reasonable discrimination (optimism corrected C-statistic for predicted ECV [\u0026ge;]27% 0.78 (95%CI 90.75-0.80) in the derivation cohort (n=1663) and 0.74 (95%CI 0.71-0.76) in the validation cohort (n=1578)) and reasonable calibration. Predicted ECV associated with adverse outcomes in Cox regression models: ECV [\u0026ge;]27% (binary variable) HR 2.21 (1.84-2.66). For a hypothetical clinical trial with an inclusion criterion of ECV [\u0026ge;]27%, use of predicted ECV (with probability threshold of 0.69 and 80% specificity) compared to measured ECV would obviate the need to perform 3940 CMR scans, at the cost of an additional 3052 participants screened and 705 participants enrolled. ConclusionsPredicted ECV (derived without tomographic imaging) associates with outcomes and efficiently identifies vulnerable patients who might benefit from treatment. Predicted ECV may foster the design of phase 3 trials targeting MF with higher numbers of screened and enrolled participants, but with simplified eligibility criteria, avoiding the complexity of tomographic imaging.

Key FindingPredicted ECV had reasonable discrimination and associated with outcomes. For a hypothetical trial with an ECV [\u0026ge;]27% inclusion criterion, using predicted ECV versus measured ECV would avoid 3940 cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scans, but require an additional 3052 participants screened and 705 enrolled.

E.; Barinas-Mitchell, E.; Scudder, M. R.; Kamarck, T. W.; Sentis, A. I.; Leckie, R. L.; Gianaros, P. J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.24302236\nBackgroundCardiovascular responses to psychological stressors have been separately associated with preclinical atherosclerosis and hemodynamic brain activity patterns across different studies and cohorts; however, what has not been established is whether cardiovascular stress responses reliably link indicators of stressor-evoked brain activity and preclinical atherosclerosis that have been measured in the same individuals. Accordingly, the present study used cross-validation and predictive modeling to test for the first time whether stressor-evoked systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses statistically mediated the association between concurrently measured brain activity and a vascular marker of preclinical atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries. Methods624 midlife adults (aged 28-56 years, 54.97% female) from two different cohorts underwent two information-conflict fMRI tasks, with concurrent SBP measures collected. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) was measured by ultrasonography. A mediation framework that included harmonization, cross-validation, and penalized principal component regression was then employed, while significant areas in possible direct and indirect effects were identified through bootstrapping. Sensitivity analysis further tested the robustness of findings after accounting for prevailing levels of cardiovascular disease risk and brain imaging data quality control. ResultsTask-averaged patterns of hemodynamic brain responses exhibited a generalizable association with CA-IMT, which was mediated by an area-under-the-curve measure of aggregate SBP reactivity. Importantly, this effect held in sensitivity analyses. Implicated brain areas in this mediation included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula and amygdala. ConclusionsThese novel findings support a link between stressor-evoked brain activity and preclinical atherosclerosis accounted for by individual differences in corresponding levels of stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity.\nProspective Clinical Evaluation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Guided Point-of-Care Ultrasonography Screening of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\nAuthors: Chiu, I.-M.; Chen, T.-Y.; Zheng, Y.-C.; Lin, X.-H.; Cheng, F.-J.; Ouyang, D.; Cheng, C.-Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.24302423\nBackgroundAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a critical condition that can lead to fatal consequences if not detected and treated early. Despite the high prevalence in smokers and guideline recommendation for screening, AAA often remains undetected due to availability of diagnostic ultrasound examinations. This prospective clinical trial aimed to investigate the use of a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm to guide AAA screening. MethodsThis prospective, comparative diagnostic study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We developed and deployed an object detection-based DL algorithm providing real-time guidance for novice users performing AAA screening using point of care ultrasound. 10 registered nurses with no prior ultrasonography experience were recruited and performed at least 15 scans on patients over 65 years old to acquire abdominal aorta videos. These scans were compared with those of physicians using the same ultrasound hardware but without DL guidance. ResultsA total of 184 patients (median [IQR] age of 72 [67-79], and 105 (57.1%) male) completed this study. The DL-guided novices achieved adequate scan quality in 87.5% (95% CI: 82.7 - 92.3%) of patients, comparable to the 91.3% (95% CI: 87.2-95.4%) rate of physician scans (p=0.310). This performance did not vary by BMI. The DL model predicted AAA with an AUC of 0.975, showing 100% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity. The DL model predicted the maximal width of abdominal aorta with mean absolute error of 2.8mm compared to physician measurements. 3 AAA with maximal width of aorta \u003e 3cm were found in this study cohort. ConclusionDL-guided POCUS is an effective tool for AAA screening, providing comparable performance to experienced physicians. The use of this DL system could democratize AAA screening and improve access, thereby aiding in early disease detection and treatment. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is NewC_ST_ABSO_LIOur study presents a deep learning (DL) guidance system that enables novice users to perform Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening with POCUS, yielding image quality comparable to experienced physicians. C_LIO_LIThe DL algorithm accurately identifies AAA from scans conducted by novice users, maintains consistent performance across patients with varying BMIs, and demonstrates increased scan efficiency with repeated use. C_LI Clinical ImplicationsO_LIDL-guided POCUS can potentially expand AAA screening capabilities to non-specialist settings and increase throughput for screening at risk individuals. C_LIO_LIThe implementation of our DL model for AAA screening could enhance early detection, particularly in underserved areas, but also optimize clinical workflows by decreasing diagnostic wait times and increasing ultrasound utilization efficiency.

J.; Poterucha, T.; Haggerty, C.; Ouyang, D.; Ashley, E.; Zou, J.; Perez, M. V.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.24302412\nImportanceDeep learning methods have recently gained success in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from electrocardiogram waveforms. Despite their impressive accuracy, they are difficult to interpret and deploy broadly in the clinical setting. ObjectiveTo determine whether simpler models based on standard electrocardiogram measurements could detect LVSD with similar accuracy to deep learning models. DesignUsing an observational dataset of 40,994 matched 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and transthoracic echocardiograms, we trained a range of models with increasing complexity to detect LVSD based on ECG waveforms and derived measurements. We additionally evaluated models in two independent cohorts from different medical centers, vendors, and countries. SettingThe training data was acquired from Stanford University Medical Center. External validation data was acquired from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the UK Biobank. ExposuresThe performance of models based on ECG waveforms in their detection of LVSD, as defined by ejection fraction below 35%. Main outcomesThe performance of the models as measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and other measures of classification accuracy. ResultsThe Stanford dataset consisted of 40,994 matched ECGs and echocardiograms, the test set having an average age of 62.13 (17.61) and 55.20% Male patients, of which 9.72% had LVSD. We found that a random forest model using 555 discrete, automated measurements achieves an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (0.91-0.93), similar to a deep learning waveform model with an AUC of 0.94 (0.93-0.94). Furthermore, a linear model based on 5 measurements achieves high performance (AUC of 0.86 (0.85-0.87)), close to a deep learning model and better than NT-proBNP (0.77 (0.74-0.79)). Finally, we find that simpler models generalize better to other sites, with experiments at two independent, external sites. ConclusionOur study demonstrates the value of simple electrocardiographic models which perform nearly as well as deep learning models while being much easier to implement and interpret.\nHigh Throughput Deep Learning Detection of Mitral Regurgitation\nAuthors: Vrudhula, A.; Duffy, G.; Vukadinovic, M.; Liang, D.; Cheng, S.; Ouyang, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.24302547\nBackground: Diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) requires careful evaluation of echocardiography with Doppler imaging. This study presents the development and validation of a fully automated deep learning pipeline for identifying apical-4-chamber view videos with color Doppler and detection of clinically significant (moderate or severe) mitral regurgitation from transthoracic echocardiography studies. Methods: A total of 58,614 studies (2,587,538 videos) from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) were used to develop and test an automated pipeline to identify apical-4-chamber view videos with color Doppler across the mitral valve and then assess mitral valve regurgitation severity. The model was tested on an internal test set of 1,800 studies (80,833 videos) from CSMC and externally evaluated in a geographically distinct cohort of 915 studies (46,890 videos) from Stanford Healthcare (SHC). Results: In the held-out CSMC test set, the view classifier demonstrated an AUC of 0.998 (0.998 - 0.999) and correctly identified 3,452 of 3,539 MR color Doppler videos (sensitivity of 0.975 (0.968-0.982) and specificity of 0.999 (0.999-0.999) compared with manually curated videos). In the external test cohort from SHC, the view classifier correctly identified 1,051 of 1,055 MR color Doppler videos (sensitivity of 0.996 (0.990 ? 1.000) and specificity of 0.999 (0.999 ? 0.999) compared with manually curated videos). For evaluating clinically significant MR, in the CSMC test cohort, moderate-or-severe MR was detected with AUC of 0.916 (0.899 - 0.932) and severe MR was detected with an AUC of 0.934 (0.913 - 0.953). In the SHC test cohort, the model detected moderate-or-severe MR with an AUC of 0.951 (0.924 - 0.973) and severe MR with an AUC of 0.969 (0.946 - 0.987). Conclusions: In this study, we developed and validated an automated pipeline for identifying clinically significant MR from transthoracic echocardiography studies. Such an approach has potential for automated screening of MR and precision evaluation for surveillance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsPhase 3 trials testing whether pharmacologic interventions targeting myocardial fibrosis (MF) improve outcomes require MF measurement that does not rely on tomographic imaging with intravenous contrast.

MethodsWe developed and externally validated extracellular volume (ECV) prediction models incorporating readily available data (comorbidity and natriuretic peptide variables), excluding tomographic imaging variables. Survival analysis tested associations between predicted ECV and incident outcomes (death or hospitalization for heart failure). We created various sample size estimates for a hypothetical therapeutic clinical trial testing an anti-fibrotic therapy using: a) predicted ECV, b) measured ECV, or c) no ECV.

ResultsMultivariable models predicting ECV had reasonable discrimination (optimism corrected C-statistic for predicted ECV [&amp;ge;]27% 0.78 (95%CI 90.75-0.80) in the derivation cohort (n=1663) and 0.74 (95%CI 0.71-0.76) in the validation cohort (n=1578)) and reasonable calibration. Predicted ECV associated with adverse outcomes in Cox regression models: ECV [&amp;ge;]27% (binary variable) HR 2.21 (1.84-2.66). For a hypothetical clinical trial with an inclusion criterion of ECV [&amp;ge;]27%, use of predicted ECV (with probability threshold of 0.69 and 80% specificity) compared to measured ECV would obviate the need to perform 3940 CMR scans, at the cost of an additional 3052 participants screened and 705 participants enrolled.

ConclusionsPredicted ECV (derived without tomographic imaging) associates with outcomes and efficiently identifies vulnerable patients who might benefit from treatment. Predicted ECV may foster the design of phase 3 trials targeting MF with higher numbers of screened and enrolled participants, but with simplified eligibility criteria, avoiding the complexity of tomographic imaging.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiovascular responses to psychological stressors have been separately associated with preclinical atherosclerosis and hemodynamic brain activity patterns across different studies and cohorts; however, what has not been established is whether cardiovascular stress responses reliably link indicators of stressor-evoked brain activity and preclinical atherosclerosis that have been measured in the same individuals. Accordingly, the present study used cross-validation and predictive modeling to test for the first time whether stressor-evoked systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses statistically mediated the association between concurrently measured brain activity and a vascular marker of preclinical atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries.

Methods624 midlife adults (aged 28-56 years, 54.97% female) from two different cohorts underwent two information-conflict fMRI tasks, with concurrent SBP measures collected. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) was measured by ultrasonography. A mediation framework that included harmonization, cross-validation, and penalized principal component regression was then employed, while significant areas in possible direct and indirect effects were identified through bootstrapping. Sensitivity analysis further tested the robustness of findings after accounting for prevailing levels of cardiovascular disease risk and brain imaging data quality control.

ResultsTask-averaged patterns of hemodynamic brain responses exhibited a generalizable association with CA-IMT, which was mediated by an area-under-the-curve measure of aggregate SBP reactivity. Importantly, this effect held in sensitivity analyses. Implicated brain areas in this mediation included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula and amygdala.

ConclusionsThese novel findings support a link between stressor-evoked brain activity and preclinical atherosclerosis accounted for by individual differences in corresponding levels of stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a critical condition that can lead to fatal consequences if not detected and treated early. Despite the high prevalence in smokers and guideline recommendation for screening, AAA often remains undetected due to availability of diagnostic ultrasound examinations. This prospective clinical trial aimed to investigate the use of a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm to guide AAA screening.

MethodsThis prospective, comparative diagnostic study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We developed and deployed an object detection-based DL algorithm providing real-time guidance for novice users performing AAA screening using point of care ultrasound. 10 registered nurses with no prior ultrasonography experience were recruited and performed at least 15 scans on patients over 65 years old to acquire abdominal aorta videos. These scans were compared with those of physicians using the same ultrasound hardware but without DL guidance.

ResultsA total of 184 patients (median [IQR] age of 72 [67-79], and 105 (57.1%) male) completed this study. The DL-guided novices achieved adequate scan quality in 87.5% (95% CI: 82.7 - 92.3%) of patients, comparable to the 91.3% (95% CI: 87.2-95.4%) rate of physician scans (p=0.310). This performance did not vary by BMI. The DL model predicted AAA with an AUC of 0.975, showing 100% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity. The DL model predicted the maximal width of abdominal aorta with mean absolute error of 2.8mm compared to physician measurements. 3 AAA with maximal width of aorta &gt; 3cm were found in this study cohort.

ConclusionDL-guided POCUS is an effective tool for AAA screening, providing comparable performance to experienced physicians. The use of this DL system could democratize AAA screening and improve access, thereby aiding in early disease detection and treatment.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is NewC_ST_ABSO_LIOur study presents a deep learning (DL) guidance system that enables novice users to perform Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening with POCUS, yielding image quality comparable to experienced physicians.
C_LIO_LIThe DL algorithm accurately identifies AAA from scans conducted by novice users, maintains consistent performance across patients with varying BMIs, and demonstrates increased scan efficiency with repeated use.

Clinical ImplicationsO_LIDL-guided POCUS can potentially expand AAA screening capabilities to non-specialist settings and increase throughput for screening at risk individuals.
C_LIO_LIThe implementation of our DL model for AAA screening could enhance early detection, particularly in underserved areas, but also optimize clinical workflows by decreasing diagnostic wait times and increasing ultrasound utilization efficiency.

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceDeep learning methods have recently gained success in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from electrocardiogram waveforms. Despite their impressive accuracy, they are difficult to interpret and deploy broadly in the clinical setting.

ObjectiveTo determine whether simpler models based on standard electrocardiogram measurements could detect LVSD with similar accuracy to deep learning models.

DesignUsing an observational dataset of 40,994 matched 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and transthoracic echocardiograms, we trained a range of models with increasing complexity to detect LVSD based on ECG waveforms and derived measurements. We additionally evaluated models in two independent cohorts from different medical centers, vendors, and countries.

SettingThe training data was acquired from Stanford University Medical Center. External validation data was acquired from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the UK Biobank.

ExposuresThe performance of models based on ECG waveforms in their detection of LVSD, as defined by ejection fraction below 35%.

Main outcomesThe performance of the models as measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and other measures of classification accuracy.

ResultsThe Stanford dataset consisted of 40,994 matched ECGs and echocardiograms, the test set having an average age of 62.13 (17.61) and 55.20% Male patients, of which 9.72% had LVSD. We found that a random forest model using 555 discrete, automated measurements achieves an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (0.91-0.93), similar to a deep learning waveform model with an AUC of 0.94 (0.93-0.94). Furthermore, a linear model based on 5 measurements achieves high performance (AUC of 0.86 (0.85-0.87)), close to a deep learning model and better than NT-proBNP (0.77 (0.74-0.79)). Finally, we find that simpler models generalize better to other sites, with experiments at two independent, external sites.

ConclusionOur study demonstrates the value of simple electrocardiographic models which perform nearly as well as deep learning models while being much easier to implement and interpret.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) requires careful evaluation of echocardiography with Doppler imaging. This study presents the development and validation of a fully automated deep learning pipeline for identifying apical-4-chamber view videos with color Doppler and detection of clinically significant (moderate or severe) mitral regurgitation from transthoracic echocardiography studies. Methods: A total of 58,614 studies (2,587,538 videos) from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) were used to develop and test an automated pipeline to identify apical-4-chamber view videos with color Doppler across the mitral valve and then assess mitral valve regurgitation severity. The model was tested on an internal test set of 1,800 studies (80,833 videos) from CSMC and externally evaluated in a geographically distinct cohort of 915 studies (46,890 videos) from Stanford Healthcare (SHC). Results: In the held-out CSMC test set, the view classifier demonstrated an AUC of 0.998 (0.998 - 0.999) and correctly identified 3,452 of 3,539 MR color Doppler videos (sensitivity of 0.975 (0.968-0.982) and specificity of 0.999 (0.999-0.999) compared with manually curated videos). In the external test cohort from SHC, the view classifier correctly identified 1,051 of 1,055 MR color Doppler videos (sensitivity of 0.996 (0.990 ? 1.000) and specificity of 0.999 (0.999 ? 0.999) compared with manually curated videos). For evaluating clinically significant MR, in the CSMC test cohort, moderate-or-severe MR was detected with AUC of 0.916 (0.899 - 0.932) and severe MR was detected with an AUC of 0.934 (0.913 - 0.953). In the SHC test cohort, the model detected moderate-or-severe MR with an AUC of 0.951 (0.924 - 0.973) and severe MR with an AUC of 0.969 (0.946 - 0.987). Conclusions: In this study, we developed and validated an automated pipeline for identifying clinically significant MR from transthoracic echocardiography studies. Such an approach has potential for automated screening of MR and precision evaluation for surveillance.</p>
