This study developed ChineseCVD, first-in-world web-based Chinese-specific Cardiovascular Risk Calculator incorporating long COVID, COVID-19 vaccination, SGLT2i and PCSK9i treatment effects. Methods: Adult patients attending government-funded family medicine clinics in Hong Kong between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003 were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attacks/ischaemic strokes, and cardiovascular mortality. Results: A total of 155,066 patients were used as the derivation cohort. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) had MACE. Cox regression identified male gender, age, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and laboratory test results (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL) as significant predictors of the above outcomes. ChineseCVD further incorporates the impact of smoking status, COVID-19 infection, number of COVID-19 vaccination doses, and modifier effects of newest medication classes of PCSK9i and SGLT2i. The calculator enables clinicians to demonstrate to patients how risks vary with different medications. Conclusions: The ChineseCVD risk calculator enables rapid web-based risk assessment for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making at the bedside or in the clinic.\nEchocardiographic characterisation in severe Covid-19 with respiratory failure - an observational study.\nAuthors: Isackson, H.; Larsson, A.; Lipcsey, M.; Frithiof, R.; Flachskampf, F.; Hultstrom, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297666\nObjective: We aimed to investigate cardiac effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of echocardiography-assessment and biomarkers. Methods: This is an observational study of the first patients admitted to intensive care due to SARS-CoV-2-respiratory failure. Thirty-four underwent echocardiography of which twenty-five were included, compared to forty-four non-echo patients. Exclusion was based on absence of normofrequent sinus rhythm and/or mechanical respiratory support. Biomarkers were analysed on clinical indication. Results: Mortality was higher in the echo- compared to non-echo group (44 % vs. 16%, p\u003c0.05). Right-sided parameters were not under significant strain. Tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicated how increased pulmonary pressure was associated with mortality (survivors: 2.51 +/- 0.01 m/s vs. non-survivors: 3.06 +/- 0.11 m/s, p\u003c0.05), before multiple comparison-correction. Setting cut-off for pulmonary hypertension to 2.8 m/s generated p\u003c0.01 using frequency distribution testing. Cardiac markers, high sensitivity cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were higher in the echocardiography group. (hs-TnI (ng/L): echo : 133 +/- 45 vs. non-echo: 81.3 +/- 45, p\u003c0.01; NT-proBNP (ng/L): echo: 2959 +/- 573 vs. non-echo: 1641 +/- 420, p\u003c0.001; D-dimer (mg/L): echo: 16.1 +/- 3.7 vs. non-echo: 6.1 +/- 1.5, p\u003c0.01) and non-survivor group (hs-TnI (ng/L): survivors: 59.1 +/- 21 vs. non-survivors: 211 +/- 105, p\u003c0.0001; NT-proBNP (ng/L): survivors: 1310 +/- 314 vs. non-survivors: 4065 +/- 740, p\u003c0.0001; D-dimer (mg/L): survivors: 7.2 +/- 1.5 vs. non-survivors: 17.1 +/- 4.8, p\u003c0.01). Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was positively correlated with cardiac troponin I (r=0.93, r2=0.74, p\u003c0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest there is no negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary pressure appears higher amongst non-survivors indicating pulmonary disease as the driver of mortality. Echocardiography was more commonly performed in the non-survivor group, and cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer was higher in the non-survivor group suggesting they carry negative prognostic values.\nMapping the aetiological foundations of the heart failure spectrum using human genetics\nAuthors: Henry, A.; Mo, X.; Finan, C.; Chaffin, M. D.; Speed, D.; Issa, H.; Denaxas, S.; Ware, J. S.; Zheng, S. L.; Malarstig, A.; Gratton, J.; Bond, I.; Roselli, C.; Miller, D.; Chopade, S.; Schmidt, A.

P.; Czuba, T.; de Denus, S.; Dehghan, A.; Delgado, G. E.; Doney, A\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296379\nSummary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment.\nDeep neural network for identification of impaired microvascular and vasomotor function from stress electrocardiography\nAuthors: Moody, J. B.; Poitrasson-Riviere, A.; Renaud, J. M.; Hagio, T.; Alahdab, F.; Al-Mallah, M. H.; Vanderver, M. D.; Ficaro, E. P.; Murthy, V. L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297552\nBackgroundImpaired microvascular and vasomotor function is a common consequence of aging, diabetes, and other risk factors, and is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes. Such impairments are not readily identified by standard clinical methods of cardiovascular testing such as coronary angiography and noninvasive single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). We hypothesized that signals embedded within stress electrocardiograms (ECGs) identify individuals with microvascular and vasomotor dysfunction. MethodsWe developed and validated a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) using stress and rest ECG data (ECG-Flow) to identify patients with impaired myocardial flow reserve (MFR) on quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) MPI (N=3887). Diagnostic accuracy was validated with an internal holdout set of patients undergoing stress PET MPI (N=963). The prognostic association of ECG-Flow with mortality was then evaluated in a separate cohort of patients undergoing SPECT MPI (N=5102). ResultsECG-Flow achieved good diagnostic accuracy for impaired MFR in the holdout PET cohort (AUC, sensitivity, specificity: 0.737, 71.1%, 65.7%). Abnormal ECG-Flow was found to be significantly associated with mortality in both PET holdout and SPECT MPI cohorts (adjusted HR 2.12 [95{rho} CI 1.45, 2.10],{rho} = 0.0001, and 2.07 [1.82, 2.36],{rho} \u003c 0.0001, respectively). ConclusionSignals predictive of microvascular and vasomotor dysfunction are embedded in stress ECG waveforms. These signals can be identified by deep learning methods and are related to prognosis in patients undergoing both stress PET and SPECT MPI.\nLongitudinal Associations of Dietary Fructose and Psychological Stress with Vascular Aging Index and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the CARDIA Cohort\nAuthors: Osborne, M.; Bernard, A.; Falkowski, E.; Peterson, D.; Vavilikolanu, A.; Komnenov, D.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296515\nBackgroundCardiovascular disease (CVD) risk increases exponentially with age, largely due to vascular aging. We explored how dietary behaviors (sucrose, fructose, sodium, and potassium consumption) and endured psychological stress in young adult males and females impact the vascular aging index (VAI) and CVD risk by mid-life. MethodsData were obtained from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, an ongoing longitudinal study. Included participants (n=2,656) had undergone carotid artery ultrasound Doppler scans at year 20 allowing VAIs to be calculated. Demographics, dietary data and depression scale scores were obtained at the initial visit. Regression analyses were used to assess the predictors of VAI 20 years later. Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD, hypertensive CVD, and stroke. ResultsPredictors of vascular aging were found to be sex-specific. In females, CES-D scores at baseline were positively associated with VAI (B-weight=0.063, p=0.015). In males, sodium intake at year 20 positively predicted VAI (B-weight=0.145, p=0.003) and potassium intake inversely predicted VAI (B-weight=-0.160, p\u003c0.001). On Cox regression analyses, BMI significantly predicted CVD, stroke, and death. In addition, fructose consumption at year 20 was a significant predictor of CVD risk while having blood pressure above 130/80 mmHg at baseline was significantly associated with stroke risk. ConclusionOur findings support the promotion of nutrient-specific behavior changes (specifically, limiting fructose consumption) to prevent vascular aging in early adulthood and CVD risk in mid-life.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Web-based risk prediction tools for cardiovascular diseases are crucial for providing rapid risk estimates for busy clinicians, but there is none available specifically for Chinese subjects. This study developed ChineseCVD, first-in-world web-based Chinese-specific Cardiovascular Risk Calculator incorporating long COVID, COVID-19 vaccination, SGLT2i and PCSK9i treatment effects. Methods: Adult patients attending government-funded family medicine clinics in Hong Kong between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003 were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attacks/ischaemic strokes, and cardiovascular mortality. Results: A total of 155,066 patients were used as the derivation cohort. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) had MACE. Cox regression identified male gender, age, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and laboratory test results (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL) as significant predictors of the above outcomes. ChineseCVD further incorporates the impact of smoking status, COVID-19 infection, number of COVID-19 vaccination doses, and modifier effects of newest medication classes of PCSK9i and SGLT2i. The calculator enables clinicians to demonstrate to patients how risks vary with different medications. Conclusions: The ChineseCVD risk calculator enables rapid web-based risk assessment for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making at the bedside or in the clinic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: We aimed to investigate cardiac effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of echocardiography-assessment and biomarkers. Methods: This is an observational study of the first patients admitted to intensive care due to SARS-CoV-2-respiratory failure. Thirty-four underwent echocardiography of which twenty-five were included, compared to forty-four non-echo patients. Exclusion was based on absence of normofrequent sinus rhythm and/or mechanical respiratory support. Biomarkers were analysed on clinical indication. Results: Mortality was higher in the echo- compared to non-echo group (44 % vs. 16%, p&lt;0.05). Right-sided parameters were not under significant strain. Tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicated how increased pulmonary pressure was associated with mortality (survivors: 2.51 &#43;/- 0.01 m/s vs. non-survivors: 3.06 &#43;/- 0.11 m/s, p&lt;0.05), before multiple comparison-correction. Setting cut-off for pulmonary hypertension to 2.8 m/s generated p&lt;0.01 using frequency distribution testing. Cardiac markers, high sensitivity cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were higher in the echocardiography group. (hs-TnI (ng/L): echo : 133 &#43;/- 45 vs. non-echo: 81.3 &#43;/- 45, p&lt;0.01; NT-proBNP (ng/L): echo: 2959 &#43;/- 573 vs. non-echo: 1641 &#43;/- 420, p&lt;0.001; D-dimer (mg/L): echo: 16.1 &#43;/- 3.7 vs. non-echo: 6.1 &#43;/- 1.5, p&lt;0.01) and non-survivor group (hs-TnI (ng/L): survivors: 59.1 &#43;/- 21 vs. non-survivors: 211 &#43;/- 105, p&lt;0.0001; NT-proBNP (ng/L): survivors: 1310 &#43;/- 314 vs. non-survivors: 4065 &#43;/- 740, p&lt;0.0001; D-dimer (mg/L): survivors: 7.2 &#43;/- 1.5 vs. non-survivors: 17.1 &#43;/- 4.8, p&lt;0.01). Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was positively correlated with cardiac troponin I (r=0.93, r2=0.74, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest there is no negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary pressure appears higher amongst non-survivors indicating pulmonary disease as the driver of mortality. Echocardiography was more commonly performed in the non-survivor group, and cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer was higher in the non-survivor group suggesting they carry negative prognostic values.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundImpaired microvascular and vasomotor function is a common consequence of aging, diabetes, and other risk factors, and is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes. Such impairments are not readily identified by standard clinical methods of cardiovascular testing such as coronary angiography and noninvasive single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). We hypothesized that signals embedded within stress electrocardiograms (ECGs) identify individuals with microvascular and vasomotor dysfunction.

MethodsWe developed and validated a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) using stress and rest ECG data (ECG-Flow) to identify patients with impaired myocardial flow reserve (MFR) on quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) MPI (N=3887). Diagnostic accuracy was validated with an internal holdout set of patients undergoing stress PET MPI (N=963). The prognostic association of ECG-Flow with mortality was then evaluated in a separate cohort of patients undergoing SPECT MPI (N=5102).

ResultsECG-Flow achieved good diagnostic accuracy for impaired MFR in the holdout PET cohort (AUC, sensitivity, specificity: 0.737, 71.1%, 65.7%). Abnormal ECG-Flow was found to be significantly associated with mortality in both PET holdout and SPECT MPI cohorts (adjusted HR 2.12 [95{rho} CI 1.45, 2.10],{rho} = 0.0001, and 2.07 [1.82, 2.36],{rho} &lt; 0.0001, respectively).

ConclusionSignals predictive of microvascular and vasomotor dysfunction are embedded in stress ECG waveforms. These signals can be identified by deep learning methods and are related to prognosis in patients undergoing both stress PET and SPECT MPI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCardiovascular disease (CVD) risk increases exponentially with age, largely due to vascular aging. We explored how dietary behaviors (sucrose, fructose, sodium, and potassium consumption) and endured psychological stress in young adult males and females impact the vascular aging index (VAI) and CVD risk by mid-life.

MethodsData were obtained from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, an ongoing longitudinal study. Included participants (n=2,656) had undergone carotid artery ultrasound Doppler scans at year 20 allowing VAIs to be calculated. Demographics, dietary data and depression scale scores were obtained at the initial visit. Regression analyses were used to assess the predictors of VAI 20 years later. Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD, hypertensive CVD, and stroke.

ResultsPredictors of vascular aging were found to be sex-specific. In females, CES-D scores at baseline were positively associated with VAI (B-weight=0.063, p=0.015). In males, sodium intake at year 20 positively predicted VAI (B-weight=0.145, p=0.003) and potassium intake inversely predicted VAI (B-weight=-0.160, p&lt;0.001). On Cox regression analyses, BMI significantly predicted CVD, stroke, and death. In addition, fructose consumption at year 20 was a significant predictor of CVD risk while having blood pressure above 130/80 mmHg at baseline was significantly associated with stroke risk.

ConclusionOur findings support the promotion of nutrient-specific behavior changes (specifically, limiting fructose consumption) to prevent vascular aging in early adulthood and CVD risk in mid-life.</p>
