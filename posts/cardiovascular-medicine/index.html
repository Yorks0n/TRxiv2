Given the slow pace and substantial costs of developing new therapeutics, drug repurposing is an attractive alternative. Studies of many organs, including the heart, highlight the importance of the immune system in modulating injury and repair outcomes. Glatiramer-acetate (GA) is an immunomodulatory drug prescribed for patients with multiple sclerosis. Here we report that short-term GA treatment improves cardiac function and reduces scar area in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction, as well as in a rat model of ischemic HF. We provide both in vivo and in vitro mechanistic evidence indicating that in addition to its immunomodulatory functions, GA exerts beneficial pleiotropic effects, including cardiomyocyte protection and enhanced angiogenesis, mediated partially by extracellular vesicles carrying a pro-reparative cargo. Finally, as GA is a widely used drug with established efficacy and safety history, we conducted a small, prospective, randomized trial to determine its effect on patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Strikingly, a short-term add-on administration of GA, resulted in marked reduction in the cytokine surge and NT-proBNP levels, both associated with acute HF exacerbations. Overall, these findings demonstrate the efficacy of GA in attenuating acute myocardial injury and modulating the inflammatory process in animal models and humans and highlight the potential of GA as a future therapy for a myriad of heart diseases. One Sentence SummaryGlatiramer acetate promotes reparative processes in rodent models of cardiac injury and reduces the inflammatory process in ADHF patients.\nMapping the aetiological foundations of the heart failure spectrum using human genetics\nAuthors: Henry, A.; Mo, X.; Finan, C.; Chaffin, M. D.; Speed, D.; Issa, H.; Denaxas, S.; Ware, J. S.; Zheng, S. L.; Malarstig, A.; Gratton, J.; Bond, I.; Roselli, C.; Miller, D.; Chopade, S.; Schmidt, A.

P.; Czuba, T.; de Denus, S.; Dehghan, A.; Delgado, G. E.; Doney, A\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296379\nSummary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment.\nPowerAI-CVD - the first Chinese-specific, validated artificial intelligence-powered in-silico predictive model for cardiovascular disease\nAuthors: Li, L.; Chou, O. H. I.; Lu, L.; Pui, H. H. H.; Lee, Q.; Kaur, N.; Wong, W. T.; Chang, C.; Liu, H.; Wai, A. K. C.; Cheung, B. M. Y.; Liu, T.; Tse, G.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296722\nBackground: The main risk stratification tools for identifying high-risk individuals of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are based on Western populations. Few models are developed specifically for Asian populations and are not enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this study is to develop the first AI-powered quantitative predictive tool for CVD (PowerAI-CVD) incorporate physiological blood pressure measurements, existing diseases and medications, and laboratory tests from Chinese patients. Methods: The study analysed patients who attended family medicine clinics between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke or cardiovascular mortality, with follow-up until 31st December 2019. The performance of AI-driven models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, AdaBoost, SVM-Sigmod) for predicting MACE was compared. Predicted probability (ranging between 0 and 1) of the best model (CatBoost) was used as the baseline in-silico marker to predict future MACE events during follow-up. Results: A total of 154,569 patients were included. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) suffered from MACE (annualised risk: 1.28%). The machine learning in-silico marker captured MACE risk from established risk variables (sex, age, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, existing cardiovascular diseases, medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, antihypertensive drugs, and statins) and laboratory tests (NLR, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL)). MACE incidences increased quantitatively with ascending quartiles of the in-silico marker. The CatBoost model showed the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. The CatBoost model based in-silico marker shows significant prediction strength for future MACE events, across subgroups (age, sex, prior MACE, etc) and different follow-up durations. Conclusions: The AI-powered risk prediction tool can accurately forecast incident CVD events, allowing personalised risk prediction at the individual level. A dashboard for predictive analytics was developed, allowing real-time dynamic updates of risk estimates from new data. It can be easily incorporated into routine clinical use to aid clinicians and healthcare administrators to identify high-risk patients.\nIdentification of EPHB4 variants in dilated cardiomyopathy patients\nAuthors: Luxan, G.; Muhly-Reinholz, M.; Glaser, S. F.; Trebing, J.; Reich, C.; Haas, J.; Sedaghat-Hamedani, F.; Meder, B.; Dimmeler, S.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.16.22283442\nCardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch5 Pro and Withings Body+ generate electrical interference on CRT-Ds\nAuthors: Hansen, N.; Ha, G. B.; Colvin, P. R. T.; Freedman, R.; Bayes-Genis, A.; Steinberg, B. A.; Sanchez Terrones, B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296573\nSmart consumer devices with bioimpedance sensing technology apply an electrical current to the body for health and wellness. However, whether these smart devices interfere with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remains unknown. We report electrical interference with benchtop testing from the Galaxy Watch5 Pro and smart scale Body+ to cardiac resynchronization therapy device generators from different manufacturers. These results highlight the need of establishing standard testing procedures to assess the safety of smart devices with bioimpedance sensing in patients with CIEDs.\nCardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in a Prospective Multicenter Cohort of Older Adults: The Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA)\nAuthors: Wolf, C.; Blackwell, T. L.; Johnson, E.; Glynn, N. W.; Nicklas, B. J.; Kritchevsky, S. B.; Carnero, E. A.; Cawthon, P.; Cummings, S. C.; Toledo, F. G. S.; Newman, A. B.; Forman, D. E.; Goodpaster, B. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296120\nBACKGROUNDCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) has long been the criterion method to assess CRF, but its feasibility, efficacy and reliability in older adults is unclear. The large, multicenter Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) employed CPET to evaluate the mechanisms underlying declines in mobility with aging among community-dwelling older adults. Our primary objective was to design and implement a CPET protocol in older adults that was dependable, safe, scientifically valuable, and methodologically reliable. METHODSCPET was performed using treadmill exercise in 875 adults [\u0026ge;]70 years. A composite protocol included a symptom-limited peak exercise phase and two submaximal phases to assess cardiopulmonary ventilatory indices during 1) participants preferred walking speed and 2) at slow walking speed of 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s). An adjudication process was in place to review tests for validity if they met any prespecified criteria (VO2peak \u003c12.0 ml/kg/min; maximum heart rate (HR) \u003c100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio (RER) \u003c1.05 and a rating of perceived exertion \u003c15). A repeat test was performed in a subset (N=30) to assess reproducibility. RESULTSCPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to complete the VO2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a risk alert during any phase of testing and only two adverse events occurred during the peak phase: a fall and atrial fibrillation. The average {+/-} standard deviation for VO2peak was 20.2 {+/-} 4.8 mL/kg/min, peak HR 142 {+/-} 18 bpm, and peak RER 1.14 {+/-} 0.09. VO2peak and RER were slightly higher in men than women. Adjudication was indicated in 47 participants; 20 were evaluated as valid, 27 as invalid (18 had a data collection error, 9 did not reach VO2peak). Reproducibility of VO2peak was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97). CONCLUSIONSCPET was feasible, effective and safe for community-dwelling older adults, many of whom had multimorbidity and frailty. These data support a broader implementation of CPET to provide important insight into the role of CRF and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSPerforming cardiopulmonary exercise testing in a community dwelling older adult with multimorbidities or frailty is feasible and exceptionally safe under highly trained exercise physiologists and physician supervision. Reproducibility of VO2peak among community-dwelling older adults with significant clinical complexity was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97). The VO2peak observed was comparable to established normative data for older adults, and adds merit to the limited data collected on VO2peak norms in older adults. What Are the Clinical Implications?Ventilatory gas collection during clinical cardiac stress testing may be valuable to plan of care in routine management of older adults due to the important role of aerobic fitness on morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide insight into the role of cardiorespiratory fitness and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.\nHeterogeneity of the Effect of Telemedicine Hypertension Management Approach on Blood Pressure: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of US-based Clinical Trials\nAuthors: Acharya, S.; Neupane, G.; Seals, A.; KC, M.; Giustini, D.; Sharma, S.; Taylor, Y. J.; Palakshappa, D.; Williamson, J. D.; Moore, J. B.; Bosworth, H.; Pokharel, Y.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295587\nBackgroundTelemedicine management of hypertension (TM-HTN) uses home blood pressure (BP) to guide pharmacotherapy and telemedicine-based self-management support (SMS). Optimal approach to implementing TM-HTN in the US is unknown. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to examine the effect of TM-HTN vs. usual clinic-based care on BP and assessed heterogeneity by patient- and clinician-related factors. We searched US-based randomized clinical trials among adults from Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Compendex, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and two trial registries to 7/7/2023. Two authors extracted, and a third author confirmed data. We used trial-level differences in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and BP control rate at [\u0026ge;]6 months using random-effects models. We examined heterogeneity of effect in univariable meta-regression and in pre-specified subgroups [clinicians leading pharmacotherapy (physician vs. non-physician), SMS (pharmacist vs. nurse), White vs. non-White patient predominant trials (\u003e50% patients/trial), diabetes predominant trials ([\u0026ge;]25% patients/trial) and in trials that have majority of both non-White patients and patients with diabetes vs. White patient predominant but not diabetes predominant trials. ResultsThirteen, 11 and 7 trials were eligible for SBP, DBP and BP control, respectively. Differences in SBP, DBP and BP control rate were -7.3 mmHg (95% CI: - 9.4, -5.2), -2.7 mmHg (-4.0, -1.5) and 10.1% (0.4%, 19.9%), respectively, favoring TM-HTN. More BP reduction occurred in trials with non-physician vs. physician led pharmacotherapy (9.3/4.0 mmHg vs. 4.9/1.1 mmHg, P\u003c0.01 for both SBP/DBP), pharmacist vs. nurses provided SMS (9.3/4.1 mmHg vs. 5.6/1.0 mmHg, P=0.01 for SBP, P\u003c0.01 for DBP), and White vs. non-White patient predominant trials (9.3/4.0 mmHg vs. 4.4/1.1 mmHg, P\u003c0.01 for both SBP/DBP), with no difference by diabetes predominant trials. Lower BP reduction occurred in both diabetes and non-White patient predominant trials vs. White patient predominant but not diabetes predominant trials (4.5/0.9 mmHg vs. 9.5/4.2 mmHg, P\u003c0.01 for both SBP/DBP). ConclusionsTM-HTN is more effective than clinic-based care in the US, particularly when non-physician led pharmacotherapy and pharmacist provided SMS. Non-White patient predominant trials seemed to achieve lesser BP reduction. Equity conscious, locally informed adaptation of TM-HTN is needed before wider implementation. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of US-based clinical trials, we found that telemedicine management of hypertension (TM-HTN) was more effective in reducing and controlling blood pressure (BP) compared with clinic based hypertension (HTN) care. C_LIO_LIThe BP reduction was more evident when pharmacotherapy was led by non-physician compared with physicians and HTN self-management support was provided by clinical pharmacists compared with nurses, C_LIO_LINon-White patient predominant trials achieved lesser BP reductions than White patient predominant trials. C_LI What Are the Clinical Implications?O_LIBefore wider implementation of TM-HTN intervention in the US, locally informed adaptation, such as optimizing the team-based HTN care approach, can provide more effective BP control. C_LIO_LIWithout equity focused tailoring, TM-HTN intervention implemented as such can exacerbate inequities in BP control among non-White patients in the US. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Myocardial injury may ultimately lead to adverse ventricular remodeling and development of heart failure (HF), which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the slow pace and substantial costs of developing new therapeutics, drug repurposing is an attractive alternative. Studies of many organs, including the heart, highlight the importance of the immune system in modulating injury and repair outcomes. Glatiramer-acetate (GA) is an immunomodulatory drug prescribed for patients with multiple sclerosis. Here we report that short-term GA treatment improves cardiac function and reduces scar area in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction, as well as in a rat model of ischemic HF. We provide both in vivo and in vitro mechanistic evidence indicating that in addition to its immunomodulatory functions, GA exerts beneficial pleiotropic effects, including cardiomyocyte protection and enhanced angiogenesis, mediated partially by extracellular vesicles carrying a pro-reparative cargo. Finally, as GA is a widely used drug with established efficacy and safety history, we conducted a small, prospective, randomized trial to determine its effect on patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Strikingly, a short-term add-on administration of GA, resulted in marked reduction in the cytokine surge and NT-proBNP levels, both associated with acute HF exacerbations. Overall, these findings demonstrate the efficacy of GA in attenuating acute myocardial injury and modulating the inflammatory process in animal models and humans and highlight the potential of GA as a future therapy for a myriad of heart diseases.

One Sentence SummaryGlatiramer acetate promotes reparative processes in rodent models of cardiac injury and reduces the inflammatory process in ADHF patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The main risk stratification tools for identifying high-risk individuals of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are based on Western populations. Few models are developed specifically for Asian populations and are not enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this study is to develop the first AI-powered quantitative predictive tool for CVD (PowerAI-CVD) incorporate physiological blood pressure measurements, existing diseases and medications, and laboratory tests from Chinese patients. Methods: The study analysed patients who attended family medicine clinics between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke or cardiovascular mortality, with follow-up until 31st December 2019. The performance of AI-driven models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, AdaBoost, SVM-Sigmod) for predicting MACE was compared. Predicted probability (ranging between 0 and 1) of the best model (CatBoost) was used as the baseline in-silico marker to predict future MACE events during follow-up. Results: A total of 154,569 patients were included. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) suffered from MACE (annualised risk: 1.28%). The machine learning in-silico marker captured MACE risk from established risk variables (sex, age, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, existing cardiovascular diseases, medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, antihypertensive drugs, and statins) and laboratory tests (NLR, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL)). MACE incidences increased quantitatively with ascending quartiles of the in-silico marker. The CatBoost model showed the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. The CatBoost model based in-silico marker shows significant prediction strength for future MACE events, across subgroups (age, sex, prior MACE, etc) and different follow-up durations. Conclusions: The AI-powered risk prediction tool can accurately forecast incident CVD events, allowing personalised risk prediction at the individual level. A dashboard for predictive analytics was developed, allowing real-time dynamic updates of risk estimates from new data. It can be easily incorporated into routine clinical use to aid clinicians and healthcare administrators to identify high-risk patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Smart consumer devices with bioimpedance sensing technology apply an electrical current to the body for health and wellness. However, whether these smart devices interfere with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remains unknown. We report electrical interference with benchtop testing from the Galaxy Watch5 Pro and smart scale Body&#43; to cardiac resynchronization therapy device generators from different manufacturers. These results highlight the need of establishing standard testing procedures to assess the safety of smart devices with bioimpedance sensing in patients with CIEDs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) has long been the criterion method to assess CRF, but its feasibility, efficacy and reliability in older adults is unclear. The large, multicenter Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) employed CPET to evaluate the mechanisms underlying declines in mobility with aging among community-dwelling older adults. Our primary objective was to design and implement a CPET protocol in older adults that was dependable, safe, scientifically valuable, and methodologically reliable.

METHODSCPET was performed using treadmill exercise in 875 adults [&amp;ge;]70 years. A composite protocol included a symptom-limited peak exercise phase and two submaximal phases to assess cardiopulmonary ventilatory indices during 1) participants preferred walking speed and 2) at slow walking speed of 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s). An adjudication process was in place to review tests for validity if they met any prespecified criteria (VO2peak &lt;12.0 ml/kg/min; maximum heart rate (HR) &lt;100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio (RER) &lt;1.05 and a rating of perceived exertion &lt;15). A repeat test was performed in a subset (N=30) to assess reproducibility.

RESULTSCPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to complete the VO2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a risk alert during any phase of testing and only two adverse events occurred during the peak phase: a fall and atrial fibrillation. The average {&#43;/-} standard deviation for VO2peak was 20.2 {&#43;/-} 4.8 mL/kg/min, peak HR 142 {&#43;/-} 18 bpm, and peak RER 1.14 {&#43;/-} 0.09. VO2peak and RER were slightly higher in men than women. Adjudication was indicated in 47 participants; 20 were evaluated as valid, 27 as invalid (18 had a data collection error, 9 did not reach VO2peak). Reproducibility of VO2peak was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97).

CONCLUSIONSCPET was feasible, effective and safe for community-dwelling older adults, many of whom had multimorbidity and frailty. These data support a broader implementation of CPET to provide important insight into the role of CRF and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSPerforming cardiopulmonary exercise testing in a community dwelling older adult with multimorbidities or frailty is feasible and exceptionally safe under highly trained exercise physiologists and physician supervision.
Reproducibility of VO2peak among community-dwelling older adults with significant clinical complexity was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97).
The VO2peak observed was comparable to established normative data for older adults, and adds merit to the limited data collected on VO2peak norms in older adults.


What Are the Clinical Implications?Ventilatory gas collection during clinical cardiac stress testing may be valuable to plan of care in routine management of older adults due to the important role of aerobic fitness on morbidity and mortality.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide insight into the role of cardiorespiratory fitness and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTelemedicine management of hypertension (TM-HTN) uses home blood pressure (BP) to guide pharmacotherapy and telemedicine-based self-management support (SMS). Optimal approach to implementing TM-HTN in the US is unknown.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to examine the effect of TM-HTN vs. usual clinic-based care on BP and assessed heterogeneity by patient- and clinician-related factors. We searched US-based randomized clinical trials among adults from Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Compendex, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and two trial registries to 7/7/2023. Two authors extracted, and a third author confirmed data. We used trial-level differences in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and BP control rate at [&amp;ge;]6 months using random-effects models. We examined heterogeneity of effect in univariable meta-regression and in pre-specified subgroups [clinicians leading pharmacotherapy (physician vs. non-physician), SMS (pharmacist vs. nurse), White vs. non-White patient predominant trials (&gt;50% patients/trial), diabetes predominant trials ([&amp;ge;]25% patients/trial) and in trials that have majority of both non-White patients and patients with diabetes vs. White patient predominant but not diabetes predominant trials.

ResultsThirteen, 11 and 7 trials were eligible for SBP, DBP and BP control, respectively. Differences in SBP, DBP and BP control rate were -7.3 mmHg (95% CI: - 9.4, -5.2), -2.7 mmHg (-4.0, -1.5) and 10.1% (0.4%, 19.9%), respectively, favoring TM-HTN. More BP reduction occurred in trials with non-physician vs. physician led pharmacotherapy (9.3/4.0 mmHg vs. 4.9/1.1 mmHg, P&lt;0.01 for both SBP/DBP), pharmacist vs. nurses provided SMS (9.3/4.1 mmHg vs. 5.6/1.0 mmHg, P=0.01 for SBP, P&lt;0.01 for DBP), and White vs. non-White patient predominant trials (9.3/4.0 mmHg vs. 4.4/1.1 mmHg, P&lt;0.01 for both SBP/DBP), with no difference by diabetes predominant trials. Lower BP reduction occurred in both diabetes and non-White patient predominant trials vs. White patient predominant but not diabetes predominant trials (4.5/0.9 mmHg vs. 9.5/4.2 mmHg, P&lt;0.01 for both SBP/DBP).

ConclusionsTM-HTN is more effective than clinic-based care in the US, particularly when non-physician led pharmacotherapy and pharmacist provided SMS. Non-White patient predominant trials seemed to achieve lesser BP reduction. Equity conscious, locally informed adaptation of TM-HTN is needed before wider implementation.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of US-based clinical trials, we found that telemedicine management of hypertension (TM-HTN) was more effective in reducing and controlling blood pressure (BP) compared with clinic based hypertension (HTN) care.
C_LIO_LIThe BP reduction was more evident when pharmacotherapy was led by non-physician compared with physicians and HTN self-management support was provided by clinical pharmacists compared with nurses,
C_LIO_LINon-White patient predominant trials achieved lesser BP reductions than White patient predominant trials.

What Are the Clinical Implications?O_LIBefore wider implementation of TM-HTN intervention in the US, locally informed adaptation, such as optimizing the team-based HTN care approach, can provide more effective BP control.
C_LIO_LIWithout equity focused tailoring, TM-HTN intervention implemented as such can exacerbate inequities in BP control among non-White patients in the US.
