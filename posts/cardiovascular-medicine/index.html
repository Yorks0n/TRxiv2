Altered metabolism plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). We aimed to identify novel plasma metabolites and proteins associating with cardiac disease. Methods. Mendelian randomisation (MR) was used to assess the association of 174 metabolites measured in up to 86,507 participants with AF, HF, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Subsequently, we sourced data on 1,567 plasma proteins and performed cis MR to identify proteins affecting the identified metabolites as well as the cardiac diseases. Proteins were prioritised on cardiac expression and druggability, and mapped to biological pathways. Results. We identified 35 metabolites associating with cardiac disease. AF was affected by seventeen metabolites, HF by nineteen, DCM by four, and NCIM by taurine. HF was particularly enriched for phosphatidylcholines (p=0.029) and DCM for acylcarnitines (p=0.001). Metabolite involvement in AF was more uniform, spanning for example phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines. We identified 38 druggable proteins expressed in cardiac tissue, with a directionally concordant effect on metabolites and cardiac disease. We recapitulated known associations, for example between the drug target of digoxin (AT1B2), taurine and NICM risk. Additionally, we identified numerous novel findings, such as higher RET values associating with phosphatidylcholines and decreasing AF and HF, and RET is targeted by drugs such as regorafenib which has known cardiotoxic side-effects. Pathway analysis implicated involvement of GDF15 signalling through RET, and ghrelin regulation of energy homeostasis in cardiac pathogenesis. Conclusion. This study identified 35 plasma metabolites involved with cardiac diseases and linked these to 38 druggable proteins, providing actionable leads for drug development.\nDerivation and validation of a non-invasive optoacoustic imaging biomarker for patients with intermittent claudication\nAuthors: Caranovic, M.; Kempf, J.; Li, Y.; Regensburger, A. P.; Guenther, J. S.; Traeger, A. P.; Lang, W.; Meyer, A.; Wagner, A. L.; Woelfle, J.; Raming, R.; Paulus, L.-P.; Buehler, A.; Uter, W.; Uder, M.; Behrendt, C.-A.; Neurath, M. F.; Waldner, M. J.; Knieling, F.; Rother, U.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297246\nBackground Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a molecular sensitive ultrasound, offers a non-invasive diagnostic approach to image the deep-tissue biomarkers. Objectives The authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of MSOT to distinguish between healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with intermittent claudication (IC) by assessing hemoglobin-related biomarkers in calf muscle tissue. Methods In this monocentric, cross-sectional diagnostic trial using derivation (DC) and validation cohorts (VC) yll subjects underwent standardized PAD diagnostics. This included pulse palpation, ankle brachial index (ABI), duplex sonography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and assessment of health-related quality of life (VASCUQOL-6). The vascular occlusion profile in IC patients was confirmed by angiography (aggregated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, aTASC). MSOT imaging of calf muscle was performed before and after standardized heel raise provocation. Participants Of 123 screened individuals, 102 completed the study. MSOT-derived oxygenation (msO2) after the exercise differentiated IC and HV with an area under curve the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) in DC by 0.99 (95%CI 0.97;1.00, p\u003c0.001, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95.8%) and in the VC by 0.95 (95%CI 0.95;1.00, p\u003c0.001, sensitivity: 96.2%, specificity: 96.0%). mSO2 positively correlated with the ABI post-exercise (R=0.83, 95%CI 0.75;0.88, P\u003c0.001), the absolute walking distance in the 6MWT (R=0.77, 95%CI 0.68;0.84, P\u003c0.001), the VASCUQOL-6 (R=0.79, 95%CI 0.70;0.85, P\u003c0.001) and negatively with aTASC classification (R=-0.80, 95%CI -0.86;-0.72, P\u003c0.001). Conclusions Post-exercise MSOT-derived saturation in the calf muscle was validated as a new and promising diagnostic biomarker to distinguish between HV and IC patients yielding high sensitivity and specificity.

C.; Rader, F.; Li, D.; Ouyang, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296510\nIncreased left ventricular mass has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes including incident cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Such associations have been studied in relation to total left ventricular hypertrophy, while the regional distribution of myocardial hypertrophy is extremely variable and the clinical significant and genetic associations of such variability requires further study. Here, we use deep learning derived phenotypes of disproportionate patterns of hypertrophy, such as apical hypertrophy and septal hypertrophy, to study genome-wide and clinical associations in addition to and independent from total left ventricular mass within 35,268 UK Biobank participants. Adjusting for total left ventricular mass, apical hypertrophy is associated with elevated risk for cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, and the risk for cardiomyopathy was increased for subjects with increased apical or septal mass even in the absence of global hypertrophy. We identified seventeen genome-wide associations for left ventricular mass, three unique associations with increased apical mass, and three additional unique associations with increased septal mass. Further studies are needed in multi-ethnic cohorts.\nComparing the effectiveness of the NHS Health Check and the Polypill Prevention Programmes in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes.\nAuthors: Wald, N. J.; Hingorani, A. D.; Vale, S.; Bestwick, J. P.; Morris, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296215\nObjectiveTo compare the NHS Health Check Programme with the Polypill Prevention Programme in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. DesignUse of published data and methodology to produce flow charts of the two programmes to determine screening performance and heart attacks and strokes prevented. SettingThe UK population. InterventionThe NHS Health Check Programme using a QRisk score on people aged 40-74 to select those eligible for a statin is compared with the Polypill Prevention programme in people aged 50 or more to select people for a combination of a statin and 3 low dose blood pressure lowering agents. In both programmes people had no history of heart attack or stroke. Main outcome measuresIn 1000 people the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented in the two programmes. ResultsAssuming 100% uptake and adherence to the screening protocol, in every 1000 persons, the NHS Health Check Programme would prevent 287 cases of a heart attack or stroke in individuals who would gain on average about 4 years of life without a heart attack or stroke, the precise gain depending on the extent of treatment for those with raised blood pressure, and 136 would be prescribed statins with no benefit. The corresponding figures for the Polypill Prevention Programme are 316 individuals who would, on average, gain 8 years of life without a heart attack or stroke with 260 prescribed the polypill with no benefit. Based on published estimates of uptake and adherence to of the NHS Health Check programme, only 24 cases per 1000 are currently benefitting instead of 287. This result could be achieved in the Polypill Prevention Programme with just 8% (24/316) of the eligible population taking part. ConclusionsThe Polypill Prevention Programme is by design simpler with the potential of preventing many more heart attacks and strokes; even an uptake of 40% would represent a 5-fold greater preventive effect than the NHS Health Check Programme.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a molecular sensitive ultrasound, offers a non-invasive diagnostic approach to image the deep-tissue biomarkers. Objectives The authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of MSOT to distinguish between healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with intermittent claudication (IC) by assessing hemoglobin-related biomarkers in calf muscle tissue. Methods In this monocentric, cross-sectional diagnostic trial using derivation (DC) and validation cohorts (VC) yll subjects underwent standardized PAD diagnostics. This included pulse palpation, ankle brachial index (ABI), duplex sonography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and assessment of health-related quality of life (VASCUQOL-6). The vascular occlusion profile in IC patients was confirmed by angiography (aggregated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, aTASC). MSOT imaging of calf muscle was performed before and after standardized heel raise provocation. Participants Of 123 screened individuals, 102 completed the study. MSOT-derived oxygenation (msO2) after the exercise differentiated IC and HV with an area under curve the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) in DC by 0.99 (95%CI 0.97;1.00, p&lt;0.001, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95.8%) and in the VC by 0.95 (95%CI 0.95;1.00, p&lt;0.001, sensitivity: 96.2%, specificity: 96.0%). mSO2 positively correlated with the ABI post-exercise (R=0.83, 95%CI 0.75;0.88, P&lt;0.001), the absolute walking distance in the 6MWT (R=0.77, 95%CI 0.68;0.84, P&lt;0.001), the VASCUQOL-6 (R=0.79, 95%CI 0.70;0.85, P&lt;0.001) and negatively with aTASC classification (R=-0.80, 95%CI -0.86;-0.72, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Post-exercise MSOT-derived saturation in the calf muscle was validated as a new and promising diagnostic biomarker to distinguish between HV and IC patients yielding high sensitivity and specificity.

        <p class="abstract">Increased left ventricular mass has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes including incident cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Such associations have been studied in relation to total left ventricular hypertrophy, while the regional distribution of myocardial hypertrophy is extremely variable and the clinical significant and genetic associations of such variability requires further study. Here, we use deep learning derived phenotypes of disproportionate patterns of hypertrophy, such as apical hypertrophy and septal hypertrophy, to study genome-wide and clinical associations in addition to and independent from total left ventricular mass within 35,268 UK Biobank participants. Adjusting for total left ventricular mass, apical hypertrophy is associated with elevated risk for cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, and the risk for cardiomyopathy was increased for subjects with increased apical or septal mass even in the absence of global hypertrophy. We identified seventeen genome-wide associations for left ventricular mass, three unique associations with increased apical mass, and three additional unique associations with increased septal mass. Further studies are needed in multi-ethnic cohorts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the NHS Health Check Programme with the Polypill Prevention Programme in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes.

DesignUse of published data and methodology to produce flow charts of the two programmes to determine screening performance and heart attacks and strokes prevented.

SettingThe UK population.

InterventionThe NHS Health Check Programme using a QRisk score on people aged 40-74 to select those eligible for a statin is compared with the Polypill Prevention programme in people aged 50 or more to select people for a combination of a statin and 3 low dose blood pressure lowering agents. In both programmes people had no history of heart attack or stroke.

Main outcome measuresIn 1000 people the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented in the two programmes.

ResultsAssuming 100% uptake and adherence to the screening protocol, in every 1000 persons, the NHS Health Check Programme would prevent 287 cases of a heart attack or stroke in individuals who would gain on average about 4 years of life without a heart attack or stroke, the precise gain depending on the extent of treatment for those with raised blood pressure, and 136 would be prescribed statins with no benefit. The corresponding figures for the Polypill Prevention Programme are 316 individuals who would, on average, gain 8 years of life without a heart attack or stroke with 260 prescribed the polypill with no benefit. Based on published estimates of uptake and adherence to of the NHS Health Check programme, only 24 cases per 1000 are currently benefitting instead of 287. This result could be achieved in the Polypill Prevention Programme with just 8% (24/316) of the eligible population taking part.

ConclusionsThe Polypill Prevention Programme is by design simpler with the potential of preventing many more heart attacks and strokes; even an uptake of 40% would represent a 5-fold greater preventive effect than the NHS Health Check Programme.</p>
