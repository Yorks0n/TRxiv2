This study aims to assess the potential impact of influenza vaccination on major cardiovascular events. Methods: A search of the medical English literature was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL up to 1 August 2023. Meta-analysis and stratified analyses were performed to investigate specific outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular death, and stroke. Pooled relative risks (RR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the associations. Results: A comprehensive analysis was conducted on a total of 9059 patients, with 4529 patients receiving the influenza vaccine and 4530 patients receiving a placebo. Among patients who received the influenza vaccine, a notable reduction in the occurrence of major cardiovascular events was observed, with 517 cases compared to 621 cases in the placebo group (RR, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.55-0.91). The stratified analysis revealed a decreased risk of MI in vaccinated patients (RR, 0.74; 95%CI, 0.56-0.97) and a significant reduction in cardiovascular death events (RR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.98). Conclusion: This study provides compelling evidence that influenza vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. These findings highlight the potential of influenza vaccination as an adjunctive strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention. Further research and exploration of underlying mechanisms are warranted to elucidate the observed beneficial effects.\nLeukocytes carrying Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) Mutations invade Human Atherosclerotic Plaques\nAuthors: von Scheidt, M.; Bauer, S.; Ma, A.; Hao, K.; Kessler, T.; Vilne, B.; Wang, Y.; Hodonsky, C.

M.; Schunkert, H.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.23292754\nBackgroundLeukocyte progenitors derived from clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined potential (CHIP) are associated with increased cardiovascular events. However, the prevalence and functional relevance of CHIP in coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear, and cells affected by CHIP have not been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques. MethodsCHIP mutations in blood and tissues were identified by targeted deep-DNA-sequencing (DNAseq: coverage \u003e3,000) and whole-genome-sequencing (WGS: coverage \u003e35). CHIP-mutated leukocytes were visualized in human atherosclerotic plaques by mutaFISHTM. Functional relevance of CHIP mutations was studied by RNAseq. ResultsDNAseq of whole blood from 540 deceased CAD patients of the Munich cardIovaScular StudIes biObaNk (MISSION) identified 253 (46.9%) CHIP mutation carriers (mean age 78.3 years). DNAseq on myocardium, atherosclerotic coronary and carotid arteries detected identical CHIP mutations in 18 out of 25 mutation carriers in tissue DNA. MutaFISHTM visualized individual macrophages carrying DNMT3A CHIP mutations in human atherosclerotic plaques. Studying monocyte-derived macrophages from Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task (STARNET; n=941) by WGS revealed CHIP mutations in 14.2% (mean age 67.1 years). RNAseq of these macrophages revealed that expression patterns in CHIP mutation carriers differed substantially from those of non-carriers. Moreover, patterns were different depending on the underlying mutations, e.g. those carrying TET2 mutations predominantly displayed upregulated inflammatory signaling whereas ASXL1 mutations showed stronger effects on metabolic pathways. ConclusionsDeep-DNA-sequencing reveals a high prevalence of CHIP mutations in whole blood of CAD patients. CHIP-affected leukocytes invade plaques in human coronary arteries. RNAseq data obtained from macrophages of CHIP-affected patients suggest that pro-atherosclerotic signaling differs depending on the underlying mutations. Further studies are necessary to understand whether specific pathways affected by CHIP mutations may be targeted for personalized treatment.\nPositive Airway Pressure Therapy Predicts Lower Mortality and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Incidence in Medicare Beneficiaries with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\nAuthors: Mazzotti, D. R.; Waitman, L. R.; Miller, J.; Sundar, K. M.; Stewart, N.; Gozal, D.; Song, X.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293156\nBackgroundObesity is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiovascular risk. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment for OSA, but evidence on its beneficial effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) prevention is limited. Using claims data, the effects of PAP on mortality and incidence of MACE among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA were examined. MethodsA cohort of beneficiaries (\u003e65 years) with [\u0026ge;]5 years of consecutive enrolment to Medicare and [\u0026ge;]2 distinct OSA claims was defined from multi-state, state-wide, multi-year (2011-2017) Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Evidence of PAP initiation and utilisation was based on PAP claims after OSA diagnosis. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or coronary revascularisation. Doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weights estimated treatment effects controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors. ResultsAmong 225,132 beneficiaries with OSA (median age 74 years; 45.3% women; median follow-up 3 years), those with evidence of PAP initiation (50.1%) had significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR [95%CI]: 0.57 [0.56-0.59]) and MACE incidence risk (0.90 [0.88-0.92]). Higher quartiles of annual PAP claims were progressively associated with lower mortality (Q2: 0.80 [0.75-0.86], Q3: 0.68 [0.64-0.72], Q4: 0.65 [0.61-0.70]) and MACE incidence risk (Q2: 0.91 [0.86-0.97], Q3: 0.87 [0.82-0.91], Q4: 0.85 [0.80-0.90]). ConclusionPAP utilisation was associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE incidence among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA. Results might inform trials assessing the importance of OSA therapy towards minimising cardiovascular risk and mortality in older adults.\n",

ResultsDNAseq of whole blood from 540 deceased CAD patients of the Munich cardIovaScular StudIes biObaNk (MISSION) identified 253 (46.9%) CHIP mutation carriers (mean age 78.3 years). DNAseq on myocardium, atherosclerotic coronary and carotid arteries detected identical CHIP mutations in 18 out of 25 mutation carriers in tissue DNA. MutaFISHTM visualized individual macrophages carrying DNMT3A CHIP mutations in human atherosclerotic plaques. Studying monocyte-derived macrophages from Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task (STARNET; n=941) by WGS revealed CHIP mutations in 14.2% (mean age 67.1 years). RNAseq of these macrophages revealed that expression patterns in CHIP mutation carriers differed substantially from those of non-carriers. Moreover, patterns were different depending on the underlying mutations, e.g. those carrying TET2 mutations predominantly displayed upregulated inflammatory signaling whereas ASXL1 mutations showed stronger effects on metabolic pathways.

ConclusionsDeep-DNA-sequencing reveals a high prevalence of CHIP mutations in whole blood of CAD patients. CHIP-affected leukocytes invade plaques in human coronary arteries. RNAseq data obtained from macrophages of CHIP-affected patients suggest that pro-atherosclerotic signaling differs depending on the underlying mutations. Further studies are necessary to understand whether specific pathways affected by CHIP mutations may be targeted for personalized treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObesity is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiovascular risk. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment for OSA, but evidence on its beneficial effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) prevention is limited. Using claims data, the effects of PAP on mortality and incidence of MACE among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA were examined.

MethodsA cohort of beneficiaries (&gt;65 years) with [&amp;ge;]5 years of consecutive enrolment to Medicare and [&amp;ge;]2 distinct OSA claims was defined from multi-state, state-wide, multi-year (2011-2017) Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Evidence of PAP initiation and utilisation was based on PAP claims after OSA diagnosis. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or coronary revascularisation. Doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weights estimated treatment effects controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors.

ResultsAmong 225,132 beneficiaries with OSA (median age 74 years; 45.3% women; median follow-up 3 years), those with evidence of PAP initiation (50.1%) had significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR [95%CI]: 0.57 [0.56-0.59]) and MACE incidence risk (0.90 [0.88-0.92]). Higher quartiles of annual PAP claims were progressively associated with lower mortality (Q2: 0.80 [0.75-0.86], Q3: 0.68 [0.64-0.72], Q4: 0.65 [0.61-0.70]) and MACE incidence risk (Q2: 0.91 [0.86-0.97], Q3: 0.87 [0.82-0.91], Q4: 0.85 [0.80-0.90]).

ConclusionPAP utilisation was associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE incidence among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA. Results might inform trials assessing the importance of OSA therapy towards minimising cardiovascular risk and mortality in older adults.</p>
