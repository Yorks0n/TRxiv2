Genetic disorders of type I interferon regulation are associated with a range of autoimmune and cerebrovascular phenotypes. Carriers of pathogenic variants involved in genetic disorders of type I interferons are generally considered asymptomatic. Preliminary data suggests, however, that genetically determined dysregulation of type I interferon responses is associated with autoimmunity, and may also be relevant to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and dementia.

Variants of interest will be included based on pre-defined clinical relevance and functional annotations (using LOFTEE, M-CAP and a minor allele frequency \u003c0.1%). The association of variants with 15 clinical and three neuroradiological phenotypes will be assessed with a rare variant genetic risk score and gene-level tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold from the number of genetic units and phenotypes tested. We will explore the association of significant genetic units with 196 additional health-related outcomes to help interpret their relevance and explore the clinical spectrum of genetic perturbations of type I interferon. Ethics and disseminationThe UKB has received ethical approval from the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment. This research will be conducted using the UKB Resource under application number 93,160. We expect to disseminate our results in a peer-reviewed journal and at an international cardiovascular conference. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThe UK Biobank is the largest whole-exome sequencing project to date, with marked power to detect associations from a limited number of rare, functional variants. C_LIO_LIOur study will leverage current knowledge of interferon biology and genotype-phenotype correlations in Mendelian diseases of type I interferon to test biologically plausible hypotheses. C_LIO_LIThe UK Biobank includes phenotypes from multiple sources, which improves classification accuracy for several health outcomes such as stroke and dementia. C_LIO_LIWe will carefully select genes and variants with strong evidence of biological relevance to optimize the power of our analyses, which is particularly relevant for less common phenotypes in the UK Biobank such as systemic lupus erythematosus. C_LIO_LIWe will increase the specificity of predicted loss-of-function variants by using stringent sample quality control and filtering criteria.

F.; Trebing, J.; Reich, C.; Haas, J.; Sedaghat-Hamedani, F.; Meder, B.; Dimmeler, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.16.22283442\nCardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.\nComparing the effectiveness of the NHS Health Check and the Polypill Prevention Programmes in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes.\nAuthors: Wald, N. J.; Hingorani, A. D.; Vale, S.; Bestwick, J. P.; Morris, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296215\nObjectiveTo compare the NHS Health Check Programme with the Polypill Prevention Programme in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. DesignUse of published data and methodology to produce flow charts of the two programmes to determine screening performance and heart attacks and strokes prevented. SettingThe UK population. InterventionThe NHS Health Check Programme using a QRisk score on people aged 40-74 to select those eligible for a statin is compared with the Polypill Prevention programme in people aged 50 or more to select people for a combination of a statin and 3 low dose blood pressure lowering agents. In both programmes people had no history of heart attack or stroke. Main outcome measuresIn 1000 people the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented in the two programmes. ResultsAssuming 100% uptake and adherence to the screening protocol, in every 1000 persons, the NHS Health Check Programme would prevent 287 cases of a heart attack or stroke in individuals who would gain on average about 4 years of life without a heart attack or stroke, the precise gain depending on the extent of treatment for those with raised blood pressure, and 136 would be prescribed statins with no benefit. The corresponding figures for the Polypill Prevention Programme are 316 individuals who would, on average, gain 8 years of life without a heart attack or stroke with 260 prescribed the polypill with no benefit. Based on published estimates of uptake and adherence to of the NHS Health Check programme, only 24 cases per 1000 are currently benefitting instead of 287. This result could be achieved in the Polypill Prevention Programme with just 8% (24/316) of the eligible population taking part. ConclusionsThe Polypill Prevention Programme is by design simpler with the potential of preventing many more heart attacks and strokes; even an uptake of 40% would represent a 5-fold greater preventive effect than the NHS Health Check Programme.\nPlatelet activation and platelet leukocyte aggregates are associated with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery\nAuthors: Brown, N.; Sullo, N.; Eagle-Hemminh, B.; Lai, F. Y.; Sheikh, S.; Tomkova, K.; Joel-David, L.; Aujla, H.; Kumar, T.; Goodall, A. H.; Murphy, G.; Wozniak, M. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296815\nWe hypothesised that circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) and micro-RNA levels can serve as predictive and diagnostic markers for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Plasma samples were collected from patients recruited to the MaRACAS study before, immediately after and 6-12, 24 and 48 hours after the procedure from 95 patients. Particle size distribution and concentrations were measured using NanoSight. EV derivation and platelet and leukocyte activation were measured using flow cytometry. Platelet function was measured with Multiplate, and circulating soluble biomarkers were measured with a MAGPIX device. Micro-RNA assessment was performed with TaqMan arrays in batched samples. Selected micro-RNAs were validated in each sample by qRT-PCR. Our data shows that platelet-derived EVs were higher 24 hours after surgery. TaqMan arrays identified miR-668 downregulated before and miR-92a-1, -920, -518a-3p, -133b and -1262 upregulated immediately after surgery in AKI patients. Validation confirmed that miR-1262 was significantly upregulated after surgery and identified miR-133b as downregulated before surgery. In addition, we showed that platelets were desensitised to ADP 6-12 hours after surgery. There were more platelet-granulocyte aggregates before and 24 hours after surgery, and levels of soluble ICAM1 were higher before surgery in patients with AKI. In conclusion, AKI is associated with platelet activation, suggesting that platelet inhibition treatments may be renoprotective. Furthermore, studies in larger cohorts should verify miR-1262 as a diagnostic marker of AKI.\nClinical and genetic associations of asymmetric apical and septal left ventricular hypertrophy\nAuthors: Yuan, V.; Vukadinovic, M.; Kwan, A. C.; Rader, F.; Li, D.; Ouyang, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296510\nIncreased left ventricular mass has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes including incident cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Such associations have been studied in relation to total left ventricular hypertrophy, while the regional distribution of myocardial hypertrophy is extremely variable and the clinical significant and genetic associations of such variability requires further study. Here, we use deep learning derived phenotypes of disproportionate patterns of hypertrophy, such as apical hypertrophy and septal hypertrophy, to study genome-wide and clinical associations in addition to and independent from total left ventricular mass within 35,268 UK Biobank participants. Adjusting for total left ventricular mass, apical hypertrophy is associated with elevated risk for cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, and the risk for cardiomyopathy was increased for subjects with increased apical or septal mass even in the absence of global hypertrophy. We identified seventeen genome-wide associations for left ventricular mass, three unique associations with increased apical mass, and three additional unique associations with increased septal mass. Further studies are needed in multi-ethnic cohorts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the NHS Health Check Programme with the Polypill Prevention Programme in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes.

DesignUse of published data and methodology to produce flow charts of the two programmes to determine screening performance and heart attacks and strokes prevented.

SettingThe UK population.

InterventionThe NHS Health Check Programme using a QRisk score on people aged 40-74 to select those eligible for a statin is compared with the Polypill Prevention programme in people aged 50 or more to select people for a combination of a statin and 3 low dose blood pressure lowering agents. In both programmes people had no history of heart attack or stroke.

Main outcome measuresIn 1000 people the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented in the two programmes.

ResultsAssuming 100% uptake and adherence to the screening protocol, in every 1000 persons, the NHS Health Check Programme would prevent 287 cases of a heart attack or stroke in individuals who would gain on average about 4 years of life without a heart attack or stroke, the precise gain depending on the extent of treatment for those with raised blood pressure, and 136 would be prescribed statins with no benefit. The corresponding figures for the Polypill Prevention Programme are 316 individuals who would, on average, gain 8 years of life without a heart attack or stroke with 260 prescribed the polypill with no benefit. Based on published estimates of uptake and adherence to of the NHS Health Check programme, only 24 cases per 1000 are currently benefitting instead of 287. This result could be achieved in the Polypill Prevention Programme with just 8% (24/316) of the eligible population taking part.

ConclusionsThe Polypill Prevention Programme is by design simpler with the potential of preventing many more heart attacks and strokes; even an uptake of 40% would represent a 5-fold greater preventive effect than the NHS Health Check Programme.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We hypothesised that circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) and micro-RNA levels can serve as predictive and diagnostic markers for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Plasma samples were collected from patients recruited to the MaRACAS study before, immediately after and 6-12, 24 and 48 hours after the procedure from 95 patients. Particle size distribution and concentrations were measured using NanoSight. EV derivation and platelet and leukocyte activation were measured using flow cytometry. Platelet function was measured with Multiplate, and circulating soluble biomarkers were measured with a MAGPIX device. Micro-RNA assessment was performed with TaqMan arrays in batched samples. Selected micro-RNAs were validated in each sample by qRT-PCR. Our data shows that platelet-derived EVs were higher 24 hours after surgery. TaqMan arrays identified miR-668 downregulated before and miR-92a-1, -920, -518a-3p, -133b and -1262 upregulated immediately after surgery in AKI patients. Validation confirmed that miR-1262 was significantly upregulated after surgery and identified miR-133b as downregulated before surgery. In addition, we showed that platelets were desensitised to ADP 6-12 hours after surgery. There were more platelet-granulocyte aggregates before and 24 hours after surgery, and levels of soluble ICAM1 were higher before surgery in patients with AKI. In conclusion, AKI is associated with platelet activation, suggesting that platelet inhibition treatments may be renoprotective. Furthermore, studies in larger cohorts should verify miR-1262 as a diagnostic marker of AKI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increased left ventricular mass has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes including incident cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Such associations have been studied in relation to total left ventricular hypertrophy, while the regional distribution of myocardial hypertrophy is extremely variable and the clinical significant and genetic associations of such variability requires further study. Here, we use deep learning derived phenotypes of disproportionate patterns of hypertrophy, such as apical hypertrophy and septal hypertrophy, to study genome-wide and clinical associations in addition to and independent from total left ventricular mass within 35,268 UK Biobank participants. Adjusting for total left ventricular mass, apical hypertrophy is associated with elevated risk for cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, and the risk for cardiomyopathy was increased for subjects with increased apical or septal mass even in the absence of global hypertrophy. We identified seventeen genome-wide associations for left ventricular mass, three unique associations with increased apical mass, and three additional unique associations with increased septal mass. Further studies are needed in multi-ethnic cohorts.</p>
