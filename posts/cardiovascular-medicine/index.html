L.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293846\nEpigenetic changes in gene expression due to DNA methylation are important physiologic and pathologic regulators of pulmonary vascular structure and function. Genetic or acquired alterations in DNA methylation or demethylation have been associated with the development and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the DNA methylome signature of human PAH and its consequences on the PAH transcriptome are unknown. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used for epigenome-wide mapping of DNA methylation in whole peripheral blood of 10 healthy people and 20 age/sex matched PAH patients. RNA deep sequencing was performed in parallel on the same samples. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify two PAH cohorts, one free of mutations in the genes know to be associated with PAH patients and the second had mutations of TET2, a newly identified PAH gene that encodes an enzyme that mediates DNA demethylation. We report an increased in global DNA methylation in the blood of PAH patients compared to healthy controls. Patients carrying the TET2 mutation had a further increase in DNA compared to mutation free PAH patients. We identified 1,069 unique Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) in the blood of PAH patients with a TET2 mutation. When organized into functional groups, we observed an enrichment of genes involved in immune, cell differentiation, or metabolic. When we compared these genes to publicly available data from an independent study on blood from PAH patients compared to controls, we identified 218 mRNA transcripts that align with our data (e.g. are hypermethylated blood genes that are downregulated in PAH blood), and functional analysis of these genes reveals common enriched terms in immune, cell differentiation, or metabolic function. We characterized DNA methylation changes associated with TET2 mutation in the blood of patients with PAH compared to controls. This data demonstrates that epigenetic regulation of genes by methylation is involved in altered immune function, cell differentiation and metabolism in PAH.\nEvolution of Myocarditis Incidence at a Large Healthcare System Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Case, B. C.; Waksman, O.; Rappaport, H.; Zhang, C.; Waksman, R.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.23294002\nBackgroundMyocarditis is a recognized complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Emerging studies further suggest an associated risk of myocarditis following administration of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccinations. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. We investigated the incidence of myocarditis throughout the COVID-19 pandemic across a large healthcare system in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. MethodsThis retrospective analysis of patients admitted from 2017-2022. Myocarditis cases were temporally divided into two cohorts based on year of admission (pre-pandemic 2017-2019; pandemic 2020-2022), which were compared for overall myocarditis incidence. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. ResultsThe cohort included 573 myocarditis patients (pre-pandemic=208, pandemic=365). From 2017-2019, the total number and rate of myocarditis cases was consistent. Overall cases of myocarditis increased during the pandemic (97, 126, 142 patients in 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively). Interestingly, the rate of myocarditis cases not related to COVID-19 or the vaccines stayed consistent (0.0674%, 0.0676%, 0.0807%), but the rate of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or the vaccines myocarditis increased each year (0.0210%, 0.0416%, 0.0480%). In-hospital mortality was similar between the two pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts (5.35% versus 7.7%, 0.276). ConclusionAmong hospitalized patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of myocarditis increased as compared to the pre-pandemic era. It appears this increase is associated with either the SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. In-hospital outcomes did not differ during the pandemic, but ongoing research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of myocarditis during the pandemic.\nCarriers of rare damaging CCR2 genetic variants are at lower risk of atherosclerotic disease\nAuthors: Georgakis, M.

W.; Yanek, L. R.; Kral, B. G.; Becker, L. C.; Peyser, P. A.; Bielak, L. F.; Ammous, F.; Carson, A. P.; Hall, M. E.; Raffield, L. M.; Rich, S.; Post, W.; Tracy, R.; Taylor, K.; Guo, X.; Mahaney, Score: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294063\nBackgroundThe CCL2/CCR2 axis governs monocyte trafficking and recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions. Human genetic analyses and population-based studies support an association between circulating CCL2 levels and atherosclerosis. Still, it remains unknown whether pharmacological targeting of CCR2, the main CCL2 receptor, would provide protection against human atherosclerotic disease. MethodsIn whole-exome sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants (40-69 years), we identified predicted loss-of-function (LoF) or damaging missense (REVEL score \u003e0.5) variants within the CCR2 gene. We prioritized variants associated with lower monocyte count (p\u003c0.05) and tested associations with vascular risk factors and risk of atherosclerotic disease over a mean follow-up of 14 years. The results were replicated in a pooled cohort of three independent datasets (TOPMed, deCODE and Penn Medicine BioBank; total n=441,445) and the effect of the most frequent damaging variant was experimentally validated. ResultsA total of 45 predicted LoF or damaging missense variants were identified in the CCR2 gene, 4 of which were also significantly associated with lower monocyte count, but not with other white blood cell counts. Heterozygous carriers of these variants were at a lower risk of a combined atherosclerosis outcome, showed a lower burden of atherosclerosis across four vascular beds, and were at a lower lifetime risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of association with vascular risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, glycemic status, or C-reactive protein. Using a cAMP assay, we found that cells transfected with the most frequent CCR2 damaging variant (3:46358273:T:A, M249K, 547 carriers, frequency: 0.14%) show a decrease in signaling in response to CCL2. The associations of the M249K variant with myocardial infarction were consistent across cohorts (ORUKB: 0.62 95%CI: 0.39-0.96; ORexternal: 0.64 95%CI: 0.34-1.19; ORpooled: 0.64 95%CI: 0.45-0.90). In a phenome-wide association study, we found no evidence for higher risk of common infections or mortality among carriers of damaging CCR2 variants. ConclusionsHeterozygous carriers of damaging CCR2 variants have a lower burden of atherosclerosis and lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction. In conjunction with previous evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies, our findings highlight the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.\n",

Myocarditis cases were temporally divided into two cohorts based on year of admission (pre-pandemic 2017-2019; pandemic 2020-2022), which were compared for overall myocarditis incidence. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.

ResultsThe cohort included 573 myocarditis patients (pre-pandemic=208, pandemic=365). From 2017-2019, the total number and rate of myocarditis cases was consistent. Overall cases of myocarditis increased during the pandemic (97, 126, 142 patients in 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively). Interestingly, the rate of myocarditis cases not related to COVID-19 or the vaccines stayed consistent (0.0674%, 0.0676%, 0.0807%), but the rate of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or the vaccines myocarditis increased each year (0.0210%, 0.0416%, 0.0480%). In-hospital mortality was similar between the two pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts (5.35% versus 7.7%, 0.276).

ConclusionAmong hospitalized patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of myocarditis increased as compared to the pre-pandemic era. It appears this increase is associated with either the SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. In-hospital outcomes did not differ during the pandemic, but ongoing research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of myocarditis during the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CCL2/CCR2 axis governs monocyte trafficking and recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions. Human genetic analyses and population-based studies support an association between circulating CCL2 levels and atherosclerosis. Still, it remains unknown whether pharmacological targeting of CCR2, the main CCL2 receptor, would provide protection against human atherosclerotic disease.

MethodsIn whole-exome sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants (40-69 years), we identified predicted loss-of-function (LoF) or damaging missense (REVEL score &gt;0.5) variants within the CCR2 gene. We prioritized variants associated with lower monocyte count (p&lt;0.05) and tested associations with vascular risk factors and risk of atherosclerotic disease over a mean follow-up of 14 years. The results were replicated in a pooled cohort of three independent datasets (TOPMed, deCODE and Penn Medicine BioBank; total n=441,445) and the effect of the most frequent damaging variant was experimentally validated.

ResultsA total of 45 predicted LoF or damaging missense variants were identified in the CCR2 gene, 4 of which were also significantly associated with lower monocyte count, but not with other white blood cell counts. Heterozygous carriers of these variants were at a lower risk of a combined atherosclerosis outcome, showed a lower burden of atherosclerosis across four vascular beds, and were at a lower lifetime risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of association with vascular risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, glycemic status, or C-reactive protein. Using a cAMP assay, we found that cells transfected with the most frequent CCR2 damaging variant (3:46358273:T:A, M249K, 547 carriers, frequency: 0.14%) show a decrease in signaling in response to CCL2. The associations of the M249K variant with myocardial infarction were consistent across cohorts (ORUKB: 0.62 95%CI: 0.39-0.96; ORexternal: 0.64 95%CI: 0.34-1.19; ORpooled: 0.64 95%CI: 0.45-0.90). In a phenome-wide association study, we found no evidence for higher risk of common infections or mortality among carriers of damaging CCR2 variants.

ConclusionsHeterozygous carriers of damaging CCR2 variants have a lower burden of atherosclerosis and lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction. In conjunction with previous evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies, our findings highlight the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.</p>
