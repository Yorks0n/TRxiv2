Interrogating distinct and overlapping mechanisms may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Objective In this study, we aimed to: identify and compare (1) epidemiologic and (2) causal, genetic relationships between metabolites and CAD, PAD, and VTE. Methods We used metabolomic data from 95,402 individuals in the UK Biobank, excluding individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, first five principal components of ancestry, and statin use estimated the epidemiologic associations of 249 metabolites with incident CAD, PAD, or VTE. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) estimated the causal effects between metabolites and cardiovascular phenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics for metabolites (N = 118,466 from UK Biobank), CAD (N = 184,305 from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 2015), PAD (N = 243,060 from Million Veterans Project) and VTE (N = 650,119 from Million Veterans Project). Multivariable MR (MVMR) was further performed in subsequent analyses. Results We found that 194, 111, and 69 metabolites were epidemiologically associated (P \u003c 0.001) with CAD, PAD, and VTE, respectively. Metabolomic profiles exhibited variable similarity between disease pairs: CAD and PAD (N = 100, R2 = 0.499), CAD and VTE (N = 68, R2 = 0.455), and PAD and VTE (N = 54 shared associations, R2 = 0.752). MR revealed 28 metabolites that increased risk for both CAD and PAD and 2 metabolites that increased risk for CAD but decreased risk for VTE. Despite strong epidemiologic overlap, no metabolites had a shared genetic relationship between PAD and VTE. MVMR revealed several metabolites with shared causal effects on CAD and PAD related to cholesterol content within very-low-density lipoprotein particles. Conclusions While common arterial and venous conditions are associated with overlapping metabolomic profiles, MR prioritized the role of remnant cholesterol in arterial diseases but not venous thrombosis.\nSex-Specific Clinical and Genetic Factors Associated with Adverse Outcomes in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: Butters, A.; Arnott, C.; Sweeting, J.; Claggett, B.; Cuomo, A.; Abrams, D.; Ashley, E. A.; Day, S.; Helms, A. S.; Lampert, R.; Lin, K.; Michels, M.; Miller, E.; Olivotto, I.; Owens, A.; Parikh, V. N.; Pereira, A.; Rossano, J.; Ryan, T.; Saberi, S.; Stendahl, J.; Ware, J. S.; Atherton, J.; Semsarian, C.; Lakdawala, N.; Ho, C.; Ingles, J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.23291422\nBackgroundWomen with HCM present at a more advanced stage of the disease and have a higher risk of heart failure and death. The factors contributing to these differences are unclear. We aimed to investigate sex differences in clinical and genetic factors associated with adverse outcomes in the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe). MethodsCox proportional hazard models were fit with a sex interaction term to determine if significant sex differences existed in the association between risk factors and outcomes. Models were fit separately for women and men to find the sex-specific hazard ratio. ResultsAfter a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, women had a higher risk of heart failure (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.88, p=0.0003) but a lower risk of atrial fibrillation (0.74; 0.59-0.93; p\u003c0.0001) and ventricular arrhythmia (0.60; 0.38-0.94; p=0.027) than men. No sex difference was observed for death (p=0.84). Sarcomere-positive men had a higher risk of heart failure and death, not seen in women (p-heterogeneity=0.006 \u0026 p-heterogeneity=0.035, respectively). MYBPC3 variants were associated with lower heart failure risk in women than other HCM subgroups, with no significant change for men (p-heterogeneity \u003c0.0001). Women with moderate risk of ventricular arrhythmia (4% to \u003c6% ESC risk score) were at a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia than those scoring \u003c4%, not observed in men (p-heterogeneity= 0.019). ConclusionClinical and genetic factors contributing to adverse outcomes in HCM affect women and men differently. Research to inform sex-specific management of HCM could improve outcomes for both sexes.\nIdentification of two new genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation in the Taiwanese population- implication of metabolism and fibrosis in atrial fibrillation mechanism\nAuthors: Lee, G.-W.; Chen, J.-J.; Chang, S.-N.; Chiu, F.-C.; Huang, P.-S.; Chuang, E. Y.; Tsai, C.-T.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291466\nBackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in more than 100 genomic regions associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Genes for AF identified by GWAS in the Caucasian populations may show ethnic differences in the Asian populations. We sought to identify other novel AF genes in the Taiwanese population by multi-stage GWAS. MethodsIn exploratory stage, GWAS with whole genome genotypes (4,512,191 SNPs) were done in 516 young AF Patients (58.1{+/-}8.7 years-old, 438 men [84.9%]) from the National Taiwan University AF registry (NTUAFR) and 5160 normal sinus rhythm controls (57.8 {+/-}8.7 years-old, 2460 men [47.7%]) from Taiwan Biobank. Significant loci were replicated in 1002 independent AF patients and 2003 NSR controls, and also in UK biobank (5630 AF cases and 24000 NSR controls). Quantitative trait locus mapping was performed to implicate functional significance. ResultsStage I GWAS revealed 3 loci associated with AF with the genome-wide significance level, which included locus close to previously reported PITX2 gene (chromosome 4q25, rs2723329, P=1.53x10-10) and two novel loci close to RAP1A and HNF4G genes (chromosome 1p13.2, rs7525578, P= 1.24x10-26; chromosome 8q21.13, rs2980218, P=2.19x10-9, respectively). They were further validated in a stage II replication population (P=4.60x10-9, 4.45x10-10 and 6.97x10-5 for RAP1A, PITX2 and HNF4G, respectively). These 3 genes were also validated in the UK population. These 3 significant SNPs also show significant association with tissue expressions (RAP1A expression in thyroid, PITX2 in testicular, and HNF4G in lymphocyte tissues, respectively). ConclusionsGWAS in Taiwan revealed previously reported PITX2 and two novel AF genes (RAP1A and HNF4G) with the most significant locus in RAP1A. RAP1A and HNF4G genes may implicate fibrosis and metabolic pathways, respectively, in the mechanism of AF.\nTrends and landscape of cardiovascular disease studies characteristics on ClinicalTrials.gov from 2012 to 2021\nAuthors: Rawlley, B.; Bansal, K.; Dayal, U.; Julka, D.; Salooja, I.; Cordova Sanchez, A.; Gupta, K.; Kumar, S.; Chaudhuri, D.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291308\nIntroductionTo analyze cardiovascular disease (CVD) studies from the United States registered on ClinicalTrials.gov focusing on characteristics associated with their external validity; the presence of Data Monitoring Committee/Data Safety Monitoring Board (DMC/DSMB), randomization, blinding, and gender of the principal investigators (PIs). MethodsWe queried the Application Programming Interface (API) of ClinicalTrials.gov to extract data on characteristics of the identified studies, most notably, DMC/DSMB status, Design Allocation, Design masking, and gender of PIs. ResultsWe identified 536 studies pertinent to CVD for this analysis. Out of 536, 471 (88%) were interventional studies (Clinical trials) and 65 (12%) were observational studies with interventions. Amongst these, 261 (49%) reported having a DMC, 312 (66%) reported randomization, 224 (48%) reported masking and 122 (19%) of the PIs were women. No trend was seen in the annual proportion of studies with DMC, randomization, masking, and women as PIs (P-trend \u003e 0.05 for all). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were notable for higher odds of DMC (aOR, 5.28; 95% CI, 2.70 - 10.90; P \u003c 0.05) and blinding (aOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.29 - 4.64; P \u003c 0.05) in NIH-funded studies and higher odds of being terminated/suspended or withdrawn in basic science studies (aOR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.07 - 6.90; P \u003c 0.05). No relation was seen between any characteristics and the study being completed. ConclusionsWe report on the absence of DMCs, randomization, blinding, women as PIs, and lack of cross-gender collaboration in the leadership of CVD studies without any favorable trend over the past decade. This calls for comprehensive efforts to improve these trends and ultimately, the external validity of studies. We also call for an overhaul of the definition of the phase of a clinical trial that centers around a drug being the intervention.\nCombined near infrared photoacoustic imaging and ultrasound detects vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque\nAuthors: Schneider, M.; Wang, J.; Kare, A.; Adkar, S.; Salmi, D.; Bell, C.; Alsaigh, T.; Wagh, D.; Coller, J.; Mayer, A.; Snyder, S.; Borowsky, A. D.; Long, S. R.; Lansberg, M. G.; Steinberg, G. K.; Heit, J. J.; Leeper, N.; Ferrara, K. W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.11.23291099\nAtherosclerosis is an inflammatory process resulting in the deposition of cholesterol and cellular debris, narrowing of the vessel lumen and clot formation. Characterization of the morphology and vulnerability of the lesion is essential for effective clinical management. Photoacoustic imaging has sufficient penetration and sensitivity to map and characterize human atherosclerotic plaque. Here, near infrared photoacoustic imaging is shown to detect plaque components and, when combined with ultrasound imaging, to differentiate stable and vulnerable plaque. In an ex vivo study of photoacoustic imaging of excised plaque from 25 patients, 88.2% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity were achieved using a clinically-relevant protocol. In order to determine the origin of the near-infrared auto-photoacoustic (NIRAPA) signal, immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics were applied to adjacent sections of the plaque. The highest NIRAPA signal was spatially correlated with bilirubin and associated blood-based residue and inflammatory macrophages bearing CD74, HLA-DR, CD14 and CD163 markers. In summary, we establish the potential to apply the NIRAPA-ultrasound imaging combination to detect vulnerable carotid plaque.

C.; Lluri, G.; Lin, J.; Moore, J. P.; Van Arsdell, G.; Biniwale, R.; Si, M.-S.; Naini, B.; Venick, R.; Saab, S.; Wray, C.; Ponder, R.; Rosenthal, C.; Klomhaus, A.; Bostrom, K. I.; Aboulhosn, J. A.; Kaldas, F.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290997\nBackgroundThe molecular mechanisms underlying Fontan associated liver disease (FALD) remain largely unknown. We aimed to assess intrahepatic transcriptomic differences among patients with FALD according to the degree of liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included adults with the Fontan circulation at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data prior to the liver biopsy were extracted from medical records. Patients were classified into early (F1-F2) or advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples; RNA libraries were constructed using rRNA depletion method and sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and Metascape. Medical records were comprehensively reviewed for a composite clinical outcome which included decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, protein-losing enteropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or death. ResultsPatients with advanced fibrosis had higher serum BNP levels and Fontan, mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures. The composite clinical outcome was present in 23 patients (22%) and was predicted by age at Fontan, right ventricular morphology and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals on multivariable analysis. Samples with advanced fibrosis had 228 up-regulated genes compared to early fibrosis. Samples with the composite clinical outcome had 894 up-regulated genes compared to those without it. A total of 136 up-regulated genes were identified in both comparisons and these genes were enriched in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to oxidative stress, VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and vasculature development. ConclusionsPatients with FALD and advanced liver fibrosis or the composite clinical outcome exhibit up-regulated genes including pathways related to inflammation, congestion, and angiogenesis. This adds further insight into FALD pathophysiology.\nStacking multiple prediction models to optimise performance in local settings: exemplars in cardiometabolic disease\nAuthors: Ghosh, S.; Gratton, J.; Vermeulen, R. C. H.; Asselbergs, F. W.; Vlaanderen, J. J.; Schmidt, A. F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.23291489\nBackgroundRisk prediction models are used in healthcare settings to tailor therapies to individuals most likely to benefit. Despite appropriate external validation, difference in local characteristics (e.g. patient mix) may attenuate model performance. Prior to any implementation it is therefore advisable to explore local performance, typically requiring a modest amount of historic data. Depending on model performance, model adjustments might be necessary which often require large amounts of data. Here we explore a small sample size approach approximating de novo derivation, by combining model stacking and transfer learning, referred to as stacked transfer learning. As an example we focus on stacking previously trained risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, (chronic) kidney disease, and diabetes. MethodsWe leverage data from the UK biobank to illustrate the benefits of stacking previously trained risk prediction models, predicting the risk of incident CVD, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes. To mimic sample sizes available in local settings, such as a small to large healthcare trust, we iterated the number of training cases between 10 and 1000. Model stacking was performed using a LASSO penalized logistic regression model, and compared performance of a de novo model estimating the local association of 33 variables used in the aforementioned risk prediction models. ResultsWe found that stacked models require roughly one-tenths of the training sample size compared to de novo derivation of a prediction model. For example, predicting CVD the stacked model required 30 cases to reach a area under the curve (AUC) value (with 95% CI) of 0.732 (0.728, 0.735), while the de novo model required 300 cases to reach approximately the same performance. As expected, the absolute performance depended on the predicted outcome, where for example the difference between de novo and stacked modelling was smaller for CKD prediction. ConclusionWe show that our proposed \"stacked transfer learning\" approach closely approximated the predictive performance of a de novo model, often requiring only a fraction of the data. As such, this approach should be considered when tailoring a model to a local setting.\nMultivariable models of postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery patients: proteomic and demographic contributions\nAuthors: Goncalves, M. C. B.; Khera, T.; Otu, H. H.; Narayanan, S.; Dillon, S. T.; Shanker, A.; Gu, X.; Jung, Y.; Ngo, L. H.; Marcantonio, E. R.; Libermann, T. A.; Subramaniam, B.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.23289741\nBackground: Delirium following cardiac surgery is common, morbid, and costly, but may be prevented with risk stratification and targeted intervention. Preoperative protein signatures may identify patients at increased risk for worse postoperative outcomes, including delirium. In this study, we aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers and develop a predictive model for postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, while also uncovering possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: SOMAscan analysis of 1,305 proteins in the plasma from 57 older adults undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted to define delirium-specific protein signatures at baseline (PREOP) and postoperative day 2 (POD2). Selected proteins were validated in 115 patients using the ELLA multiplex immunoassay platform. Proteins were combined with clinical and demographic variables to build multivariable models that estimate the risk of postoperative delirium and bring light to the underlying pathophysiology. Results: A total of 666 proteins from SOMAscan analysis were found altered between PREOP and POD2 (Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-p\u003c0.01). Using these results and findings from other studies, 12 biomarker candidates (Tukeys fold change (|tFC|)\u003e1.4) were selected for ELLA multiplex validation. Eight proteins were significantly altered at PREOP, and seven proteins at POD2 (p\u003c0.05), in patients who developed postoperative delirium compared to non-delirious patients. Statistical analyses of model fit resulted in selecting a combination of age, sex, and different 3-protein biomarker panels highly correlated with delirium at PREOP (angiopoietin-2, ANGPT2; C-C motif chemokine 5, CCL5; and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, TIMP1; AUC=0.829) and POD2 (lipocalin-2, LCN2; neurofilament light chain, NFL; and CCL5; AUC=0.845). The delirium-associated proteins identified as biomarker candidates are involved with inflammation, glial dysfunction, vascularization, and hemostasis, highlighting the multifactorial pathophysiology of delirium. Conclusion: Our study proposes two models of postoperative delirium that include a combination of older age, female sex, and altered levels of proteins both preoperatively and postoperatively. Our results support the identification of patients at higher risk of developing postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and provide insights on the underlying pathophysiology. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02546765). CLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIComprehensive proteomics screening of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and its association with the development of postoperative delirium. C_LIO_LIWe propose two different multivariable models: the first model inputs information on risk factors for developing postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, which could be used clinically to preoperatively predict those patients at higher risk; and the second model informs on postoperative proteomic signatures that bring light to delirium pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms for further investigation.

S.; SANNINO, A.; Smith, R.; Szerlip, M.; Vemulapalli, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291628\nBackgroundTranscatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve (MV) repair (TEER) is an effective treatment for patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR) at prohibitive risk for surgical MV repair (MVr). High volume MVr centers and high volume TEER centers have better outcomes than low volume centers, respectively. However little is known about whether MVr volume, and specifically complex MVr volume, predicts TEER outcomes. We hypothesized that high volume MV surgical centers would have superior risk-adjusted outcomes for TEER than tlow volume centers. MethodsWe combined data from the ACC/STS TVT registry and the STS adult cardiac surgery database. Complex MVr, defined as leaflet resection or artificial chords with or without annuloplasty was evaluated as a continuous variable and as pre-defined categories (\u003c25, 25-49 and [\u0026ge;] 50 MV repairs/year). A generalized linear mixed model was used to evaluate risk-adjusted in-hospital/30-day mortality, 30 day HF readmission and TEER success (MR [\u0026le;] 2+ and gradient \u003c 5 mmHg). ResultsThe study comprised 41,834 patients from 500 sites. TEER mortality at 30-days was 3.5% with no significant difference across MVr volume on unadjusted (p=0.141) or adjusted (p=0.071) analysis of volume as a continuous variable. One-year mortality was 15.0% and was lower for higher MVr volume centers when adjusted for clinical and demographic variables (p=0.027). HF readmission at one year was 9.4% and was statistically significantly lower in high volume centers on both unadjusted (p=0.017) or adjusted (p-0.015) analysis. TEER success was 54.6% and was not statistically significantly different across MV surgical site volumes (p=0.4271). ConclusionsTEER can be safely performed in centers with low volumes of complex MV repair. However, one-year mortality and HF readmission are superior at centers with higher MVr volume.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Rationale Venous and arterial cardiovascular conditions, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), are genetically correlated. Interrogating distinct and overlapping mechanisms may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Objective In this study, we aimed to: identify and compare (1) epidemiologic and (2) causal, genetic relationships between metabolites and CAD, PAD, and VTE. Methods We used metabolomic data from 95,402 individuals in the UK Biobank, excluding individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, first five principal components of ancestry, and statin use estimated the epidemiologic associations of 249 metabolites with incident CAD, PAD, or VTE. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) estimated the causal effects between metabolites and cardiovascular phenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics for metabolites (N = 118,466 from UK Biobank), CAD (N = 184,305 from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 2015), PAD (N = 243,060 from Million Veterans Project) and VTE (N = 650,119 from Million Veterans Project). Multivariable MR (MVMR) was further performed in subsequent analyses. Results We found that 194, 111, and 69 metabolites were epidemiologically associated (P &lt; 0.001) with CAD, PAD, and VTE, respectively. Metabolomic profiles exhibited variable similarity between disease pairs: CAD and PAD (N = 100, R2 = 0.499), CAD and VTE (N = 68, R2 = 0.455), and PAD and VTE (N = 54 shared associations, R2 = 0.752). MR revealed 28 metabolites that increased risk for both CAD and PAD and 2 metabolites that increased risk for CAD but decreased risk for VTE. Despite strong epidemiologic overlap, no metabolites had a shared genetic relationship between PAD and VTE. MVMR revealed several metabolites with shared causal effects on CAD and PAD related to cholesterol content within very-low-density lipoprotein particles. Conclusions While common arterial and venous conditions are associated with overlapping metabolomic profiles, MR prioritized the role of remnant cholesterol in arterial diseases but not venous thrombosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWomen with HCM present at a more advanced stage of the disease and have a higher risk of heart failure and death. The factors contributing to these differences are unclear. We aimed to investigate sex differences in clinical and genetic factors associated with adverse outcomes in the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe).

MethodsCox proportional hazard models were fit with a sex interaction term to determine if significant sex differences existed in the association between risk factors and outcomes. Models were fit separately for women and men to find the sex-specific hazard ratio.

ResultsAfter a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, women had a higher risk of heart failure (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.88, p=0.0003) but a lower risk of atrial fibrillation (0.74; 0.59-0.93; p&lt;0.0001) and ventricular arrhythmia (0.60; 0.38-0.94; p=0.027) than men. No sex difference was observed for death (p=0.84). Sarcomere-positive men had a higher risk of heart failure and death, not seen in women (p-heterogeneity=0.006 &amp; p-heterogeneity=0.035, respectively). MYBPC3 variants were associated with lower heart failure risk in women than other HCM subgroups, with no significant change for men (p-heterogeneity &lt;0.0001). Women with moderate risk of ventricular arrhythmia (4% to &lt;6% ESC risk score) were at a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia than those scoring &lt;4%, not observed in men (p-heterogeneity= 0.019).

ConclusionClinical and genetic factors contributing to adverse outcomes in HCM affect women and men differently. Research to inform sex-specific management of HCM could improve outcomes for both sexes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in more than 100 genomic regions associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Genes for AF identified by GWAS in the Caucasian populations may show ethnic differences in the Asian populations. We sought to identify other novel AF genes in the Taiwanese population by multi-stage GWAS.

MethodsIn exploratory stage, GWAS with whole genome genotypes (4,512,191 SNPs) were done in 516 young AF Patients (58.1{&#43;/-}8.7 years-old, 438 men [84.9%]) from the National Taiwan University AF registry (NTUAFR) and 5160 normal sinus rhythm controls (57.8 {&#43;/-}8.7 years-old, 2460 men [47.7%]) from Taiwan Biobank. Significant loci were replicated in 1002 independent AF patients and 2003 NSR controls, and also in UK biobank (5630 AF cases and 24000 NSR controls). Quantitative trait locus mapping was performed to implicate functional significance.

ResultsStage I GWAS revealed 3 loci associated with AF with the genome-wide significance level, which included locus close to previously reported PITX2 gene (chromosome 4q25, rs2723329, P=1.53x10-10) and two novel loci close to RAP1A and HNF4G genes (chromosome 1p13.2, rs7525578, P= 1.24x10-26; chromosome 8q21.13, rs2980218, P=2.19x10-9, respectively). They were further validated in a stage II replication population (P=4.60x10-9, 4.45x10-10 and 6.97x10-5 for RAP1A, PITX2 and HNF4G, respectively). These 3 genes were also validated in the UK population. These 3 significant SNPs also show significant association with tissue expressions (RAP1A expression in thyroid, PITX2 in testicular, and HNF4G in lymphocyte tissues, respectively).

ConclusionsGWAS in Taiwan revealed previously reported PITX2 and two novel AF genes (RAP1A and HNF4G) with the most significant locus in RAP1A. RAP1A and HNF4G genes may implicate fibrosis and metabolic pathways, respectively, in the mechanism of AF.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionTo analyze cardiovascular disease (CVD) studies from the United States registered on ClinicalTrials.gov focusing on characteristics associated with their external validity; the presence of Data Monitoring Committee/Data Safety Monitoring Board (DMC/DSMB), randomization, blinding, and gender of the principal investigators (PIs).

MethodsWe queried the Application Programming Interface (API) of ClinicalTrials.gov to extract data on characteristics of the identified studies, most notably, DMC/DSMB status, Design Allocation, Design masking, and gender of PIs.

ResultsWe identified 536 studies pertinent to CVD for this analysis. Out of 536, 471 (88%) were interventional studies (Clinical trials) and 65 (12%) were observational studies with interventions. Amongst these, 261 (49%) reported having a DMC, 312 (66%) reported randomization, 224 (48%) reported masking and 122 (19%) of the PIs were women. No trend was seen in the annual proportion of studies with DMC, randomization, masking, and women as PIs (P-trend &gt; 0.05 for all). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were notable for higher odds of DMC (aOR, 5.28; 95% CI, 2.70 - 10.90; P &lt; 0.05) and blinding (aOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.29 - 4.64; P &lt; 0.05) in NIH-funded studies and higher odds of being terminated/suspended or withdrawn in basic science studies (aOR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.07 - 6.90; P &lt; 0.05). No relation was seen between any characteristics and the study being completed.

ConclusionsWe report on the absence of DMCs, randomization, blinding, women as PIs, and lack of cross-gender collaboration in the leadership of CVD studies without any favorable trend over the past decade. This calls for comprehensive efforts to improve these trends and ultimately, the external validity of studies. We also call for an overhaul of the definition of the phase of a clinical trial that centers around a drug being the intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process resulting in the deposition of cholesterol and cellular debris, narrowing of the vessel lumen and clot formation. Characterization of the morphology and vulnerability of the lesion is essential for effective clinical management. Photoacoustic imaging has sufficient penetration and sensitivity to map and characterize human atherosclerotic plaque. Here, near infrared photoacoustic imaging is shown to detect plaque components and, when combined with ultrasound imaging, to differentiate stable and vulnerable plaque. In an ex vivo study of photoacoustic imaging of excised plaque from 25 patients, 88.2% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity were achieved using a clinically-relevant protocol. In order to determine the origin of the near-infrared auto-photoacoustic (NIRAPA) signal, immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics were applied to adjacent sections of the plaque. The highest NIRAPA signal was spatially correlated with bilirubin and associated blood-based residue and inflammatory macrophages bearing CD74, HLA-DR, CD14 and CD163 markers. In summary, we establish the potential to apply the NIRAPA-ultrasound imaging combination to detect vulnerable carotid plaque.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe molecular mechanisms underlying Fontan associated liver disease (FALD) remain largely unknown. We aimed to assess intrahepatic transcriptomic differences among patients with FALD according to the degree of liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included adults with the Fontan circulation at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data prior to the liver biopsy were extracted from medical records. Patients were classified into early (F1-F2) or advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples; RNA libraries were constructed using rRNA depletion method and sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and Metascape. Medical records were comprehensively reviewed for a composite clinical outcome which included decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, protein-losing enteropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or death.

ResultsPatients with advanced fibrosis had higher serum BNP levels and Fontan, mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures. The composite clinical outcome was present in 23 patients (22%) and was predicted by age at Fontan, right ventricular morphology and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals on multivariable analysis. Samples with advanced fibrosis had 228 up-regulated genes compared to early fibrosis. Samples with the composite clinical outcome had 894 up-regulated genes compared to those without it. A total of 136 up-regulated genes were identified in both comparisons and these genes were enriched in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to oxidative stress, VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and vasculature development.

ConclusionsPatients with FALD and advanced liver fibrosis or the composite clinical outcome exhibit up-regulated genes including pathways related to inflammation, congestion, and angiogenesis. This adds further insight into FALD pathophysiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRisk prediction models are used in healthcare settings to tailor therapies to individuals most likely to benefit. Despite appropriate external validation, difference in local characteristics (e.g. patient mix) may attenuate model performance. Prior to any implementation it is therefore advisable to explore local performance, typically requiring a modest amount of historic data. Depending on model performance, model adjustments might be necessary which often require large amounts of data. Here we explore a small sample size approach approximating de novo derivation, by combining model stacking and transfer learning, referred to as stacked transfer learning. As an example we focus on stacking previously trained risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, (chronic) kidney disease, and diabetes.

MethodsWe leverage data from the UK biobank to illustrate the benefits of stacking previously trained risk prediction models, predicting the risk of incident CVD, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes. To mimic sample sizes available in local settings, such as a small to large healthcare trust, we iterated the number of training cases between 10 and 1000. Model stacking was performed using a LASSO penalized logistic regression model, and compared performance of a de novo model estimating the local association of 33 variables used in the aforementioned risk prediction models.

ResultsWe found that stacked models require roughly one-tenths of the training sample size compared to de novo derivation of a prediction model. For example, predicting CVD the stacked model required 30 cases to reach a area under the curve (AUC) value (with 95% CI) of 0.732 (0.728, 0.735), while the de novo model required 300 cases to reach approximately the same performance. As expected, the absolute performance depended on the predicted outcome, where for example the difference between de novo and stacked modelling was smaller for CKD prediction.

ConclusionWe show that our proposed &#34;stacked transfer learning&#34; approach closely approximated the predictive performance of a de novo model, often requiring only a fraction of the data. As such, this approach should be considered when tailoring a model to a local setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Delirium following cardiac surgery is common, morbid, and costly, but may be prevented with risk stratification and targeted intervention. Preoperative protein signatures may identify patients at increased risk for worse postoperative outcomes, including delirium. In this study, we aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers and develop a predictive model for postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, while also uncovering possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: SOMAscan analysis of 1,305 proteins in the plasma from 57 older adults undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted to define delirium-specific protein signatures at baseline (PREOP) and postoperative day 2 (POD2). Selected proteins were validated in 115 patients using the ELLA multiplex immunoassay platform. Proteins were combined with clinical and demographic variables to build multivariable models that estimate the risk of postoperative delirium and bring light to the underlying pathophysiology. Results: A total of 666 proteins from SOMAscan analysis were found altered between PREOP and POD2 (Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-p&lt;0.01). Using these results and findings from other studies, 12 biomarker candidates (Tukeys fold change (|tFC|)&gt;1.4) were selected for ELLA multiplex validation. Eight proteins were significantly altered at PREOP, and seven proteins at POD2 (p&lt;0.05), in patients who developed postoperative delirium compared to non-delirious patients. Statistical analyses of model fit resulted in selecting a combination of age, sex, and different 3-protein biomarker panels highly correlated with delirium at PREOP (angiopoietin-2, ANGPT2; C-C motif chemokine 5, CCL5; and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, TIMP1; AUC=0.829) and POD2 (lipocalin-2, LCN2; neurofilament light chain, NFL; and CCL5; AUC=0.845). The delirium-associated proteins identified as biomarker candidates are involved with inflammation, glial dysfunction, vascularization, and hemostasis, highlighting the multifactorial pathophysiology of delirium. Conclusion: Our study proposes two models of postoperative delirium that include a combination of older age, female sex, and altered levels of proteins both preoperatively and postoperatively. Our results support the identification of patients at higher risk of developing postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and provide insights on the underlying pathophysiology.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIComprehensive proteomics screening of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and its association with the development of postoperative delirium.
C_LIO_LIWe propose two different multivariable models: the first model inputs information on risk factors for developing postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, which could be used clinically to preoperatively predict those patients at higher risk; and the second model informs on postoperative proteomic signatures that bring light to delirium pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms for further investigation.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTranscatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve (MV) repair (TEER) is an effective treatment for patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR) at prohibitive risk for surgical MV repair (MVr). High volume MVr centers and high volume TEER centers have better outcomes than low volume centers, respectively. However little is known about whether MVr volume, and specifically complex MVr volume, predicts TEER outcomes. We hypothesized that high volume MV surgical centers would have superior risk-adjusted outcomes for TEER than tlow volume centers.

MethodsWe combined data from the ACC/STS TVT registry and the STS adult cardiac surgery database. Complex MVr, defined as leaflet resection or artificial chords with or without annuloplasty was evaluated as a continuous variable and as pre-defined categories (&lt;25, 25-49 and [&amp;ge;] 50 MV repairs/year). A generalized linear mixed model was used to evaluate risk-adjusted in-hospital/30-day mortality, 30 day HF readmission and TEER success (MR [&amp;le;] 2&#43; and gradient &lt; 5 mmHg).

ResultsThe study comprised 41,834 patients from 500 sites. TEER mortality at 30-days was 3.5% with no significant difference across MVr volume on unadjusted (p=0.141) or adjusted (p=0.071) analysis of volume as a continuous variable. One-year mortality was 15.0% and was lower for higher MVr volume centers when adjusted for clinical and demographic variables (p=0.027). HF readmission at one year was 9.4% and was statistically significantly lower in high volume centers on both unadjusted (p=0.017) or adjusted (p-0.015) analysis. TEER success was 54.6% and was not statistically significantly different across MV surgical site volumes (p=0.4271).

ConclusionsTEER can be safely performed in centers with low volumes of complex MV repair. However, one-year mortality and HF readmission are superior at centers with higher MVr volume.</p>
