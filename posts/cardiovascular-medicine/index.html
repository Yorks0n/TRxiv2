The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem. MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression. Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (\"Loss-of-function\", 0-10% activity; \"defective\", 10-30%; \"mildly-defective\", 30-70%; and \"non-defective\", \u003e 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants. ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making. Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.\nThe relationship between low levels of albuminuria and cardiovascular mortality among apparently healthy adults\nAuthors: Claudel, S. E.; Waikar, S.; Schmidt, I. M.; Vasan, R. S.; Verma, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300378\nBackgroundAlbuminuria is associated with cardiovascular events among adults with underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes, even at low levels of urinary albumin excretion. We hypothesized that low levels of albuminuria in the normal range (urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR) \u003c30 mg/g) are associated with cardiovascular death among apparently healthy adults. MethodsWe studied adults who participated in the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We excluded participants with baseline cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u003c60ml/min/1.73m2, those who were currently pregnant, and those who had received dialysis in the last year. After excluding these conditions, only 5.0% of the remaining population had UACR [\u0026ge;]30 mg/g (N=873) and were excluded. The final sample size was 16,247. We assessed the relationship between UACR and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, health insurance, food insecurity, serum albumin, body mass index, use of statins, and eGFR. ResultsMean age was 38.9 years (SD 13.6) and 53.7% were women. The median length of follow-up was 12.2 years. In multivariable-adjusted models, each doubling of UACR (within the \u003c30 mg/g range) was associated with a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.65)] and a 28% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.28 (95%CI 1.17-1.41)]. The highest tertile of UACR (7.1-29.9 mg/g) was associated with an 87% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.87 (95%CI 1.20-2.92)] and 59% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.59 (95%CI 1.28-1.96)], compared with the lowest tertile (\u003c 4.3 mg/g). ConclusionsIn a nationally representative sample of relatively healthy community-dwelling adults, higher levels of albuminuria in the conventionally \"normal\" range \u003c30 mg/g in healthy individuals are associated with greater mortality. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the existence of a risk gradient across all levels of albuminuria, even in the so-called normal range.\nArtificial intelligence for ventricular arrhythmia capability using ambulatory electrocardiograms\nAuthors: Barker, J.; Li, X.; Kotb, A.; Mavilakandy, A.; Antoun, I.; Thaitirarot, C.; Koev, I.; Man, S.; Sclindwein, F. S.; Dhutia, H.; Chin, S. H.; Tyukin, I.; Nicolson, W. B.; Ng, G. A.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300017\nLay AbstractO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan artificial intelligence (AI) be used to predict if a person is at risk of a lethal heart rhythm, based solely on an electrocardiogram (an electrical heart tracing)? FindingsIn a study of 270 adults (of which 159 had lethal arrhythmias), the AI was correct in 4 out of every 5 cases. If the AI said a person was at risk, the risk of lethal event was three times higher than normal adults. MeaningIn this study, the AI performed better than current medical guidelines. The AI was able accurately determine the risk of lethal arrhythmia from standard heart tracings over a year away which is a conceptual shift in what an AI model can see and predict. This method shows promise in better allocating implantable shock box pacemakers (ICDs) that saves lives. Scientific AbstractO_ST_ABSAimC_ST_ABSCurrent clinical practice guidelines for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are insufficiently accurate for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) risk stratification leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence offers novel risk stratification lens through which VA capability can be determined from electrocardiogram in normal sinus rhythm. The aim was to develop and test a deep neural network for VA risk stratification using routinely collected ambulatory electrocardiograms. MethodsA multicentre case-control study was undertaken to assess VA-ResNet-50, our open source ResNet-50 based deep neural network. VA-ResNet-50 was designed to read pyramid samples of 3-lead 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to decide if a heart is capable of VA based on the electrocardiogram alone. Consecutive adults with VA from East Midlands, UK, who had ambulatory electrocardiograms as part of their NHS care between 2014 and 2022 were recruited and compared to all comer ambulatory electrocardiograms without VA. ResultsOf 270 patients, 159 heterogeneous patients had a composite VA outcome. The mean time difference between the electrocardiogram and VA was 1.6 years ([1/3] ambulatory electrocardiogram before VA). The deep neural network was able to classify electrocardiograms for VA capability with an accuracy of 0.76 (CI 95% 0.66 - 0.87), F1 score of 0.79 (0.67 - 0.90), AUC of 0.8 (0.67 - 0.91) and RR of 2.87 (1.41 - 5.81). ConclusionAmbulatory electrocardiograms confer risk signals for VA risk stratification when analysed using VA-ResNet-50. Pyramid sampling from the ambulatory electrocardiograms is hypothesised to capture autonomic activity. We encourage groups to build on this open-source model.\nIntegrative proteomic analyses across common cardiac diseases yield new mechanistic insights and enhanced prediction\nAuthors: Schuermans, A.; Pournamdari, A. B.; Lee, J.; Bhukar, R.; Ganesh, S.; Darosa, N.; Small, A. M.; Yu, Z.; Hornsby, W.; Koyama, S.; Januzzi, J. L.; Honigberg, M. C.; Natarajan, P.\nScore: 27.3, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300218\nCardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P\u003c8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.\nLDLR Variant Classification for Improved Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Familial Hypercholesterolemia\nAuthors: Ibrahim, S.; Hartgers, M. L.; Reeskamp, L. F.; Zuurbier, L.; Defesche, J. C.; Kastelein, J. J. P.; Stroes, E. S.; Hovingh, G. K.; Huijgen, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300621\nBackground Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder marked by high LDL cholesterol and an increased premature coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Current dichotomous classification of LDL receptor gene (LDLR) variants may inadequately capture patient variability in LDL cholesterol levels and CAD risk. This study assessed a novel approach for assessing LDLR variant severity using variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles. Methods Participants of the Dutch FH cascade screening program were screened for 456 LDLR variants. Sex- and age-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles were computed for each LDLR variant carrier. These percentiles were used to calculate the mean LDL cholesterol percentile for each variant. Based on the variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles, carriers were grouped into the following strata: \u003c75th, 75th-88th, 88th-92nd, 92nd-96.5th, 96.5th-98th, and ?98th percentile. Additionally, variants were categorized into class 1 (LDLR deficient) and non-class 1 (often LDLR defective) variants. CAD risk between carriers in the different strata and non-carriers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results Out of 35,257 participants, 12,485 (36%) LDLR variant carriers were identified. Carriers had a 5-fold higher CAD risk compared with non-carriers. Hazard ratios for CAD increased gradually from 2.2 (95%CI 0.97-5.0) to 12.0 (95%CI 5.5-24.8) across the strata. A 7.3-fold and 3.9-fold increased CAD risk was observed in carriers of class 1 and non-class 1 LDLR variants, respectively. Conclusions This study presents a refined approach for classifying LDLR variants based on their impact on LDL cholesterol levels, allowing for more precise, genotype-specific CAD risk estimation in FH patients compared with traditional methods.\nIdentification of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy on Electrocardiographic Images with Deep Learning\nAuthors: Sangha, V.; Dhingra, L. S.; Oikonomou, E. K.; Aminorroaya, A.; Sikand, N. V.; Sen, S.; Krumholz, H. M.; Khera, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.23300490\nBackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts. MethodsWe identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness \u003e 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. ResultsOverall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5). ConclusionsWe developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM.\nIn-hospital Outcomes of Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients on Anticoagulation: A Retrospective Analysis\nAuthors: Vasquez, M. A.; Lambrakos, L. K.; Velasquez, A.; Goldberger, J.; Mitrani, R. D.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300418\nBackgroundLong-term anticoagulation (AC) therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Data on the impact of AC on in-hospital stroke outcomes is lacking. MethodsThe National Inpatient Sample was used to identify adult inpatients with AF and a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke between 2016 and 2020. Data was stratified between patients on AC users and nonusers. A multivariate regression model was used to describe the in-hospital outcomes, adjusting for significant comorbidities. ResultsA total of 655,540 patients with AF and a diagnosis of ischemic stroke were included, of which 194,560 (29.7%) were on long-term AC. Patients on AC tended to be younger (mean age, 77 vs 78), had a higher average CHA2DS2VASc score (4.48 vs 4.20), higher rates of hypertension (91% vs 88%), hyperlipidemia (64% vs 59%), and heart failure (34% vs 30%) compared to patients not on long-term AC. Use of AC was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (aOR [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.60 - 0.63]), decreased stroke severity (mean NIHSS, 8 vs 10), decreased use of tPA (aOR 0.42 [0.41 - 0.43]), mechanical thrombectomy (aOR 0.85 [0.83 - 0.87]), hemorrhagic conversion (aOR 0.69 [0.67 - 0.70]), gastrointestinal bleeding (aOR 0.74 [0.70 - 0.77]), and discharge to skilled nursing facilities (aOR 0.90 [0.89 - 0.91]), compared to patients not on AC (P\u003c0.001 for all comparisons). ConclusionAmong patients with AF admitted with acute ischemic stroke, AC use prior to stroke was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality, decreased stroke severity, decreased discharge to SNF, and fewer stroke-related and bleeding complications.\n",

        <p class="abstract">AimsLack of functional information for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mutations limits the use of genetics for early diagnosis, risk assessment and clinical decision making in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem.

MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression.

Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (&#34;Loss-of-function&#34;, 0-10% activity; &#34;defective&#34;, 10-30%; &#34;mildly-defective&#34;, 30-70%; and &#34;non-defective&#34;, &gt; 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants.

ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making.

Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlbuminuria is associated with cardiovascular events among adults with underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes, even at low levels of urinary albumin excretion. We hypothesized that low levels of albuminuria in the  normal range (urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR) &lt;30 mg/g) are associated with cardiovascular death among apparently healthy adults.

MethodsWe studied adults who participated in the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We excluded participants with baseline cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60ml/min/1.73m2, those who were currently pregnant, and those who had received dialysis in the last year. After excluding these conditions, only 5.0% of the remaining population had UACR [&amp;ge;]30 mg/g (N=873) and were excluded. The final sample size was 16,247. We assessed the relationship between UACR and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, health insurance, food insecurity, serum albumin, body mass index, use of statins, and eGFR.

ResultsMean age was 38.9 years (SD 13.6) and 53.7% were women. The median length of follow-up was 12.2 years. In multivariable-adjusted models, each doubling of UACR (within the &lt;30 mg/g range) was associated with a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.65)] and a 28% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.28 (95%CI 1.17-1.41)]. The highest tertile of UACR (7.1-29.9 mg/g) was associated with an 87% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.87 (95%CI 1.20-2.92)] and 59% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.59 (95%CI 1.28-1.96)], compared with the lowest tertile (&lt; 4.3 mg/g).

ConclusionsIn a nationally representative sample of relatively healthy community-dwelling adults, higher levels of albuminuria in the conventionally &#34;normal&#34; range &lt;30 mg/g in healthy individuals are associated with greater mortality. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the existence of a risk gradient across all levels of albuminuria, even in the so-called normal range.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lay AbstractO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan artificial intelligence (AI) be used to predict if a person is at risk of a lethal heart rhythm, based solely on an electrocardiogram (an electrical heart tracing)?

FindingsIn a study of 270 adults (of which 159 had lethal arrhythmias), the AI was correct in 4 out of every 5 cases. If the AI said a person was at risk, the risk of lethal event was three times higher than normal adults.

MeaningIn this study, the AI performed better than current medical guidelines. The AI was able accurately determine the risk of lethal arrhythmia from standard heart tracings over a year away which is a conceptual shift in what an AI model can see and predict. This method shows promise in better allocating implantable shock box pacemakers (ICDs) that saves lives.

Scientific AbstractO_ST_ABSAimC_ST_ABSCurrent clinical practice guidelines for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are insufficiently accurate for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) risk stratification leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence offers novel risk stratification lens through which VA capability can be determined from electrocardiogram in normal sinus rhythm. The aim was to develop and test a deep neural network for VA risk stratification using routinely collected ambulatory electrocardiograms.

MethodsA multicentre case-control study was undertaken to assess VA-ResNet-50, our open source ResNet-50 based deep neural network. VA-ResNet-50 was designed to read pyramid samples of 3-lead 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to decide if a heart is capable of VA based on the electrocardiogram alone. Consecutive adults with VA from East Midlands, UK, who had ambulatory electrocardiograms as part of their NHS care between 2014 and 2022 were recruited and compared to all comer ambulatory electrocardiograms without VA.

ResultsOf 270 patients, 159 heterogeneous patients had a composite VA outcome. The mean time difference between the electrocardiogram and VA was 1.6 years ([1/3] ambulatory electrocardiogram before VA). The deep neural network was able to classify electrocardiograms for VA capability with an accuracy of 0.76 (CI 95% 0.66 - 0.87), F1 score of 0.79 (0.67 - 0.90), AUC of 0.8 (0.67 - 0.91) and RR of 2.87 (1.41 - 5.81).

ConclusionAmbulatory electrocardiograms confer risk signals for VA risk stratification when analysed using VA-ResNet-50. Pyramid sampling from the ambulatory electrocardiograms is hypothesised to capture autonomic activity. We encourage groups to build on this open-source model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P&lt;8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder marked by high LDL cholesterol and an increased premature coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Current dichotomous classification of LDL receptor gene (LDLR) variants may inadequately capture patient variability in LDL cholesterol levels and CAD risk. This study assessed a novel approach for assessing LDLR variant severity using variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles. Methods Participants of the Dutch FH cascade screening program were screened for 456 LDLR variants. Sex- and age-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles were computed for each LDLR variant carrier. These percentiles were used to calculate the mean LDL cholesterol percentile for each variant. Based on the variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles, carriers were grouped into the following strata: &lt;75th, 75th-88th, 88th-92nd, 92nd-96.5th, 96.5th-98th, and ?98th percentile. Additionally, variants were categorized into class 1 (LDLR deficient) and non-class 1 (often LDLR defective) variants. CAD risk between carriers in the different strata and non-carriers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results Out of 35,257 participants, 12,485 (36%) LDLR variant carriers were identified. Carriers had a 5-fold higher CAD risk compared with non-carriers. Hazard ratios for CAD increased gradually from 2.2 (95%CI 0.97-5.0) to 12.0 (95%CI 5.5-24.8) across the strata. A 7.3-fold and 3.9-fold increased CAD risk was observed in carriers of class 1 and non-class 1 LDLR variants, respectively. Conclusions This study presents a refined approach for classifying LDLR variants based on their impact on LDL cholesterol levels, allowing for more precise, genotype-specific CAD risk estimation in FH patients compared with traditional methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts.

MethodsWe identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness &gt; 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping.

ResultsOverall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5).

ConclusionsWe developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong-term anticoagulation (AC) therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Data on the impact of AC on in-hospital stroke outcomes is lacking.

MethodsThe National Inpatient Sample was used to identify adult inpatients with AF and a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke between 2016 and 2020. Data was stratified between patients on AC users and nonusers. A multivariate regression model was used to describe the in-hospital outcomes, adjusting for significant comorbidities.

ResultsA total of 655,540 patients with AF and a diagnosis of ischemic stroke were included, of which 194,560 (29.7%) were on long-term AC. Patients on AC tended to be younger (mean age, 77 vs 78), had a higher average CHA2DS2VASc score (4.48 vs 4.20), higher rates of hypertension (91% vs 88%), hyperlipidemia (64% vs 59%), and heart failure (34% vs 30%) compared to patients not on long-term AC. Use of AC was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (aOR [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.60 - 0.63]), decreased stroke severity (mean NIHSS, 8 vs 10), decreased use of tPA (aOR 0.42 [0.41 - 0.43]), mechanical thrombectomy (aOR 0.85 [0.83 - 0.87]), hemorrhagic conversion (aOR 0.69 [0.67 - 0.70]), gastrointestinal bleeding (aOR 0.74 [0.70 - 0.77]), and discharge to skilled nursing facilities (aOR 0.90 [0.89 - 0.91]), compared to patients not on AC (P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons).

ConclusionAmong patients with AF admitted with acute ischemic stroke, AC use prior to stroke was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality, decreased stroke severity, decreased discharge to SNF, and fewer stroke-related and bleeding complications.</p>
