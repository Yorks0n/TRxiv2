We examined how the ACS burden has evolved among persons aged 35-74 in Finland from 1996 to 2021. MethodsWe used Finnish country-wide Hospital Discharge- and Causes of Death-Registers covering first non-fatal and fatal ACS events, totaling 69 906 442 person-years at risk. We analyzed incidence, mortality, and 28-day CF, and their trends using negative binomial, Poisson, segmented, and logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. ResultsAltogether, the analysis consisted of 186 489 non-fatal and 72 907 fatal ACS events. ACS incidence declined in men (annual percentage change (APC) -2.0% [95% CI -2.2 to -1.8]) and in older women (APC of 55-64 year old -1.5% [-1.7 to -1.2] and 65-74 year old -3.3% [-3.4 to -3.2]), but the incidence decline slowed down over the last decade. In younger women aged 35-54, incidence was unchanged during the study period. ACS mortality and CF declined (APC of the mortality in men - 4.4% [-4.6 to -4.2] and in women -5.0% [-5.2 to -4.7]. APC of CF in men -2.7% [-2.8 to -2.6] and in women -3.3% [-3.6 to -3.1]). ConclusionsACS mortality declined in all groups, but the decline in ACS incidence slowed down and even halted in women. In women aged 35-54, the incidence was unchanged during the study period. These results emphasize the need of intensified cardiovascular prevention, particularly in women. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSDuring the last decades coronary artery disease treatment and prevention have improved worldwide which has led to a decline in ACS mortality and case fatality. However, recent studies from several countries suggest, that incidence decline has stagnated or even turned to increase, especially in younger age cohorts. What this study addsThis study showed that incidence has ceased its decline in women aged 35-54 and has slowed down in older age groups. Together with declining mortality this results in a growing number of patients living with cardiovascular disease leading to increased healthcare costs. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe alarming results of this study underline the importance of intensifying prevention, focusing especially on young and middle-aged women.\nMechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in Long COVID: an accumulation of multi-system dysfunction\nAuthors: Jamieson, A.; Al Saikhan, L.; Alghamdi, L.; Hamill Howes, L.; Purcell, H.; Hillman, T.; Heightman, M. J.; Treibel, T. A.; Orini, M.; Bell, R. M.; Scully, M.; Hamer, M.; Chaturvedi, N.; Hughes, A.; Astin, R.; Jones, S.\nScore: 37.3, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23299429\nThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood. Cases were recruited from a Long COVID clinic (N=32; 44{+/-}12y; 10(31%)men), and age/sex- matched healthy controls (HC) (N=19; 40{+/-}13y; 6(32%)men) from University College London staff and students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups using potential outcome means(95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values. When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (1847(1679,2016) vs (2176(1978,2373) ml/min, p=0.002) and Anaerobic Threshold (13.2(12.2,14.3) vs 15.6(14.4,17.2) ml/Kg/min, p\u003c0.001), and lower oxidative capacity on near infrared spectroscopy ({tau}: 38.7(31.9,45.6) vs 24.6(19.1,30.1) seconds, p=0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%. Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation in a significant proportion. These multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers. Key PointsO_LIThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood. C_LIO_LIWe show that Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance in line with previous work. C_LIO_LIIn Long COVID cases, we observed reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. C_LIO_LIWe also observed evidence of attendant autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation in a significant proportion of Long COVID cases. C_LIO_LIThese multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers.

M.; Verma, A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299886\nBackground and AimsThe performance of high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), hs-cTnI, and N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood. MethodsWe included adults with CKD (eGFR\u003c60 ml/min/1.73m2) in the 1999-2004 NHANES. We calculated the 99th percentile of hs-cTnT, hs-cTnI (Abbott, Ortho, and Siemens assays), and NT-proBNP, measured the association between eGFR and cardiac biomarker concentration, and used Cox regression models to assess the relationship between cardiac biomarkers and CVD mortality. ResultsAcross 1,068 adults with CKD, the mean [SD] age was 71.9[12.7] years and 61.2% were female; 78.8% had elevated NT-proBNP and 42.6% had elevated hs-cTnT based on traditional clinical reference limits. The 99th percentile of hs-cTnT was 122 ng/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 101-143), hs-cTnIAbbott was 69 ng/L (95% CI 38-99), and NT-proBNP was 8952 pg/mL (95% CI 7506-10,399). A 10 ml/min decrease in eGFR was associated with greater increases in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP than hs-cTnI (hs-cTnT: 27.5% increase ({beta}=27.5, 95% CI 28.2-43.3)), NT-proBNP 46.0% increase ({beta}=46.0, 95% CI 36.0-56.8), hs-cTnISiemens 17.9% ({beta}=17.9, 95% CI 9.7-26.7). Each doubling of hs-cTnT, hs-cTnI, and NT-proBNP were associated with CVD mortality (hs-cTnT HR 1.62 [95% CI 1.32-1.98], p\u003c0.0001; hs-cTnISiemens HR 1.40 [95% CI 1.26-1.55], p\u003c0.0001; NT-proBNP HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.19-1.41], p\u003c0.0001). Conclusions and RelevanceCommunity dwelling adults with CKD have elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers, above established reference ranges. Of the troponin assays, hs-cTnI concentration appears to be most stable across eGFR categories and is associated with CVD mortality. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis study investigated two important questions relevant to clinical practice. First, which cardiac biomarker (hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI) and which assay is least impacted eGFR in patients with CKD. Second, whether elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers in community-dwelling patients convey prognostic information in CKD in a more representative population. C_LIO_LICommunity dwelling adults with CKD have elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers, above established reference ranges. Of the troponin assays, hs-CTnI concentration appears to be most stable across the eGFR categories and is associated with CVD mortality in individuals with CKD. C_LI What are the clinical implications?O_LICommunity dwelling adults with CKD had elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers suggestive of subclinical myocardial injury, which were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death. C_LIO_LIhs-cTnI was least affected by eGFR and retained prognostic significance, suggesting that it may be the superior assay for clinical use in CKD. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) incidence and case fatality (CF) have declined in the past decades, but some studies have suggested a potential stagnation in this decline. We examined how the ACS burden has evolved among persons aged 35-74 in Finland from 1996 to 2021.

What this study addsThis study showed that incidence has ceased its decline in women aged 35-54 and has slowed down in older age groups. Together with declining mortality this results in a growing number of patients living with cardiovascular disease leading to increased healthcare costs.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe alarming results of this study underline the importance of intensifying prevention, focusing especially on young and middle-aged women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood.

Cases were recruited from a Long COVID clinic (N=32; 44{&#43;/-}12y; 10(31%)men), and age/sex- matched healthy controls (HC) (N=19; 40{&#43;/-}13y; 6(32%)men) from University College London staff and students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups using potential outcome means(95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values.

When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (1847(1679,2016) vs (2176(1978,2373) ml/min, p=0.002) and Anaerobic Threshold (13.2(12.2,14.3) vs 15.6(14.4,17.2) ml/Kg/min, p&lt;0.001), and lower oxidative capacity on near infrared spectroscopy ({tau}: 38.7(31.9,45.6) vs 24.6(19.1,30.1) seconds, p=0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%.

Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation in a significant proportion. These multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers.

Key PointsO_LIThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood.
C_LIO_LIWe show that Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance in line with previous work.
C_LIO_LIIn Long COVID cases, we observed reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology.
C_LIO_LIWe also observed evidence of attendant autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation in a significant proportion of Long COVID cases.

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsThe performance of high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), hs-cTnI, and N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood.

MethodsWe included adults with CKD (eGFR&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2) in the 1999-2004 NHANES. We calculated the 99th percentile of hs-cTnT, hs-cTnI (Abbott, Ortho, and Siemens assays), and NT-proBNP, measured the association between eGFR and cardiac biomarker concentration, and used Cox regression models to assess the relationship between cardiac biomarkers and CVD mortality.

ResultsAcross 1,068 adults with CKD, the mean [SD] age was 71.9[12.7] years and 61.2% were female; 78.8% had elevated NT-proBNP and 42.6% had elevated hs-cTnT based on traditional clinical reference limits. The 99th percentile of hs-cTnT was 122 ng/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 101-143), hs-cTnIAbbott was 69 ng/L (95% CI 38-99), and NT-proBNP was 8952 pg/mL (95% CI 7506-10,399). A 10 ml/min decrease in eGFR was associated with greater increases in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP than hs-cTnI (hs-cTnT: 27.5% increase ({beta}=27.5, 95% CI 28.2-43.3)), NT-proBNP 46.0% increase ({beta}=46.0, 95% CI 36.0-56.8), hs-cTnISiemens 17.9% ({beta}=17.9, 95% CI 9.7-26.7). Each doubling of hs-cTnT, hs-cTnI, and NT-proBNP were associated with CVD mortality (hs-cTnT HR 1.62 [95% CI 1.32-1.98], p&lt;0.0001; hs-cTnISiemens HR 1.40 [95% CI 1.26-1.55], p&lt;0.0001; NT-proBNP HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.19-1.41], p&lt;0.0001).

Conclusions and RelevanceCommunity dwelling adults with CKD have elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers, above established reference ranges. Of the troponin assays, hs-cTnI concentration appears to be most stable across eGFR categories and is associated with CVD mortality.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis study investigated two important questions relevant to clinical practice. First, which cardiac biomarker (hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI) and which assay is least impacted eGFR in patients with CKD. Second, whether elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers in community-dwelling patients convey prognostic information in CKD in a more representative population.
C_LIO_LICommunity dwelling adults with CKD have elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers, above established reference ranges. Of the troponin assays, hs-CTnI concentration appears to be most stable across the eGFR categories and is associated with CVD mortality in individuals with CKD.

What are the clinical implications?O_LICommunity dwelling adults with CKD had elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers suggestive of subclinical myocardial injury, which were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death.
C_LIO_LIhs-cTnI was least affected by eGFR and retained prognostic significance, suggesting that it may be the superior assay for clinical use in CKD.
