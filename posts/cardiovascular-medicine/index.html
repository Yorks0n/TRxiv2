The large language model (LLM), Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), may be a useful supplemental resource of information for patients with heart failure. MethodsResponses produced by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to 107 frequently asked heart failure-related questions were graded by two reviewers board-certified in cardiology, with differences resolved by a third reviewer. The reproducibility and accuracy between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were compared for questions involving basic knowledge, management, prognosis, procedures, and support. ResultsGPT-4 displayed a greater proportion of comprehensive knowledge for the categories of \" basic knowledge\" and \" management\", while GPT-3.5 performed better in the \" other\" category (prognosis, procedures, and support) (94.1% vs 64.7%). There were 2 total responses (1.9%) graded as \" some correct and incorrect\" for GPT-3.5, while no GPT-4 responses received a grade of \" some correct and incorrect\" or \" completely incorrect\". Both models provided highly reproducible responses, with GPT-3.5 scoring above 94% in every category and GPT-4 with 100% for all answers. ConclusionsBoth GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 answered the majority of heart failure-related questions accurately and reliably, with GPT-4 displaying superior performance overall.

V.; Oelen, R.; Groot, H. E.; Benjamins, J. W.; Pekayvaz, K. A.; Losert, C.; Knottenberg, V.; Heinig, M.; Nicolai, L.; van der Harst, P.; Franke, L. H.; van der Wijst, M. G. P.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.02.23289370\nThe role of the immune system during and in response to acute myocardial infarction (MI) is poorly characterized but is an important driver of recurrent cardiovascular events. Anti-inflammatory drugs have shown promising effects on lowering this recurrency risk, but broadly impair the immune system and may induce severe side effects. To overcome these challenges a more detailed understanding of the immune response to myocardial infarction is needed. For this, we compared peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) single-cell RNA-sequencing expression and plasma protein profiles over time (hospital admission, 24h and 6-8 weeks after STEMI) and in comparison to controls (95,995 diseased and 33,878 control PBMCs). Compared to controls, we observed a relative increase in classical monocytes and a decrease in CD56dim natural killer cells in STEMI patients at admission, and these differences persisted until 24h after STEMI. The monocytes also showed the largest gene expression changes in each of the conditions, which was associated with changes in toll-like receptor, IFN and IL-1 signaling activity. Finally, a targeted protein cardiovascular biomarker panel revealed 33/92 plasma proteins to be changed after STEMI. Interestingly, three of these proteins were found to be affected by coronary artery disease-associated genetic risk variation, disease status and time after STEMI. Indicating the importance of taking all these aspects into consideration when defining potential future therapies. Altogether, our analyses have revealed the immunological pathways that are disturbed upon MI, and in which cell type and during which stage of the disease this occurs. Additionally, we also provide insights in which patients are expected to benefit most from anti-inflammatory treatments, by identifying the genetic variants and disease stage at which these variants affect the outcome of these (drug-targeted) pathways. These findings advance our knowledge of the immune response after MI and provide further guidance for future therapeutic studies.\n",
