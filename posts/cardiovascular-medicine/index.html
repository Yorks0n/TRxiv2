C_FIG\nProspective Clinical Evaluation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Guided Point-of-Care Ultrasonography Screening of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\nAuthors: Chiu, I.-M.; Chen, T.-Y.; Zheng, Y.-C.; Lin, X.-H.; Cheng, F.-J.; Ouyang, D.; Cheng, C.-Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.24302423\nBackgroundAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a critical condition that can lead to fatal consequences if not detected and treated early. Despite the high prevalence in smokers and guideline recommendation for screening, AAA often remains undetected due to availability of diagnostic ultrasound examinations. This prospective clinical trial aimed to investigate the use of a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm to guide AAA screening. MethodsThis prospective, comparative diagnostic study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We developed and deployed an object detection-based DL algorithm providing real-time guidance for novice users performing AAA screening using point of care ultrasound. 10 registered nurses with no prior ultrasonography experience were recruited and performed at least 15 scans on patients over 65 years old to acquire abdominal aorta videos. These scans were compared with those of physicians using the same ultrasound hardware but without DL guidance. ResultsA total of 184 patients (median [IQR] age of 72 [67-79], and 105 (57.1%) male) completed this study. The DL-guided novices achieved adequate scan quality in 87.5% (95% CI: 82.7 - 92.3%) of patients, comparable to the 91.3% (95% CI: 87.2-95.4%) rate of physician scans (p=0.310). This performance did not vary by BMI. The DL model predicted AAA with an AUC of 0.975, showing 100% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity. The DL model predicted the maximal width of abdominal aorta with mean absolute error of 2.8mm compared to physician measurements. 3 AAA with maximal width of aorta \u003e 3cm were found in this study cohort. ConclusionDL-guided POCUS is an effective tool for AAA screening, providing comparable performance to experienced physicians. The use of this DL system could democratize AAA screening and improve access, thereby aiding in early disease detection and treatment. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is NewC_ST_ABSO_LIOur study presents a deep learning (DL) guidance system that enables novice users to perform Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening with POCUS, yielding image quality comparable to experienced physicians. C_LIO_LIThe DL algorithm accurately identifies AAA from scans conducted by novice users, maintains consistent performance across patients with varying BMIs, and demonstrates increased scan efficiency with repeated use. C_LI Clinical ImplicationsO_LIDL-guided POCUS can potentially expand AAA screening capabilities to non-specialist settings and increase throughput for screening at risk individuals. C_LIO_LIThe implementation of our DL model for AAA screening could enhance early detection, particularly in underserved areas, but also optimize clinical workflows by decreasing diagnostic wait times and increasing ultrasound utilization efficiency. C_LI\nTreadmill Exercise Stress Echocardiography Exposes Impaired Left Ventricular Function in Patients Recovering from Hospitalization with COVID-19 Without Overt Myocarditis Versus Historical Controls\nAuthors: Goldstein, R. E.; Hulten, E.; Arnold, T. B.; Thomas, V. M.; Heroy, A.; Walker, E. N.; Fox, K.; Lee, H.; Libbus, J.; Marcos, B.; Hood, M. N.; Harrell, T. E.; Haigney, M. C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24302037\nBackgroundUsual clinical testing rarely reveals cardiac abnormalities persisting after hospitalization for COVID-19. Such testing may overlook residual changes responsible for increased adverse cardiac events post-discharge. MethodsTo further elucidate long-term status, we performed exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) in 15 patients age 30-63 without myocarditis 3 to 31 months after hospital discharge. We compared patient outcomes to published data in healthy comparisons (HC) exercising according to the same protocol. ResultsPatients treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol), averaging 8.2 min, was halted by dyspnea or fatigue. Pre-stress baselines in recovering patients (RP) matched HC except for higher heart rate: mean 81 bpm for RP and 63 for HC (p\u003c0.0001). At peak stress, RP had significantly lower mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (67% vs 73%, p\u003c0.0017) and higher peak early mitral inflow velocity/early mitral annular velocity (E/e, 9.1 vs 6.6, p\u003c0.006) compared with HC performing equal exercise (8.5 min). Thus, when stressed, patients without known cardiac impairment showed modest but consistently diminished systolic contractile function and diastolic LV compliance during recovery vs HC. Peak HR during stress was significantly elevated in RP vs HC; peak SBP also trended higher. Average pulmonary artery systolic pressures among RP remained normal. ConclusionsOur measurements during ESE uniquely identified residual abnormality in cardiac contractile function not evident in the unstressed condition. This finding exposes a previously-unrecognized residual influence of COVID-19, possibly related to underlying autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, or diffuse interstitial changes after subclinical myocarditis; it may have long-term implications for clinical management and later prognosis. CLINICAL PERSPECTIVENew Findings (relative to a historical comparison group) O_LISymptom-limited treadmill exercise 3-31 months after hospitalization with COVID-19 without overt myocarditis elicited a lesser rise in left ventricular ejection fraction than seen in similar subjects with no exposure to COVID-19. C_LIO_LIThe same symptom-limited exercise in these patients revealed evidence of diminished left ventricular diastolic function relative to subjects with no exposure to COVID-19. C_LIO_LIThese distinctive differences in left ventricular function were observed although overall exercise capacity was the same as in the uninfected comparison group. C_LI Clinical Implications O_LIPrior hospitalization with COVID-19 even in the absence of overt myocarditis was often associated with a modest but consistent decrement in left ventricular systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation; these functional abnormalities were evident after peak treadmill exercise stress despite lack of distinctive difference in contractile parameters at rest. C_LIO_LIPatients recovering after hospitalization with COVID-19 may benefit from sustained observation of their cardiovascular status and adjustment of their exercise requirements appropriate to individual cardiovascular capabilities. C_LIO_LITreadmill stress testing with echocardiography uniquely identifies potentially important differences in the cardiovascular function of patients recovering after hospitalization with COVID-19.

Predicted ECV may foster the design of phase 3 trials targeting MF with higher numbers of screened and enrolled participants, but with simplified eligibility criteria, avoiding the complexity of tomographic imaging.

Structured Graphical AbstractO_ST_ABSKey QuestionC_ST_ABSPhase 3 trials targeting myocardial fibrosis (MF) to improve outcomes require MF measurement that does not rely on tomographic imaging with intravenous contrast. So, we developed and validated extracellular volume (ECV) prediction models incorporating clinical data, excluding tomographic imaging.

Key FindingPredicted ECV had reasonable discrimination and associated with outcomes. For a hypothetical trial with an ECV [&amp;ge;]27% inclusion criterion, using predicted ECV versus measured ECV would avoid 3940 cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scans, but require an additional 3052 participants screened and 705 enrolled.

Take-home MessagePredicted ECV (derived without imaging) associates with outcomes and efficiently identifies vulnerable patients. Predicted ECV may foster phase 3 trials targeting MF with higher numbers of screened and enrolled participants, but simplified eligibility criteria, avoiding the complexity of tomographic imaging.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a critical condition that can lead to fatal consequences if not detected and treated early. Despite the high prevalence in smokers and guideline recommendation for screening, AAA often remains undetected due to availability of diagnostic ultrasound examinations. This prospective clinical trial aimed to investigate the use of a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm to guide AAA screening.

MethodsThis prospective, comparative diagnostic study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We developed and deployed an object detection-based DL algorithm providing real-time guidance for novice users performing AAA screening using point of care ultrasound. 10 registered nurses with no prior ultrasonography experience were recruited and performed at least 15 scans on patients over 65 years old to acquire abdominal aorta videos. These scans were compared with those of physicians using the same ultrasound hardware but without DL guidance.

ResultsA total of 184 patients (median [IQR] age of 72 [67-79], and 105 (57.1%) male) completed this study. The DL-guided novices achieved adequate scan quality in 87.5% (95% CI: 82.7 - 92.3%) of patients, comparable to the 91.3% (95% CI: 87.2-95.4%) rate of physician scans (p=0.310). This performance did not vary by BMI. The DL model predicted AAA with an AUC of 0.975, showing 100% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity. The DL model predicted the maximal width of abdominal aorta with mean absolute error of 2.8mm compared to physician measurements. 3 AAA with maximal width of aorta &gt; 3cm were found in this study cohort.

ConclusionDL-guided POCUS is an effective tool for AAA screening, providing comparable performance to experienced physicians. The use of this DL system could democratize AAA screening and improve access, thereby aiding in early disease detection and treatment.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUsual clinical testing rarely reveals cardiac abnormalities persisting after hospitalization for COVID-19. Such testing may overlook residual changes responsible for increased adverse cardiac events post-discharge.

MethodsTo further elucidate long-term status, we performed exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) in 15 patients age 30-63 without myocarditis 3 to 31 months after hospital discharge. We compared patient outcomes to published data in healthy comparisons (HC) exercising according to the same protocol.

ResultsPatients treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol), averaging 8.2 min, was halted by dyspnea or fatigue. Pre-stress baselines in recovering patients (RP) matched HC except for higher heart rate: mean 81 bpm for RP and 63 for HC (p&lt;0.0001). At peak stress, RP had significantly lower mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (67% vs 73%, p&lt;0.0017) and higher peak early mitral inflow velocity/early mitral annular velocity (E/e, 9.1 vs 6.6, p&lt;0.006) compared with HC performing equal exercise (8.5 min). Thus, when stressed, patients without known cardiac impairment showed modest but consistently diminished systolic contractile function and diastolic LV compliance during recovery vs HC. Peak HR during stress was significantly elevated in RP vs HC; peak SBP also trended higher. Average pulmonary artery systolic pressures among RP remained normal.

ConclusionsOur measurements during ESE uniquely identified residual abnormality in cardiac contractile function not evident in the unstressed condition. This finding exposes a previously-unrecognized residual influence of COVID-19, possibly related to underlying autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, or diffuse interstitial changes after subclinical myocarditis; it may have long-term implications for clinical management and later prognosis.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVENew Findings (relative to a historical comparison group)

O_LISymptom-limited treadmill exercise 3-31 months after hospitalization with COVID-19 without overt myocarditis elicited a lesser rise in left ventricular ejection fraction than seen in similar subjects with no exposure to COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThe same symptom-limited exercise in these patients revealed evidence of diminished left ventricular diastolic function relative to subjects with no exposure to COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThese distinctive differences in left ventricular function were observed although overall exercise capacity was the same as in the uninfected comparison group.
C_LI

Clinical Implications

O_LIPrior hospitalization with COVID-19 even in the absence of overt myocarditis was often associated with a modest but consistent decrement in left ventricular systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation; these functional abnormalities were evident after peak treadmill exercise stress despite lack of distinctive difference in contractile parameters at rest.
C_LIO_LIPatients recovering after hospitalization with COVID-19 may benefit from sustained observation of their cardiovascular status and adjustment of their exercise requirements appropriate to individual cardiovascular capabilities.
C_LIO_LITreadmill stress testing with echocardiography uniquely identifies potentially important differences in the cardiovascular function of patients recovering after hospitalization with COVID-19.
