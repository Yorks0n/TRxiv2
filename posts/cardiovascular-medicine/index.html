P.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292729\nBackgroundWhile previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of PAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of PAT in a large population cohort. MethodsA deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber magnetic resonance images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants. ResultsA total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex ({beta} = +0.76 SD in PAT), age (r = 0.15), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.55) (P \u003c 1x10-230). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure ({beta} = +0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes ({beta} = +0.56) than in coronary artery disease ({beta} = +0.22) or AF ({beta} = +0.18). PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per +1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during a mean 3.2 ({+/-}1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We identified 5 novel genetic loci for PAT and implicated transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1, EBF2 and CEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2 and TRIB2). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, heart failure, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per +1 SD in PGS, P \u003c 2x10-10). ConclusionsPAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal adiposity and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Clinical PerspectiveWhat is new? O_LIIn a large, prospective and uniformly phenotyped cohort, pericardial adipose tissue was independently predictive of incident heart failure and type 2 diabetes when adjusted for body mass index. C_LIO_LIIn contrast, pericardial adipose tissue was not independently predictive of atrial fibrillation. C_LIO_LIA genome-wide association study of pericardial adipose tissue identified five novel loci, implicating genes influencing adipocyte morphology, brown-like adipose tissue differentiation and abdominal adiposity. C_LI What are the clinical implications? O_LIPericardial adipose tissue accumulation may reflect a metabolically unhealthy adiposity phenotype similarly to abdominal visceral adiposity.

T.; Idema, D. L.; van Beem, S.; Blokland, A. M.; van der Braak, K.; Handoko, M. L.; Huis in't Veld, L. F.; Kaul, T.; Kolagasigil-Akdemir, N.; Kusters, M. P. T.; Meijvis, S. C. A.; Oosting, I. J.; Spijker, R.; Bots, M.; Hooft, L.; Verhaar, M. C.; Vernooij, R. W. M.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.23292848\nBackgroundPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, but their systematic underrepresentation in cardiovascular randomised controlled trials (RCTs) limits appropriate evidence to guide cardiovascular risk management (CVRM). This systematic review aims to evaluate trends in the underrepresentation of patients with CKD in cardiovascular RCTs in the past 20 years and highlight evidence gaps for CVRM medications in this population. MethodsA systematic search was conducted in ClinicalTrials.gov from its inception in 2000 until October 2021, targeting RCTs evaluating the efficacy of CVRM medications on mortality, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure in adults with cardiovascular disease or one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Two reviewers independently screened references and extracted data. Outcomes were the exclusion rate of patients with CKD over time and an evidence map of studies reporting results for this population. ResultsIn total, 1194 RCTs involving 2,207,677 participants were included. Since 2000, the percentage of cardiovascular RCTs that exclude patients with CKD has increased from 66% to 79% (74% overall, 884 RCTs). In 73% of RCTs, more patients were excluded than anticipated on safety grounds (63% without dose adjustment necessary and 79% of RCTs with dose adjustment necessary). In total, 158 RCTs (13%) reported results patients with CKD separately (e.g. in subgroup analyses). Significant evidence gaps exist for most CVRM interventions for patients with CKD, particularly for those with CKD stage 4-5. For patients with an eGFR \u003c30 ml/min/1.73m2, 23 RCTs reported results, for dialysis patients 15 RCTs, and for kidney transplant patients only 1 RCT. ConclusionThe underrepresentation of patients with CKD in cardiovascular RCTs has not improved in the past two decades and three-quarters of RCTs excluded more patients than expected on safety grounds. A lack of RCTs that report results for patients with CKD has resulted in significant evidence gaps for most CVRM medications in all subgroups of patients with CKD, in particular for those with CKD stage 4-5.

C.; Samaan, J. S.; Yeo, Y. H.; Kunkel, D. C.; Habib, A. A.; Ghashghaei, R.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292780\nAmyloidosis is a rare, multisystem disease with several subtypes including AA (secondary), AL (amyloid light chain), and ATTR (transthyretin amyloidosis). In addition to variable symptoms and multidisciplinary management, amyloidosis being a rare disease further contributes to patients being at risk for decreased health literacy regarding their condition. Increased access to education materials containing simple, plain language may bridge literacy gaps and improve outcomes for patients with rare diseases such as amyloidosis. The large language model (LLM), Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), may be a powerful tool for improving the availability of accurate and easy to understand education materials. Amyloidosis-related questions from cardiology, gastroenterology, and neurology were sourced from esteemed medical societies and institutions along with amyloidosis Facebook support groups and inputted into ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Answers were graded on 4-point scale with both models responding to the majority of questions with either \"comprehensive\" or \"correct but inadequate\" answers with only 1 (1.2%) answer by GPT-3.5 graded as \"completely inaccurate\". When assessing reproducibility, GPT-3.5 scored reliably on more than 83.3% of responses, while GPT-4 produced above 98.2% consistent answers. Our findings show that ChatGPT can potentially serve as a supplemental tool in disseminating vital health education to patients living with amyloidosis.\nDeciphering the genetic architecture of atrial fibrillation offers insights into disease prediction, pathophysiology and downstream sequelae\nAuthors: Yuan, S.; Li, Y.; Wang, L.; XU, F.; Chen, J.; Levin, M.; Xiong, Y.; Voight, B. F.; Damrauer, S. M.; Gill, D.; Burgess, S.; Akesson, A.; Michaelsson, K.; Li, X.; Shen, X.; Larsson, S. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292938\nAims The study aimed to discover novel genetic loci for atrial fibrillation (AF), explore the shared genetic etiologies between AF and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic traits, and uncover AF pathogenesis using Mendelian randomization analysis. Methods and results We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 109,787 AF cases and 1,165,920 controls of European ancestry and identified 215 loci, among which 91 were novel. We performed Genomic Structural Equation Modeling analysis between AF and four cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and vneous thromboembolism) and found 189 loci shared across these diseases as well as a universal genetic locus shared by atherosclerotic outcomes (i.e., rs1537373 near CDKN2B). Three genetic loci (rs10740129 near JMJD1C, rs2370982 near NRXN3, and rs9931494 near FTO) were associated with AF and cardiometabolic traits. A polygenic risk score derived from this genome-wide meta-analysis was associated with AF risk (odds ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 2.31-2.41 per standard deviation increase) in the UK biobank. This score, combined with age, sex, and basic clinical features, predicted AF risk (AUC 0.784, 95% CI 0.781-0.787) in Europeans. Phenome-wide association analysis of the polygenic risk score identified many AF-related comorbidities of the circulatory, endocrine, and respiratory systems. Phenome-wide and multi-omic Mendelian randomization analyses identified associations of blood lipids and pressure, diabetes, insomnia, obesity, short sleep, and smoking, 27 blood proteins, one gut microbe (genus.Catenibacterium), and 11 blood metabolites with risk to AF. Conclusions This genome-wide association study and trans-omic Mendelian randomization analysis provides insights into disease risk prediction, pathophysiology and downstream sequelae.\nCommon- and rare-variant genetic architecture of heart failure across the allele frequency spectrum\nAuthors: Lee, D. S. M.; DePaolo, J. S.; Aragam, K. G.; Biddinger, K.; Conery, M.; Dilitikas, O.; Hoffman-Andrews, L.; Judy, R. L.; Khan, A.; Kulo, I.; Puckelwartz, M. J.; Reza, N.; Satterfield, B. A.; Singhal, P.; Regeneron Genetics Center, ; Arany, Z. P.; Cappola, T. P.; Carruth, E.; Day, S. M.; Do, R.; Haggarty, C. M.; Joseph, J.; McNally, E.; Nadkarni, G.; Owens, A. T.; Rader, D. J.; Ritchie, M. D.; Sun, Y.; Voight, B. F.; Levin, M. G.; Damrauer, S. M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292724\nHeart failure (HF) is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, that affects over 30 million individuals worldwide. Historically, the genetics of HF have been studied in Mendelian forms of disease, linking rare genetic variants to familial cardiomyopathies. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk of HF. However, the relative importance of genetic variants across the allele-frequency spectrum remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report the results of common- and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure, applying recently developed methods to quantify the heritability of HF attributable to different classes of genetic variation. We combine GWAS data across multi-ancestry populations including 207,346 individuals from HF and 2,151,210 without, identifying 176 risk loci at genome-wide significance (p \u003c 5x10-8). Signals at newly identified common-variant loci include coding variants in Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (MYBPC3, BAG3), as well as regulators of lipoprotein (LPL) and glucose metabolism (GIPR, GLP1R), and are enriched in cardiac, muscle, nerve, and vascular tissues, as well as myocyte and adipocyte cell types. Gene burden studies in the Penn Medicine BioBank uncover exome-wide significant (p \u003c 3.03x10-6) associations for HF and rare predicted loss-of-function variants in TTN and MYBPC3. Although the total burden heritability of rare coding variants in HF (3.5%, 95% CI 0.94-6.0%) is comparable to common variant heritability (4.3%, 95% CI 3.9-4.7%), burden heritability is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (30.4% explained by TTN, LMNA, FLNC, and MYBPC3), while common-variant heritability is more diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we demonstrate that common-variant background, in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS), significantly modifies the risk of HF among carriers of pathogenic truncating variants in the Mendelian cardiomyopathy gene TTN. These findings suggest a significant polygenic component to HF exists that is not captured by current clinical genetic testing.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWhile previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of PAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of PAT in a large population cohort.

MethodsA deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber magnetic resonance images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants.

ResultsA total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex ({beta} = &#43;0.76 SD in PAT), age (r = 0.15), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.55) (P &lt; 1x10-230). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure ({beta} = &#43;0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes ({beta} = &#43;0.56) than in coronary artery disease ({beta} = &#43;0.22) or AF ({beta} = &#43;0.18). PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per &#43;1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during a mean 3.2 ({&#43;/-}1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We identified 5 novel genetic loci for PAT and implicated transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1, EBF2 and CEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2 and TRIB2). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, heart failure, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per &#43;1 SD in PGS, P &lt; 2x10-10).

ConclusionsPAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal adiposity and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes and heart failure.

Clinical PerspectiveWhat is new? O_LIIn a large, prospective and uniformly phenotyped cohort, pericardial adipose tissue was independently predictive of incident heart failure and type 2 diabetes when adjusted for body mass index.
C_LIO_LIIn contrast, pericardial adipose tissue was not independently predictive of atrial fibrillation.
C_LIO_LIA genome-wide association study of pericardial adipose tissue identified five novel loci, implicating genes influencing adipocyte morphology, brown-like adipose tissue differentiation and abdominal adiposity.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications? O_LIPericardial adipose tissue accumulation may reflect a metabolically unhealthy adiposity phenotype similarly to abdominal visceral adiposity.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, but their systematic underrepresentation in cardiovascular randomised controlled trials (RCTs) limits appropriate evidence to guide cardiovascular risk management (CVRM). This systematic review aims to evaluate trends in the underrepresentation of patients with CKD in cardiovascular RCTs in the past 20 years and highlight evidence gaps for CVRM medications in this population.

MethodsA systematic search was conducted in ClinicalTrials.gov from its inception in 2000 until October 2021, targeting RCTs evaluating the efficacy of CVRM medications on mortality, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure in adults with cardiovascular disease or one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Two reviewers independently screened references and extracted data. Outcomes were the exclusion rate of patients with CKD over time and an evidence map of studies reporting results for this population.

ResultsIn total, 1194 RCTs involving 2,207,677 participants were included. Since 2000, the percentage of cardiovascular RCTs that exclude patients with CKD has increased from 66% to 79% (74% overall, 884 RCTs). In 73% of RCTs, more patients were excluded than anticipated on safety grounds (63% without dose adjustment necessary and 79% of RCTs with dose adjustment necessary). In total, 158 RCTs (13%) reported results patients with CKD separately (e.g. in subgroup analyses). Significant evidence gaps exist for most CVRM interventions for patients with CKD, particularly for those with CKD stage 4-5. For patients with an eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2, 23 RCTs reported results, for dialysis patients 15 RCTs, and for kidney transplant patients only 1 RCT.

ConclusionThe underrepresentation of patients with CKD in cardiovascular RCTs has not improved in the past two decades and three-quarters of RCTs excluded more patients than expected on safety grounds. A lack of RCTs that report results for patients with CKD has resulted in significant evidence gaps for most CVRM medications in all subgroups of patients with CKD, in particular for those with CKD stage 4-5.

        <p class="abstract">Amyloidosis is a rare, multisystem disease with several subtypes including AA (secondary), AL (amyloid light chain), and ATTR (transthyretin amyloidosis). In addition to variable symptoms and multidisciplinary management, amyloidosis being a rare disease further contributes to patients being at risk for decreased health literacy regarding their condition. Increased access to education materials containing simple, plain language may bridge literacy gaps and improve outcomes for patients with rare diseases such as amyloidosis. The large language model (LLM), Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), may be a powerful tool for improving the availability of accurate and easy to understand education materials. Amyloidosis-related questions from cardiology, gastroenterology, and neurology were sourced from esteemed medical societies and institutions along with amyloidosis Facebook support groups and inputted into ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Answers were graded on 4-point scale with both models responding to the majority of questions with either &#34;comprehensive&#34; or &#34;correct but inadequate&#34; answers with only 1 (1.2%) answer by GPT-3.5 graded as &#34;completely inaccurate&#34;. When assessing reproducibility, GPT-3.5 scored reliably on more than 83.3% of responses, while GPT-4 produced above 98.2% consistent answers. Our findings show that ChatGPT can potentially serve as a supplemental tool in disseminating vital health education to patients living with amyloidosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims The study aimed to discover novel genetic loci for atrial fibrillation (AF), explore the shared genetic etiologies between AF and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic traits, and uncover AF pathogenesis using Mendelian randomization analysis. Methods and results We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 109,787 AF cases and 1,165,920 controls of European ancestry and identified 215 loci, among which 91 were novel. We performed Genomic Structural Equation Modeling analysis between AF and four cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and vneous thromboembolism) and found 189 loci shared across these diseases as well as a universal genetic locus shared by atherosclerotic outcomes (i.e., rs1537373 near CDKN2B). Three genetic loci (rs10740129 near JMJD1C, rs2370982 near NRXN3, and rs9931494 near FTO) were associated with AF and cardiometabolic traits. A polygenic risk score derived from this genome-wide meta-analysis was associated with AF risk (odds ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 2.31-2.41 per standard deviation increase) in the UK biobank. This score, combined with age, sex, and basic clinical features, predicted AF risk (AUC 0.784, 95% CI 0.781-0.787) in Europeans. Phenome-wide association analysis of the polygenic risk score identified many AF-related comorbidities of the circulatory, endocrine, and respiratory systems. Phenome-wide and multi-omic Mendelian randomization analyses identified associations of blood lipids and pressure, diabetes, insomnia, obesity, short sleep, and smoking, 27 blood proteins, one gut microbe (genus.Catenibacterium), and 11 blood metabolites with risk to AF. Conclusions This genome-wide association study and trans-omic Mendelian randomization analysis provides insights into disease risk prediction, pathophysiology and downstream sequelae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart failure (HF) is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, that affects over 30 million individuals worldwide. Historically, the genetics of HF have been studied in Mendelian forms of disease, linking rare genetic variants to familial cardiomyopathies. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk of HF. However, the relative importance of genetic variants across the allele-frequency spectrum remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report the results of common- and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure, applying recently developed methods to quantify the heritability of HF attributable to different classes of genetic variation. We combine GWAS data across multi-ancestry populations including 207,346 individuals from HF and 2,151,210 without, identifying 176 risk loci at genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5x10-8). Signals at newly identified common-variant loci include coding variants in Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (MYBPC3, BAG3), as well as regulators of lipoprotein (LPL) and glucose metabolism (GIPR, GLP1R), and are enriched in cardiac, muscle, nerve, and vascular tissues, as well as myocyte and adipocyte cell types. Gene burden studies in the Penn Medicine BioBank uncover exome-wide significant (p &lt; 3.03x10-6) associations for HF and rare predicted loss-of-function variants in TTN and MYBPC3. Although the total burden heritability of rare coding variants in HF (3.5%, 95% CI 0.94-6.0%) is comparable to common variant heritability (4.3%, 95% CI 3.9-4.7%), burden heritability is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (30.4% explained by TTN, LMNA, FLNC, and MYBPC3), while common-variant heritability is more diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we demonstrate that common-variant background, in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS), significantly modifies the risk of HF among carriers of pathogenic truncating variants in the Mendelian cardiomyopathy gene TTN. These findings suggest a significant polygenic component to HF exists that is not captured by current clinical genetic testing.</p>
