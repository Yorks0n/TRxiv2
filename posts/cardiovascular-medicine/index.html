Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.\nDrug target Mendelian randomization supports apolipoprotein C3-lowering for lipoprotein-lipid levels reductions and cardiovascular diseases prevention\nAuthors: Gagnon, E.; Arsenault, B. J.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.23298088\nBackground and aims: Inhibitors of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC3) are currently approved for the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome. We used drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effect of genetically predicted decrease in APOC3 blood protein levels on cardiometabolic traits and diseases. Methods: We quantified lifelong reductions in APOC3 blood levels by selecting all genome wide significant and independent (r2\u003c0.1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOC3 gene region +/-1Mb, from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of apoC3 blood protein levels (deCODE, n = 35,378, Fenland, n = 10,708 and ARIC, n = 7,213). We included the largest GWASes on 18 cardiometabolica traits and 9 cardiometabolic diseases as study outcomes. Results: A one standard deviation lowering in apoC3 blood protein levels was associated with lower triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and glomerular filtration rate as well as higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. APOC3 lowering was also associated with lower risk of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91 95% CI=0.82 to 1.00), aortic stenosis (OR = 0.82 95% CI=0.73 to 0.93), and coronary artery disease (OR = 0.86 95% CI=0.80 to 0.93), and was associated with increased parental lifespan (0.06 95% CI=0.03 to 0.09 years). These results were concordant across robust MR methods, the three protein datasets and upon adjustment for APOA1, APOA4 and APOA5 using a multivariable MR framework. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that apoC3 lowering could result in widespread benefits for cardiometabolic health and encourage the launch of trials on apoC3 inhibition for coronary artery disease prevention.\nSex-specific cardiovascular risk factors in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: St Pierre, S. R.; Kaczmarski, B. K.; Peirlinck, M.; Kuhl, E.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297622\nThe lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individuals risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors as well as tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score, and quantify the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. Strikingly, for first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that, out of the top 10 features across three sex and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40-50%, electrocardiogram 30-33%, pulse wave analysis 13-23%, and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound 0-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

K.; Lau, Y. M.; Lui, H. W.; Chan, W.-F.; San, W.-C.; ZHOU, M.; CHENG, Y.-y.; Huang, D.; Lai, W.-H.; Lau, Y.-M.; Siu, C.-W.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297947\nBackgroundArtificial intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic algorithms can achieve cardiologist-level accuracy, but their clinical use is limited as they cannot be installed in older ECG machines. ObjectiveTo develop a smartphone application that extracts and analyzes ECG waveforms from photos using machine learning techniques. MethodsA smartphone application was developed to automatically extract ECG waveforms from photos taken by clinicians using computer vision and machine learning. Custom designed machine learning models were developed to perform waveform identification, gridline removal, and scale calibration. The extracted voltage-time series waveforms were analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning-based diagnostic algorithms, and the accuracy of the proof-of-concept application was assessed. ResultsWaveforms from 40,516 scanned and 444 photographed ECGs were automatically extracted. 12,828 of 13,258 (96.8%) scanned and 5,399 of 5,743 (94.0%) photographed waveforms were correctly cropped and labelled. 11,604 of 12,735 (91.1%) scanned and 5,062 of 5,752 (88.0%) photographed waveforms achieved successful voltage-time signal extraction after automatic gridline and background noise removal. The AF diagnostic algorithm achieved 91.3% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity, 95.6% positive predictive value, 88.6% negative predictive value and 93.4% F1 score. ConclusionUsing computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect cardiac conditions from photos of ECGs taken with smartphones is feasible. This platform can enable widespread deployment of the latest machine learning-based ECG diagnostic algorithms.\nDynamic Importance of Genomic and Clinical Risk for Coronary Artery Disease Over the Life Course\nAuthors: Urbut, S. M.; Cho, S. M. J.; Paruchuri, K.; Truong, B.; HAIDERMOTA, S.; Peloso, G. M.; Hornsby, W.; Philippakis, A.; Fahed, A. C.; Natarajan, P.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298055\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSEarlier identification of high coronary artery disease (CAD) risk individuals may enable more effective prevention strategies. However, existing 10-year risk frameworks are ineffective at earlier identification. Understanding the variable importance of genomic and clinical factors across life stages may significantly improve lifelong CAD event prediction. ObjectiveTo assess the time-varying significance of genomic and clinical risk factors in CAD risk estimation across various age groups. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA longitudinal study was performed using data from two cohort studies: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) with 3,588 participants aged 19-57 years and the UK Biobank (UKB) with 327,837 participants aged 40-70 years. A total of 134,765 and 3,831,734 person-time years were observed in FOS and UKB, respectively. Main Outcomes and MeasuresHazard ratios (HR) for CAD were calculated for polygenic risk scores (PRS) and clinical risk factors at each age of enrollment. The relative importance of PRS and Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) in predicting CAD events was also evaluated by age groups. ResultsThe importance of CAD PRS diminished over the life course, with an HR of 3.58 (95% CI 1.39-9.19) at age 19 in FOS and an HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.48-1.54) by age 70 in UKB. Clinical risk factors exhibited similar age-dependent trends. PRS significantly outperformed PCE in identifying subsequent CAD events in the 40-45-year age group, with 3.2-fold more appropriately identified events. The mean age of CAD events occurred 1.8 years earlier for those at high genomic risk but 9.6 years later for those at high clinical risk (p\u003c0.001). Overall, adding PRS improved the area under the receiving operating curve of the PCE by an average of +5.1% (95% CI 4.9-5.2%) across all age groups; among individuals \u003c55 years, PRS augmented the AUC-ROC of the PCE by 6.5% (95% CI 5.5-7.5%, p\u003c0.001). Conclusions and RelevanceGenomic and clinical risk factors for CAD display time-varying importance across the lifespan. The study underscores the added value of CAD PRS, particularly among individuals younger than 55 years, for enhancing early risk prediction and prevention strategies. Key Points QuestionHow do genomic and clinical risk factors contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk across a broad age range? FindingsThis longitudinal observational study across two cohorts found that both genomic and clinical risk factors exhibit age-dependent significance for CAD risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are most informative for individuals younger than 55 years, improving the predictive accuracy of current risk equations for these individuals. MeaningThe study emphasizes the need to incorporate the dynamic effects of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly genomic risk, for more accurate early-life risk prediction and efficient CAD prevention strategies.\nVentricular volume asymmetry as a novel imaging biomarker for disease discrimination and outcome prediction\nAuthors: McCracken, C.; Szabo, L.; Abdulelah, Z. A.; Vago, H.; Nichols, T.; Petersen, S. E.; Neubauer, S.; Raisi-Estabragh, Z.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298024\nBackgroundThe utility of ventricular asymmetry as an imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk has not been assessed in population cohorts. ObjectivesThis study presents a comprehensive assessment of the population distribution of ventricular asymmetry and its relationships across a range of prevalent and incident cardiorespiratory diseases. MethodsCardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging metrics derived from automated image analysis were examined, along with clinical outcomes ascertained through linked health records. Ventricular asymmetry was expressed as the ratio of left and right ventricular (LV, RV) end-diastolic volumes. The normal range for ventricular symmetry was defined in a healthy subset without cardiorespiratory disease. Participants with values outside the 5th-95th percentiles of the healthy distribution were classed as either LV dominant (LV/RV \u003e 112%) or RV dominant (LV/RV \u003c 80%) asymmetry. Associations of LV and RV dominant asymmetry with vascular risk factors, CMR features, and prevalent and incident cardiovascular diseases were examined using regression models, adjusting for vascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and conventional CMR measures. ResultsThe analysis includes 44,796 participants (average age 64.1{+/-}7.7 years; 51.9% women). Ventricular asymmetry, in either direction, was associated with older age and adverse cardiovascular remodeling. LV-dominance was linked to an array of pre-existing vascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases, and a two-fold increased risk of incident heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality. ConclusionsVentricular asymmetry has clinical utility for cardiovascular risk assessment, providing information that is incremental to traditional risk factors and conventional CMR metrics. Condensed abstractHealthy hearts have a predictable symmetry. Asymmetry produced when one, e.g. the left ventricular (LV) volume outweighs the right, or vice versa, could be an important indicator of underlying disorders, and powerful risk indicator for future disease. In this study of 44,796 UK Biobank participants, we show that LV dominance associates significantly with clinical risk factors, existing heart disease, and a two-fold increased risk for future heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Ventricular asymmetry is easily calculated from conventional imaging metrics and could be a highly useful addition to the clinicians toolkit.

        <p class="abstract">Metabolomic platforms using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can now rapidly quantify many circulating metabolites which are potential biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aims: Inhibitors of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC3) are currently approved for the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome. We used drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effect of genetically predicted decrease in APOC3 blood protein levels on cardiometabolic traits and diseases. Methods: We quantified lifelong reductions in APOC3 blood levels by selecting all genome wide significant and independent (r2&lt;0.1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOC3 gene region &#43;/-1Mb, from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of apoC3 blood protein levels (deCODE, n = 35,378, Fenland, n = 10,708 and ARIC, n = 7,213). We included the largest GWASes on 18 cardiometabolica traits and 9 cardiometabolic diseases as study outcomes. Results: A one standard deviation lowering in apoC3 blood protein levels was associated with lower triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and glomerular filtration rate as well as higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. APOC3 lowering was also associated with lower risk of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91 95% CI=0.82 to 1.00), aortic stenosis (OR = 0.82 95% CI=0.73 to 0.93), and coronary artery disease (OR = 0.86 95% CI=0.80 to 0.93), and was associated with increased parental lifespan (0.06 95% CI=0.03 to 0.09 years). These results were concordant across robust MR methods, the three protein datasets and upon adjustment for APOA1, APOA4 and APOA5 using a multivariable MR framework. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that apoC3 lowering could result in widespread benefits for cardiometabolic health and encourage the launch of trials on apoC3 inhibition for coronary artery disease prevention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individuals risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors as well as tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score, and quantify the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. Strikingly, for first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that, out of the top 10 features across three sex and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40-50%, electrocardiogram 30-33%, pulse wave analysis 13-23%, and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound 0-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundArtificial intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic algorithms can achieve cardiologist-level accuracy, but their clinical use is limited as they cannot be installed in older ECG machines.

ObjectiveTo develop a smartphone application that extracts and analyzes ECG waveforms from photos using machine learning techniques.

MethodsA smartphone application was developed to automatically extract ECG waveforms from photos taken by clinicians using computer vision and machine learning. Custom designed machine learning models were developed to perform waveform identification, gridline removal, and scale calibration. The extracted voltage-time series waveforms were analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning-based diagnostic algorithms, and the accuracy of the proof-of-concept application was assessed.

ResultsWaveforms from 40,516 scanned and 444 photographed ECGs were automatically extracted. 12,828 of 13,258 (96.8%) scanned and 5,399 of 5,743 (94.0%) photographed waveforms were correctly cropped and labelled. 11,604 of 12,735 (91.1%) scanned and 5,062 of 5,752 (88.0%) photographed waveforms achieved successful voltage-time signal extraction after automatic gridline and background noise removal. The AF diagnostic algorithm achieved 91.3% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity, 95.6% positive predictive value, 88.6% negative predictive value and 93.4% F1 score.

ConclusionUsing computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect cardiac conditions from photos of ECGs taken with smartphones is feasible. This platform can enable widespread deployment of the latest machine learning-based ECG diagnostic algorithms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSEarlier identification of high coronary artery disease (CAD) risk individuals may enable more effective prevention strategies. However, existing 10-year risk frameworks are ineffective at earlier identification. Understanding the variable importance of genomic and clinical factors across life stages may significantly improve lifelong CAD event prediction.

ObjectiveTo assess the time-varying significance of genomic and clinical risk factors in CAD risk estimation across various age groups.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA longitudinal study was performed using data from two cohort studies: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) with 3,588 participants aged 19-57 years and the UK Biobank (UKB) with 327,837 participants aged 40-70 years. A total of 134,765 and 3,831,734 person-time years were observed in FOS and UKB, respectively.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresHazard ratios (HR) for CAD were calculated for polygenic risk scores (PRS) and clinical risk factors at each age of enrollment. The relative importance of PRS and Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) in predicting CAD events was also evaluated by age groups.

ResultsThe importance of CAD PRS diminished over the life course, with an HR of 3.58 (95% CI 1.39-9.19) at age 19 in FOS and an HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.48-1.54) by age 70 in UKB. Clinical risk factors exhibited similar age-dependent trends. PRS significantly outperformed PCE in identifying subsequent CAD events in the 40-45-year age group, with 3.2-fold more appropriately identified events. The mean age of CAD events occurred 1.8 years earlier for those at high genomic risk but 9.6 years later for those at high clinical risk (p&lt;0.001). Overall, adding PRS improved the area under the receiving operating curve of the PCE by an average of &#43;5.1% (95% CI 4.9-5.2%) across all age groups; among individuals &lt;55 years, PRS augmented the AUC-ROC of the PCE by 6.5% (95% CI 5.5-7.5%, p&lt;0.001).

Conclusions and RelevanceGenomic and clinical risk factors for CAD display time-varying importance across the lifespan. The study underscores the added value of CAD PRS, particularly among individuals younger than 55 years, for enhancing early risk prediction and prevention strategies.

Key Points QuestionHow do genomic and clinical risk factors contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk across a broad age range?

FindingsThis longitudinal observational study across two cohorts found that both genomic and clinical risk factors exhibit age-dependent significance for CAD risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are most informative for individuals younger than 55 years, improving the predictive accuracy of current risk equations for these individuals.

MeaningThe study emphasizes the need to incorporate the dynamic effects of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly genomic risk, for more accurate early-life risk prediction and efficient CAD prevention strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe utility of ventricular asymmetry as an imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk has not been assessed in population cohorts.

ObjectivesThis study presents a comprehensive assessment of the population distribution of ventricular asymmetry and its relationships across a range of prevalent and incident cardiorespiratory diseases.

MethodsCardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging metrics derived from automated image analysis were examined, along with clinical outcomes ascertained through linked health records. Ventricular asymmetry was expressed as the ratio of left and right ventricular (LV, RV) end-diastolic volumes. The normal range for ventricular symmetry was defined in a healthy subset without cardiorespiratory disease. Participants with values outside the 5th-95th percentiles of the healthy distribution were classed as either LV dominant (LV/RV &gt; 112%) or RV dominant (LV/RV &lt; 80%) asymmetry. Associations of LV and RV dominant asymmetry with vascular risk factors, CMR features, and prevalent and incident cardiovascular diseases were examined using regression models, adjusting for vascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and conventional CMR measures.

ResultsThe analysis includes 44,796 participants (average age 64.1{&#43;/-}7.7 years; 51.9% women). Ventricular asymmetry, in either direction, was associated with older age and adverse cardiovascular remodeling. LV-dominance was linked to an array of pre-existing vascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases, and a two-fold increased risk of incident heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality.

ConclusionsVentricular asymmetry has clinical utility for cardiovascular risk assessment, providing information that is incremental to traditional risk factors and conventional CMR metrics.

Condensed abstractHealthy hearts have a predictable symmetry. Asymmetry produced when one, e.g. the left ventricular (LV) volume outweighs the right, or vice versa, could be an important indicator of underlying disorders, and powerful risk indicator for future disease. In this study of 44,796 UK Biobank participants, we show that LV dominance associates significantly with clinical risk factors, existing heart disease, and a two-fold increased risk for future heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Ventricular asymmetry is easily calculated from conventional imaging metrics and could be a highly useful addition to the clinicians toolkit.
