We aimed to identify novel plasma metabolites and proteins associating with cardiac disease. MethodsMendelian randomisation (MR) was used to assess the association of 174 metabolites measured in up to 86,507 participants with AF, HF, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Subsequently, we sourced data on 1,567 plasma proteins and performed cis MR to identify proteins affecting the identified metabolites as well as the cardiac diseases. Proteins were prioritised on cardiac expression and druggability, and mapped to biological pathways. ResultsWe identified 35 metabolites associating with cardiac disease. AF was affected by seventeen metabolites, HF by nineteen, DCM by four, and NCIM by taurine. HF was particularly enriched for phosphatidylcholines (p=0.029) and DCM for acylcarnitines (p=0.001). Metabolite involvement in AF was more uniform, spanning for example phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines. We identified 38 druggable proteins expressed in cardiac tissue, with a directionally concordant effect on metabolites and cardiac disease. We recapitulated known associations, for example between the drug target of digoxin (AT1B2), taurine and NICM risk. Additionally, we identified numerous novel findings, such as higher RET values associating with phosphatidylcholines and decreasing AF and HF, and RET is targeted by drugs such as regorafenib which has known cardiotoxic side-effects. Pathway analysis implicated involvement of GDF15 signalling through RET, and ghrelin regulation of energy homeostasis in cardiac pathogenesis. ConclusionThis study identified 35 plasma metabolites involved with cardiac diseases and linked these to 38 druggable proteins, providing actionable leads for drug development.\nDerivation and validation of a non-invasive optoacoustic imaging biomarker for patients with intermittent claudication\nAuthors: Caranovic, M.; Kempf, J.; Li, Y.; Regensburger, A.

ObjectivesThe authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of MSOT to distinguish between healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with intermittent claudication (IC) by assessing hemoglobin-related biomarkers in calf muscle tissue. MethodsIn this monocentric, cross-sectional diagnostic trial using derivation (DC) and validation cohorts (VC) yll subjects underwent standardized PAD diagnostics. This included pulse palpation, ankle brachial index (ABI), duplex sonography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and assessment of health-related quality of life (VASCUQOL-6). The vascular occlusion profile in IC patients was confirmed by angiography (aggregated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, aTASC). MSOT imaging of calf muscle was performed before and after standardized heel raise provocation. ParticipantsOf 123 screened individuals, 102 completed the study. MSOT-derived oxygenation (msO2) after the exercise differentiated IC and HV with an area under curve the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) in DC by 0.99 (95%CI 0.97;1.00, p\u003c0.001, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95.8%) and in the VC by 0.95 (95%CI 0.95;1.00, p\u003c0.001, sensitivity: 96.2%, specificity: 96.0%). mSO2 positively correlated with the ABI post-exercise (R=0.83, 95%CI 0.75;0.88, P\u003c0.001), the absolute walking distance in the 6MWT (R=0.77, 95%CI 0.68;0.84, P\u003c0.001), the VASCUQOL-6 (R=0.79, 95%CI 0.70;0.85, P\u003c0.001) and negatively with aTASC classification (R=-0.80, 95%CI -0.86;-0.72, P\u003c0.001). ConclusionsPost-exercise MSOT-derived saturation in the calf muscle was validated as a new and promising diagnostic biomarker to distinguish between HV and IC patients yielding high sensitivity and specificity.

Using myocardial characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study aimed to detect early myocardial alterations, to analyze temporal changes with plasma cell therapy, and to predict risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in AL amyloidosis. Methods and ResultsParticipants with recently diagnosed AL amyloidosis were prospectively enrolled. Presence of AL cardiomyopathy (AL-CMP vs. AL-non-CMP) was determined by abnormal cardiac biomarkers. MRI was performed at baseline and 6 months, with 12-month imaging in AL-CMP cohort. MACE was defined as all-cause death, heart failure hospitalization, or cardiac transplantation. Mayo AL stage was based on troponin T, NT-proBNP, and difference in free light chains. The study cohort included 80 participants (median age 62 years, 58% males). Median left ventricular extracellular volume (ECV) was significantly higher in AL-CMP (53% vs. 30%, p\u003c0.001). ECV was abnormal (\u003e32%) in all AL-CMP and in 47% of AL-non-CMP. ECV tended to increase at 6 months and decreased significantly from 6 to 12 months in AL-CMP (median -3%, p=0.011). ECV was strongly associated with MACE (p\u003c0.001), and improved MACE prediction when added to Mayo AL stage (p=0.002). ECV[\u0026le;]32% identified a cohort without MACE, while ECV\u003e48% identified a cohort with 74% MACE. ConclusionsIn AL amyloidosis, ECV detects subclinical cardiomyopathy. ECV tends to increase from baseline to 6 months and decreases significantly from 6 and 12 months of plasma cell therapy in AL-CMP. ECV provides excellent risk stratification and offers additional prognostic performance over Mayo AL stage.\n",

This included pulse palpation, ankle brachial index (ABI), duplex sonography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and assessment of health-related quality of life (VASCUQOL-6). The vascular occlusion profile in IC patients was confirmed by angiography (aggregated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, aTASC). MSOT imaging of calf muscle was performed before and after standardized heel raise provocation.

ParticipantsOf 123 screened individuals, 102 completed the study. MSOT-derived oxygenation (msO2) after the exercise differentiated IC and HV with an area under curve the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) in DC by 0.99 (95%CI 0.97;1.00, p&lt;0.001, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95.8%) and in the VC by 0.95 (95%CI 0.95;1.00, p&lt;0.001, sensitivity: 96.2%, specificity: 96.0%). mSO2 positively correlated with the ABI post-exercise (R=0.83, 95%CI 0.75;0.88, P&lt;0.001), the absolute walking distance in the 6MWT (R=0.77, 95%CI 0.68;0.84, P&lt;0.001), the VASCUQOL-6 (R=0.79, 95%CI 0.70;0.85, P&lt;0.001) and negatively with aTASC classification (R=-0.80, 95%CI -0.86;-0.72, P&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsPost-exercise MSOT-derived saturation in the calf muscle was validated as a new and promising diagnostic biomarker to distinguish between HV and IC patients yielding high sensitivity and specificity. (NCT05373927)</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractO_ST_ABSAimsC_ST_ABSIn systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, cardiac involvement portends poor prognosis. Using myocardial characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study aimed to detect early myocardial alterations, to analyze temporal changes with plasma cell therapy, and to predict risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in AL amyloidosis.

Methods and ResultsParticipants with recently diagnosed AL amyloidosis were prospectively enrolled. Presence of AL cardiomyopathy (AL-CMP vs. AL-non-CMP) was determined by abnormal cardiac biomarkers. MRI was performed at baseline and 6 months, with 12-month imaging in AL-CMP cohort. MACE was defined as all-cause death, heart failure hospitalization, or cardiac transplantation. Mayo AL stage was based on troponin T, NT-proBNP, and difference in free light chains. The study cohort included 80 participants (median age 62 years, 58% males). Median left ventricular extracellular volume (ECV) was significantly higher in AL-CMP (53% vs. 30%, p&lt;0.001). ECV was abnormal (&gt;32%) in all AL-CMP and in 47% of AL-non-CMP. ECV tended to increase at 6 months and decreased significantly from 6 to 12 months in AL-CMP (median -3%, p=0.011). ECV was strongly associated with MACE (p&lt;0.001), and improved MACE prediction when added to Mayo AL stage (p=0.002). ECV[&amp;le;]32% identified a cohort without MACE, while ECV&gt;48% identified a cohort with 74% MACE.

ConclusionsIn AL amyloidosis, ECV detects subclinical cardiomyopathy. ECV tends to increase from baseline to 6 months and decreases significantly from 6 and 12 months of plasma cell therapy in AL-CMP. ECV provides excellent risk stratification and offers additional prognostic performance over Mayo AL stage.</p>
