Early detection through cardiotoxicity screening by biomarker monitoring can lead to prompt intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we investigate the association between cardiotoxicity screening with routine serial troponin I monitoring in asymptomatic patients receiving ICI, cardiovascular adverse event (CV AE) detection, and overall survival (OS). MethodsWe instituted a standardized troponin I screening protocol at baseline and with each ICI dose (every 2-4 weeks) in all patients receiving ICI at our center starting Jan 2019. We subsequently collected data in 825 patients receiving ICI at our institution from January 2018 to October 2021. Of these patients, 428 underwent cardiotoxicity screening with serial troponin I monitoring during ICI administration (Jan 2019-Oct 2021) and 397 patients were unmonitored (Jan 2018-Dec 2018). We followed patients for nine months following their first dose of ICI and compared outcomes of CV AEs and OS between monitored and unmonitored patients. Additionally, we investigated rates of CV AEs, all-cause mortality, and oncologic time-to-treatment failure (TTF) between patients with an elevated troponin I value during the monitoring period versus patients without elevated troponin I. ResultsWe found a lower rate of severe (grades 4-5) CV AEs, resulting in critical illness or death, in patients who underwent troponin monitoring (0.5%) compared to patients who did not undergo monitoring (1.8%), (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.79, p = 0.04). There was no difference in overall CV AEs (grades 3-5) or OS between monitored and unmonitored patients. In the entire cohort, patients with at least one elevated troponin I during the follow up period, during routine monitoring or unmonitored, had a higher risk of overall CV AEs (HR 10.96, 95% CI 4.65-25.85, p\u003c0.001) as well as overall mortality (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.69 - 4.10, p\u003c0.001) compared to those without elevated troponin. Oncologic time-to-treatment failure (TTF) was not significantly different in a sub-cohort of monitored vs. unmonitored patients. ConclusionsPatients undergoing cardiotoxicity screening with troponin I monitoring during ICI therapy had a lower rate of severe (grade 4-5) CV AEs compared patients who were not screened. Troponin I elevation in screened and unscreened patients was significantly associated with increased CV AEs as well as increased mortality. Troponin I monitoring did not impact oncologic time-to-treatment-failure in a sub-cohort analysis of patients treated with ICI. These results provide preliminary evidence for clinical utility of cardiotoxicity screening with troponin I monitoring in patients receiving ICI therapy.\nLongitudinal Association of Mid-Life Ten Year Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score with Brain Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease, Neurodegeneration and White Matter Hyper Intensities in Cognitively Unimpaired Older Adults: Heart SCORE Brain Study\nAuthors: Saeed, A.; Chang, Y.; Swanson, J.; Vu, M.; Mapstone, M.; Villemagne, V. L.; Snitz, B.; Royse, S. K.; Lopresti, B.; Aizenstein, H.; Wu, M.; Kip, K. E.; Reis, S. E.; Lopez, O.; Cohen, A. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301752\nIntroduction: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors in mid-life have been associated with cognitive decline and late-life dementia. However, the role of these risk factors in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology remains elusive. We investigated whether mid-life 10-year pooled cohort equations (PCE) based ASCVD risk is associated with late-life amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [AT(N)] measures and white matter hyperintensities (WMHI). Methods: Participants enrolled in the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study between 2003-2005 (mid-life) and underwent brain MRI and PET scans in 2018-2022 (age \u003e65 years, late-life) to detect and quantify amyloid (A, PiB-PET) and tau (T, Flortaucipir (FTP) PET) deposition, cortical thickness (N) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs). Mid-life PCE ASCVD risk was categorized as; borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%- \u003c15%), or high ([\u0026ge;]15%). Association of midlife ASCVD risk HR (5% CI) was assessed using logistic and linear regressions with A, T, or N and chi square beta coefficients for WMHI in latelife. Results: Over a ~16y follow up, in 135 participants (mean age 73y), A and T showed no significant association with mid-life ASCVD risk. Neurodegeneration had a graded association with mid-life ASCVD risk categories (ORASCVD high vs low risk% 6.98 [2.44-19.95]; p\u003c0.05) driven by self-identified Black race and age. In a subset n=60, ASCVD risk score was also associated with WMHIs (({beta}=0.42 plusmn; 0.22; p=0.05) in a model adjusted for inflammation and education. Conclusions: In this asymptomatic, diverse cohort, 10y ASCVD risk was predictive of late-life neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities but not amyloid or tau. These data suggest that ASCVD risk factors in midlife may lead to a state of vulnerability (through increased neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities) which may progress to cognitive decline and dementia. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.\nFamilial risk of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive and obstructive coronary arteries -A nation-wide cohort study\nAuthors: Hakansson, F. H.; Svensson, P.; Järnbert-Petterson, H.; Ehrenborg, E.; Spaak, J.; Nordenskjöld, A. M.; Eggers, K. M.; Tornvall, P.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301968\nBackground: The familial risk among patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is unknown. Previous studies of family history in myocardial infarction (MI), have not made a distinction between MINOCA and MI due to coronary artery disease (MI-CAD), based on angiographic findings. Objectives: To investigate familial risk of MI without and with obstructive coronary arteries. Methods: A register-based cohort study with a total of 15,462 MINOCA cases, 204,424 MI-CAD cases, 38,220 control subjects without MI and with non-obstructive coronary arteries. First-degree relatives were identified 1995-2020. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to compare familial risk in MINOCA and MI-CAD with control subjects. Results: During a mean follow-up of 8.1 {+/-} 4.2 years, MINOCA occurred in 1.0% of first-degree relatives with MINOCA whereas MI-CAD occurred in 9.7% of first-degree relatives of MINOCA. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for a MINOCA-relative experiencing MINOCA and MI-CAD, compared to control subjects, was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-1.23) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.03-1.18), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 8.5 {+/-}4.8 years, MI-CAD occurred in 12.2% of first- degree relatives with MI-CAD with age- and sex-adjusted HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.37-1.49). Conclusions: No increased familial risk of MINOCA was observed for MINOCA-patients whereas there was an increased familial risk for MI-CAD when compared to control subjects. These results may indicate that genetic factors and shared environmental factors within a family leading to CAD are important also for MINOCA, thus MI-CAD and MINOCA could share underlying mechanisms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors in mid-life have been associated with cognitive decline and late-life dementia. However, the role of these risk factors in preclinical Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) pathophysiology remains elusive. We investigated whether mid-life 10-year pooled cohort equations (PCE) based ASCVD risk is associated with late-life amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [AT(N)] measures and white matter hyperintensities (WMHI). Methods: Participants enrolled in the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study between 2003-2005 (mid-life) and underwent brain MRI and PET scans in 2018-2022 (age &gt;65 years, late-life) to detect and quantify amyloid (A, PiB-PET) and tau (T, Flortaucipir (FTP) PET) deposition, cortical thickness (N) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs). Mid-life PCE ASCVD risk was categorized as; borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%- &lt;15%), or high ([&amp;ge;]15%). Association of midlife ASCVD risk HR (5% CI) was assessed using logistic and linear regressions with A, T, or N and chi square beta coefficients for WMHI in latelife. Results: Over a ~16y follow up, in 135 participants (mean age 73y), A and T showed no significant association with mid-life ASCVD risk. Neurodegeneration had a graded association with mid-life ASCVD risk categories (ORASCVD high vs low risk% 6.98 [2.44-19.95]; p&lt;0.05) driven by self-identified Black race and age. In a subset n=60, ASCVD risk score was also associated with WMHIs (({beta}=0.42 plusmn; 0.22; p=0.05) in a model adjusted for inflammation and education. Conclusions: In this asymptomatic, diverse cohort, 10y ASCVD risk was predictive of late-life neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities but not amyloid or tau. These data suggest that ASCVD risk factors in midlife may lead to a state of vulnerability (through increased neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities) which may progress to cognitive decline and dementia. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The familial risk among patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is unknown. Previous studies of family history in myocardial infarction (MI), have not made a distinction between MINOCA and MI due to coronary artery disease (MI-CAD), based on angiographic findings. Objectives: To investigate familial risk of MI without and with obstructive coronary arteries. Methods: A register-based cohort study with a total of 15,462 MINOCA cases, 204,424 MI-CAD cases, 38,220 control subjects without MI and with non-obstructive coronary arteries. First-degree relatives were identified 1995-2020. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to compare familial risk in MINOCA and MI-CAD with control subjects. Results: During a mean follow-up of 8.1 {&#43;/-} 4.2 years, MINOCA occurred in 1.0% of first-degree relatives with MINOCA whereas MI-CAD occurred in 9.7% of first-degree relatives of MINOCA. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for a MINOCA-relative experiencing MINOCA and MI-CAD, compared to control subjects, was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-1.23) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.03-1.18), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 8.5 {&#43;/-}4.8 years, MI-CAD occurred in 12.2% of first- degree relatives with MI-CAD with age- and sex-adjusted HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.37-1.49). Conclusions: No increased familial risk of MINOCA was observed for MINOCA-patients whereas there was an increased familial risk for MI-CAD when compared to control subjects. These results may indicate that genetic factors and shared environmental factors within a family leading to CAD are important also for MINOCA, thus MI-CAD and MINOCA could share underlying mechanisms.</p>
