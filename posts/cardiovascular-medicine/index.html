Emerging studies further suggest an associated risk of myocarditis following administration of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccinations. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. We investigated the incidence of myocarditis throughout the COVID-19 pandemic across a large healthcare system in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. MethodsThis retrospective analysis of patients admitted from 2017-2022. Myocarditis cases were temporally divided into two cohorts based on year of admission (pre-pandemic 2017-2019; pandemic 2020-2022), which were compared for overall myocarditis incidence. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. ResultsThe cohort included 573 myocarditis patients (pre-pandemic=208, pandemic=365). From 2017-2019, the total number and rate of myocarditis cases was consistent. Overall cases of myocarditis increased during the pandemic (97, 126, 142 patients in 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively). Interestingly, the rate of myocarditis cases not related to COVID-19 or the vaccines stayed consistent (0.0674%, 0.0676%, 0.0807%), but the rate of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or the vaccines myocarditis increased each year (0.0210%, 0.0416%, 0.0480%). In-hospital mortality was similar between the two pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts (5.35% versus 7.7%, 0.276). ConclusionAmong hospitalized patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of myocarditis increased as compared to the pre-pandemic era. It appears this increase is associated with either the SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. In-hospital outcomes did not differ during the pandemic, but ongoing research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of myocarditis during the pandemic.\nCarriers of rare damaging CCR2 genetic variants are at lower risk of atherosclerotic disease\nAuthors: Georgakis, M. K.; Malik, R.; Hasbani, N. R.; Shakt, G.; Morrison, A.; Tsao, N. L.; Judy, R.; Mitchell, B. D.; Xu, H.; Montasser, M. E.; Do, R.; Kenny, E.; Loos, R. J. F.; Terry, J. G.; Carr, J. J.; Bis, J. C.; Psaty, B. M.; Longstreth, W. T.; Young, K.; Lutz, S. M.; Cho, M.; Broome, J.; Khan, A. T.; Wang, F. F.; Heard-Costa, N.; Seshadri, S.; Ramachandran, V.; Palmer, N. D.; Freedman, B. I.; Bowden, D. W.; Yanek, L. R.; Kral, B. G.; Becker, L. C.; Peyser, P. A.; Bielak, L. F.; Ammous, F.; Carson, A. P.; Hall, M. E.; Raffield, L. M.; Rich, S.; Post, W.; Tracy, R.; Taylor, K.; Guo, X.; Mahaney, Score: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294063\nBackgroundThe CCL2/CCR2 axis governs monocyte trafficking and recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions. Human genetic analyses and population-based studies support an association between circulating CCL2 levels and atherosclerosis. Still, it remains unknown whether pharmacological targeting of CCR2, the main CCL2 receptor, would provide protection against human atherosclerotic disease. MethodsIn whole-exome sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants (40-69 years), we identified predicted loss-of-function (LoF) or damaging missense (REVEL score \u003e0.5) variants within the CCR2 gene. We prioritized variants associated with lower monocyte count (p\u003c0.05) and tested associations with vascular risk factors and risk of atherosclerotic disease over a mean follow-up of 14 years. The results were replicated in a pooled cohort of three independent datasets (TOPMed, deCODE and Penn Medicine BioBank; total n=441,445) and the effect of the most frequent damaging variant was experimentally validated. ResultsA total of 45 predicted LoF or damaging missense variants were identified in the CCR2 gene, 4 of which were also significantly associated with lower monocyte count, but not with other white blood cell counts. Heterozygous carriers of these variants were at a lower risk of a combined atherosclerosis outcome, showed a lower burden of atherosclerosis across four vascular beds, and were at a lower lifetime risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of association with vascular risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, glycemic status, or C-reactive protein. Using a cAMP assay, we found that cells transfected with the most frequent CCR2 damaging variant (3:46358273:T:A, M249K, 547 carriers, frequency: 0.14%) show a decrease in signaling in response to CCL2. The associations of the M249K variant with myocardial infarction were consistent across cohorts (ORUKB: 0.62 95%CI: 0.39-0.96; ORexternal: 0.64 95%CI: 0.34-1.19; ORpooled: 0.64 95%CI: 0.45-0.90). In a phenome-wide association study, we found no evidence for higher risk of common infections or mortality among carriers of damaging CCR2 variants. ConclusionsHeterozygous carriers of damaging CCR2 variants have a lower burden of atherosclerosis and lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction. In conjunction with previous evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies, our findings highlight the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.\nAssociation of blood pressure with cognitive impairment in elderly hypertensive patients in China: A cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Jia, Y.; Qi, S.; Yin, P.; Zhou, M.; Ji, F.; Wang, Z.; Yu, X.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.23294145\nAims: To investigate the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly Chinese patients with hypertension and explore the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the study examined the characteristics of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients and its impact on blood pressure control. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 23,271 subjects. Data collection involved questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood tests. AD8 questionnaire, MMSE questionnaire, and neurologist interview, was used to screen patients for cognitive disabilities. Risk factors and prevalence of cognitive impairment were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. The prevalence of cognitive impairment at different blood pressure levels was analyzed within the hypertension group. Differences in MMSE scores across dimensions were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. Results: The hypertensive group exhibited additional risk factors for cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypertensive patients followed a U-shaped curve with increasing blood pressure, with the lowest rate observed among patients with blood pressure in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Several dimensions of cognitive function were significantly diminished in individuals with hypertension. Patients with cognitive impairment demonstrated lower compliance with hypertension treatment and poorer blood pressure control. Conclusion: Cognitive decline across multiple dimensions is typical among older Chinese patients with hypertension, and cognitive impairment has detrimental effects on blood pressure management. Maintaining blood pressure in the 120-139/80-89 mmHg range appears to be more favorable for preserving cognitive function in hypertensive patients.\nPersonalized coronary and myocardial blood flow models incorporating synthetic vascular trees and CT perfusion imaging\nAuthors: Menon, K.; Khan, M. O.; Sexton, Z. A.; Richter, J.; Nieman, K.; Marsden, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294242\nComputational simulations of coronary artery blood flow are an emerging non-invasive tool for personalized clinical risk stratification and treatment planning. However, current simulations contend with two related challenges - the lack of personalized flow distributions informed by patient-specific data, and incomplete anatomies in image-based models due to the exclusion of arteries smaller than the imaging resolution. We introduce a data-enabled, personalized and multi-scale flow simulation framework spanning large coronary arteries to myocardial microvasculature. It includes image-based coronary models combined with synthetic vasculature for arteries below the imaging resolution, myocardial blood flow simulated using Darcy models, and systemic circulation represented as lumped-parameter networks. Personalized flow distributions and model parameters are estimated using surrogate-based optimization informed by clinically measured CT myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac function. We reveal substantial differences in flow distributions and clinical diagnosis metrics between the proposed personalized framework and empirical methods based on anatomy; these errors cannot be predicted a priori. This suggests virtual treatment planning tools would benefit from increased personalization informed by emerging imaging methods.\nHemodynamics with Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices Using a Cardiogenic Shock Model\nAuthors: Yahagi, K.; Nishimura, G.; kuramoto, k.; Tsuboko, Y.; Iwasaki, K.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294188\nBackgroundMechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, including veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and Impella, have been widely used for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). However, hemodynamics with each device and combination therapy is not thoroughly understood. We aimed to elucidate the hemodynamics with MCS using a CS pulsatile flow model. Methods and ResultsA pulsatile flow circulation system comprising a ventricle, aortic valve, mitral valve, elastic artery, and venous reservoir was developed. Hemodynamics with Impella CP, VA-ECMO, and a combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO were assessed based on the pressure and flow under support with each device and the pressure-volume loop of the ventricle model. The self-recirculation with Impella was assessed using particle image velocimetry. The Impella CP device with CS status resulted in increased afterload, leading to an increase in aortic pressure and a decrease in end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure (EDP). VA-ECMO support resulted in increased afterload, leading to a significant increase in aortic pressure with an increase in end-systolic volume and EDP and decreasing venous reservoir pressure. The combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of increase in afterload. Self-recirculation with Impella CP was observed in a patient with significant aortic insufficiency, leading to reduced hemodynamic support. ConclusionsThe Impella system improved hemodynamics with ventricular unloading. Hemodynamic support with Impella and VA-ECMO should be a promising combination for patients with severe CS. Physicians should be alert to the presence of significant aortic insufficiency, leading to self-recirculation with Impella. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is a non-clinical study using a novel experimental pulsatile flow system with venous function that can be used to assess MCS, including Impella and VA-ECMO. C_LIO_LIThe self-recirculation phenomenon of the Impella device was assessed by a flow visualization method using particle imaging velocimetry. C_LI What are the clinical implications?O_LIThe combination of Impella and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of the increase in afterload. C_LIO_LIVA-ECMO could increase arterial pressure owing to increased LV afterload and alter the direction of the aortic flow (antegrade or retrograde) depending on the flow level with VA-ECMO. C_LIO_LIEffective Impella flow was reduced during ventricular diastole when aortic insufficiency was present owing to self-recirculation with the Impella device. C_LI\nCYP2C19 and effect of clopidogrel for secondary prevention of major ischemic events: systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Kremers, F. C. C.; van den Biggelaar, J.; Lingsma, H. F.; van Schaik, R. H. N.; Roozenbeek, B.; Dippel, D. W.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23292850\nBackgroundCarriers of the CYP2C19 Loss of Function (LoF) allele may experience decreased efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary prevention after cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trials of clopidogrel in patients with known CYP2C19 carrier status provided inconsistent results. Our aim was to pool the evidence on the effect of clopidogrel on outcome, according to CYP2C19 LoF status, in a meta-analysis. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of clopidogrel according to CYP2C19 LoF status in patients with cardiovascular disease and recent TIA or stroke was performed. The primary outcomes were 1) ischemic stroke and 2) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We used random effects analysis to estimate the effect of clopidogrel as a pooled odds ratio (OR) in carriers and non-carriers of the LoF variant and tested for interaction between clopidogrel and CYP2C19. ResultsWe included six RCTs with a total of 15,141 participants comparing combined clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to aspirin monotherapy. The effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.70 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.13). In patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, the OR for the effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.52 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.02) while in patients with cardiovascular disease the difference in effect was not evident (non-variant carriers OR=0.76, variant carriers OR= 0.84, pinteraction=0.50). ConclusionOur meta-analysis could not establish that overall, clopidogrel is less effective in patients with a recent MI, minor stroke or TIA and a CYP2C19 LoF genotype. However, the size and direction of the difference in effect warrants further research. Registration - URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; Unique identifier: CRD42021242993.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMyocarditis is a recognized complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Emerging studies further suggest an associated risk of myocarditis following administration of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccinations. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. We investigated the incidence of myocarditis throughout the COVID-19 pandemic across a large healthcare system in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area.

MethodsThis retrospective analysis of patients admitted from 2017-2022. Myocarditis cases were temporally divided into two cohorts based on year of admission (pre-pandemic 2017-2019; pandemic 2020-2022), which were compared for overall myocarditis incidence. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.

ResultsThe cohort included 573 myocarditis patients (pre-pandemic=208, pandemic=365). From 2017-2019, the total number and rate of myocarditis cases was consistent. Overall cases of myocarditis increased during the pandemic (97, 126, 142 patients in 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively). Interestingly, the rate of myocarditis cases not related to COVID-19 or the vaccines stayed consistent (0.0674%, 0.0676%, 0.0807%), but the rate of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or the vaccines myocarditis increased each year (0.0210%, 0.0416%, 0.0480%). In-hospital mortality was similar between the two pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts (5.35% versus 7.7%, 0.276).

ConclusionAmong hospitalized patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of myocarditis increased as compared to the pre-pandemic era. It appears this increase is associated with either the SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. In-hospital outcomes did not differ during the pandemic, but ongoing research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of myocarditis during the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CCL2/CCR2 axis governs monocyte trafficking and recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions. Human genetic analyses and population-based studies support an association between circulating CCL2 levels and atherosclerosis. Still, it remains unknown whether pharmacological targeting of CCR2, the main CCL2 receptor, would provide protection against human atherosclerotic disease.

MethodsIn whole-exome sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants (40-69 years), we identified predicted loss-of-function (LoF) or damaging missense (REVEL score &gt;0.5) variants within the CCR2 gene. We prioritized variants associated with lower monocyte count (p&lt;0.05) and tested associations with vascular risk factors and risk of atherosclerotic disease over a mean follow-up of 14 years. The results were replicated in a pooled cohort of three independent datasets (TOPMed, deCODE and Penn Medicine BioBank; total n=441,445) and the effect of the most frequent damaging variant was experimentally validated.

ResultsA total of 45 predicted LoF or damaging missense variants were identified in the CCR2 gene, 4 of which were also significantly associated with lower monocyte count, but not with other white blood cell counts. Heterozygous carriers of these variants were at a lower risk of a combined atherosclerosis outcome, showed a lower burden of atherosclerosis across four vascular beds, and were at a lower lifetime risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of association with vascular risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, glycemic status, or C-reactive protein. Using a cAMP assay, we found that cells transfected with the most frequent CCR2 damaging variant (3:46358273:T:A, M249K, 547 carriers, frequency: 0.14%) show a decrease in signaling in response to CCL2. The associations of the M249K variant with myocardial infarction were consistent across cohorts (ORUKB: 0.62 95%CI: 0.39-0.96; ORexternal: 0.64 95%CI: 0.34-1.19; ORpooled: 0.64 95%CI: 0.45-0.90). In a phenome-wide association study, we found no evidence for higher risk of common infections or mortality among carriers of damaging CCR2 variants.

ConclusionsHeterozygous carriers of damaging CCR2 variants have a lower burden of atherosclerosis and lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction. In conjunction with previous evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies, our findings highlight the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims: To investigate the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly Chinese patients with hypertension and explore the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the study examined the characteristics of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients and its impact on blood pressure control. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 23,271 subjects. Data collection involved questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood tests. AD8 questionnaire, MMSE questionnaire, and neurologist interview, was used to screen patients for cognitive disabilities. Risk factors and prevalence of cognitive impairment were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. The prevalence of cognitive impairment at different blood pressure levels was analyzed within the hypertension group. Differences in MMSE scores across dimensions were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. Results: The hypertensive group exhibited additional risk factors for cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypertensive patients followed a U-shaped curve with increasing blood pressure, with the lowest rate observed among patients with blood pressure in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Several dimensions of cognitive function were significantly diminished in individuals with hypertension. Patients with cognitive impairment demonstrated lower compliance with hypertension treatment and poorer blood pressure control. Conclusion: Cognitive decline across multiple dimensions is typical among older Chinese patients with hypertension, and cognitive impairment has detrimental effects on blood pressure management. Maintaining blood pressure in the 120-139/80-89 mmHg range appears to be more favorable for preserving cognitive function in hypertensive patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computational simulations of coronary artery blood flow are an emerging non-invasive tool for personalized clinical risk stratification and treatment planning. However, current simulations contend with two related challenges - the lack of personalized flow distributions informed by patient-specific data, and incomplete anatomies in image-based models due to the exclusion of arteries smaller than the imaging resolution. We introduce a data-enabled, personalized and multi-scale flow simulation framework spanning large coronary arteries to myocardial microvasculature. It includes image-based coronary models combined with synthetic vasculature for arteries below the imaging resolution, myocardial blood flow simulated using Darcy models, and systemic circulation represented as lumped-parameter networks. Personalized flow distributions and model parameters are estimated using surrogate-based optimization informed by clinically measured CT myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac function. We reveal substantial differences in flow distributions and clinical diagnosis metrics between the proposed personalized framework and empirical methods based on anatomy; these errors cannot be predicted a priori. This suggests virtual treatment planning tools would benefit from increased personalization informed by emerging imaging methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, including veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and Impella, have been widely used for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). However, hemodynamics with each device and combination therapy is not thoroughly understood. We aimed to elucidate the hemodynamics with MCS using a CS pulsatile flow model.

Methods and ResultsA pulsatile flow circulation system comprising a ventricle, aortic valve, mitral valve, elastic artery, and venous reservoir was developed. Hemodynamics with Impella CP, VA-ECMO, and a combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO were assessed based on the pressure and flow under support with each device and the pressure-volume loop of the ventricle model. The self-recirculation with Impella was assessed using particle image velocimetry. The Impella CP device with CS status resulted in increased afterload, leading to an increase in aortic pressure and a decrease in end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure (EDP). VA-ECMO support resulted in increased afterload, leading to a significant increase in aortic pressure with an increase in end-systolic volume and EDP and decreasing venous reservoir pressure. The combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of increase in afterload. Self-recirculation with Impella CP was observed in a patient with significant aortic insufficiency, leading to reduced hemodynamic support.

ConclusionsThe Impella system improved hemodynamics with ventricular unloading. Hemodynamic support with Impella and VA-ECMO should be a promising combination for patients with severe CS. Physicians should be alert to the presence of significant aortic insufficiency, leading to self-recirculation with Impella.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is a non-clinical study using a novel experimental pulsatile flow system with venous function that can be used to assess MCS, including Impella and VA-ECMO.
C_LIO_LIThe self-recirculation phenomenon of the Impella device was assessed by a flow visualization method using particle imaging velocimetry.

What are the clinical implications?O_LIThe combination of Impella and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of the increase in afterload.
C_LIO_LIVA-ECMO could increase arterial pressure owing to increased LV afterload and alter the direction of the aortic flow (antegrade or retrograde) depending on the flow level with VA-ECMO.
C_LIO_LIEffective Impella flow was reduced during ventricular diastole when aortic insufficiency was present owing to self-recirculation with the Impella device.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCarriers of the CYP2C19 Loss of Function (LoF) allele may experience decreased efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary prevention after cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trials of clopidogrel in patients with known CYP2C19 carrier status provided inconsistent results. Our aim was to pool the evidence on the effect of clopidogrel on outcome, according to CYP2C19 LoF status, in a meta-analysis.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of clopidogrel according to CYP2C19 LoF status in patients with cardiovascular disease and recent TIA or stroke was performed. The primary outcomes were 1) ischemic stroke and 2) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We used random effects analysis to estimate the effect of clopidogrel as a pooled odds ratio (OR) in carriers and non-carriers of the LoF variant and tested for interaction between clopidogrel and CYP2C19.

ResultsWe included six RCTs with a total of 15,141 participants comparing combined clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to aspirin monotherapy. The effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.70 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.13). In patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, the OR for the effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.52 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.02) while in patients with cardiovascular disease the difference in effect was not evident (non-variant carriers OR=0.76, variant carriers OR= 0.84, pinteraction=0.50).

ConclusionOur meta-analysis could not establish that overall, clopidogrel is less effective in patients with a recent MI, minor stroke or TIA and a CYP2C19 LoF genotype. However, the size and direction of the difference in effect warrants further research.
