The prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has not been established in HF patients with diabetes. MethodsConsecutive patients (n=315) with HF underwent CMR at 3T, including GLS, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), native T1, and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) mapping. Plasma biomarker concentrations were measured including: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin T(hs-TnT), growth differentiation factor 15(GDF-15), soluble ST2(sST2) and galectin 3(Gal-3). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalisation. ResultsCompared to those without diabetes (n=156), the diabetes group (n=159) had a higher LGE prevalence (76 vs 60%, p\u003c0.05), higher T1 (1285{+/-}42 vs 1269{+/-}42ms, p\u003c0.001) and higher ECV (30.5{+/-}3.5 vs 28.8{+/-}4.1%, p\u003c0.001). The diabetes group had higher NT-pro-BNP, hs-TnT, GDF-15, sST2 and Gal-3. Diabetes conferred worse prognosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.79], p\u003c0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis including clinical markers and plasma biomarkers, GDF-15 and sST2 remained independently associated with the primary outcome (GDF-15: HR per 100 pg/mL 1.02 [95% CI 1.00-1.03], p=0.035; sST2: HR per 1 ng/mL 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.05], p=0.036). In multivariable Cox regression models in the diabetes group, GLS was prognostic (HR 1.15 [95% CI 1.06-1.25], p\u003c0.001). ConclusionsCompared to HF patients without diabetes, those with diabetes have worse plasma and CMR markers of fibrosis and a more adverse prognosis. GLS is a powerful and independent prognostic marker in HF patients with diabetes. Clinical PerspectivesPatients with concomitant heart failure and diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis. Our study demonstrates that this group has adverse plasma and CMR markers of myocardial fibrosis. Furthermore, we have shown that GLS is a powerful and independent prognostic marker in this group. Our results raise the future possibility of GLS-guided risk stratification and management in patients with heart failure and diabetes to improve outcomes in this group.\nLeukocytes carrying Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) Mutations invade Human Atherosclerotic Plaques\nAuthors: von Scheidt, M.; Bauer, S.; Ma, A.; Hao, K.; Kessler, T.; Vilne, B.; Wang, Y.; Hodonsky, C. J.; Gosh, S. K. B.; Mokry, M.; Gao, H.; Kawai, K.; Sakamoto, A.; Kaiser, J.; Bongiovanni, D.; Fleig, J.; Oldenbuettel, L.; Chen, Z.; Moggio, A.; Sager, H. B.; Hecker, J. S.; Bassermann, F.; Maegdefessel, L.; Miller, C. L.; Koenig, W.; Zeiher, A. M.; Dimmeler, S.; Graw, M.; Braun, C.; Ruusalepp, A.; Leeper, N.; Kovacic, J. C.; Bjorkegren, J. L. M.; Schunkert, H.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.23292754\nBackgroundLeukocyte progenitors derived from clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined potential (CHIP) are associated with increased cardiovascular events. However, the prevalence and functional relevance of CHIP in coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear, and cells affected by CHIP have not been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques. MethodsCHIP mutations in blood and tissues were identified by targeted deep-DNA-sequencing (DNAseq: coverage \u003e3,000) and whole-genome-sequencing (WGS: coverage \u003e35). CHIP-mutated leukocytes were visualized in human atherosclerotic plaques by mutaFISHTM. Functional relevance of CHIP mutations was studied by RNAseq. ResultsDNAseq of whole blood from 540 deceased CAD patients of the Munich cardIovaScular StudIes biObaNk (MISSION) identified 253 (46.9%) CHIP mutation carriers (mean age 78.3 years). DNAseq on myocardium, atherosclerotic coronary and carotid arteries detected identical CHIP mutations in 18 out of 25 mutation carriers in tissue DNA. MutaFISHTM visualized individual macrophages carrying DNMT3A CHIP mutations in human atherosclerotic plaques. Studying monocyte-derived macrophages from Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task (STARNET; n=941) by WGS revealed CHIP mutations in 14.2% (mean age 67.1 years). RNAseq of these macrophages revealed that expression patterns in CHIP mutation carriers differed substantially from those of non-carriers. Moreover, patterns were different depending on the underlying mutations, e.g. those carrying TET2 mutations predominantly displayed upregulated inflammatory signaling whereas ASXL1 mutations showed stronger effects on metabolic pathways. ConclusionsDeep-DNA-sequencing reveals a high prevalence of CHIP mutations in whole blood of CAD patients. CHIP-affected leukocytes invade plaques in human coronary arteries. RNAseq data obtained from macrophages of CHIP-affected patients suggest that pro-atherosclerotic signaling differs depending on the underlying mutations. Further studies are necessary to understand whether specific pathways affected by CHIP mutations may be targeted for personalized treatment.\nThe Cardiovascular Impact and Genetics of Pericardial Adiposity\nAuthors: Ramo, J. T.; Kany, S.; Hou, C. R.; Friedman, S. F.; Roselli, C.; Nauffal, V.; Koyama, S.; Karjalainen, J.; FinnGen, ; Maddah, M.; Palotie, A.; Ellinor, P. T.; Pirruccello, J. P.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292729\nBackgroundWhile previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of PAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of PAT in a large population cohort. MethodsA deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber magnetic resonance images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants. ResultsA total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex ({beta} = +0.76 SD in PAT), age (r = 0.15), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.55) (P \u003c 1x10-230). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure ({beta} = +0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes ({beta} = +0.56) than in coronary artery disease ({beta} = +0.22) or AF ({beta} = +0.18). PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per +1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during a mean 3.2 ({+/-}1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We identified 5 novel genetic loci for PAT and implicated transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1, EBF2 and CEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2 and TRIB2). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, heart failure, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per +1 SD in PGS, P \u003c 2x10-10). ConclusionsPAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal adiposity and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Clinical PerspectiveWhat is new? O_LIIn a large, prospective and uniformly phenotyped cohort, pericardial adipose tissue was independently predictive of incident heart failure and type 2 diabetes when adjusted for body mass index. C_LIO_LIIn contrast, pericardial adipose tissue was not independently predictive of atrial fibrillation. C_LIO_LIA genome-wide association study of pericardial adipose tissue identified five novel loci, implicating genes influencing adipocyte morphology, brown-like adipose tissue differentiation and abdominal adiposity. C_LI What are the clinical implications? O_LIPericardial adipose tissue accumulation may reflect a metabolically unhealthy adiposity phenotype similarly to abdominal visceral adiposity.

I.; Arruda-Olson, A.; Scott, C.; Prodduturi, N.; Nowakowski, S.; Rooke, T. W.; Casanegra, A.; Wysokinski, W. E.; Houghton, D. E.; Bjarnason, H.; Wennberg, P. W.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23293024\nBackgroundPatients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at increased risk for major adverse cardiac (MACE), limb (MALE) events and all-cause mortality. Developing tools capable of identifying those patients with PAD at greatest risk for major adverse events is the first step for outcome prevention. This study aimed to determine whether computer assisted analysis of a resting Doppler waveform using deep neural networks can accurately identify PAD patients at greatest risk for adverse outcome events. MethodsConsecutive patients (4/1/2015-12/31/2020) undergoing ankle brachial index (ABI) testing were included. Patients were randomly allocated to training, validation and testing subsets (60%/20%/20%). Deep neural networks were trained on resting posterior tibial arterial Doppler waveforms to predict MACE, MALE and all-cause mortality at 5 years. Patients were then analyzed in quartiles based on the distribution of each prediction score. ResultsAmong 11,384 total patients, 10,437 patients met study inclusion criteria (mean age 65.8{+/-}14.8 years; 40.6% female). The test subset included 2,084 patients. During 5 years of follow up, there were 447 deaths, 585 MACE and 161 MALE events. After adjusting for age, sex, and Charlson index, deep neural network analysis of the posterior tibial artery waveform provided independent prediction of death (Hazard ratio 2.45 95% confidence interval 1.79-3.36), MACE (HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.50-2.62) and MALE (HR 11.65 95%CI 5.65-24.04) at 5 years with similar results at 1 year. ConclusionAn artificial intelligence enabled analysis of a resting Doppler arterial waveform enables identification of major adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality, MACE and MALE among PAD patients.\nPositive Airway Pressure Therapy Predicts Lower Mortality and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Incidence in Medicare Beneficiaries with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\nAuthors: Mazzotti, D. R.; Waitman, L. R.; Miller, J.; Sundar, K. M.; Stewart, N.; Gozal, D.; Song, X.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293156\nBackgroundObesity is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiovascular risk. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment for OSA, but evidence on its beneficial effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) prevention is limited. Using claims data, the effects of PAP on mortality and incidence of MACE among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA were examined. MethodsA cohort of beneficiaries (\u003e65 years) with [\u0026ge;]5 years of consecutive enrolment to Medicare and [\u0026ge;]2 distinct OSA claims was defined from multi-state, state-wide, multi-year (2011-2017) Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Evidence of PAP initiation and utilisation was based on PAP claims after OSA diagnosis. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or coronary revascularisation. Doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weights estimated treatment effects controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors. ResultsAmong 225,132 beneficiaries with OSA (median age 74 years; 45.3% women; median follow-up 3 years), those with evidence of PAP initiation (50.1%) had significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR [95%CI]: 0.57 [0.56-0.59]) and MACE incidence risk (0.90 [0.88-0.92]). Higher quartiles of annual PAP claims were progressively associated with lower mortality (Q2: 0.80 [0.75-0.86], Q3: 0.68 [0.64-0.72], Q4: 0.65 [0.61-0.70]) and MACE incidence risk (Q2: 0.91 [0.86-0.97], Q3: 0.87 [0.82-0.91], Q4: 0.85 [0.80-0.90]). ConclusionPAP utilisation was associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE incidence among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA. Results might inform trials assessing the importance of OSA therapy towards minimising cardiovascular risk and mortality in older adults.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHeart failure (HF) and diabetes are associated with increased incidence and worse prognosis of each other. The prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has not been established in HF patients with diabetes.

MethodsConsecutive patients (n=315) with HF underwent CMR at 3T, including GLS, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), native T1, and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) mapping. Plasma biomarker concentrations were measured including: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin T(hs-TnT), growth differentiation factor 15(GDF-15), soluble ST2(sST2) and galectin 3(Gal-3). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalisation.

ResultsCompared to those without diabetes (n=156), the diabetes group (n=159) had a higher LGE prevalence (76 vs 60%, p&lt;0.05), higher T1 (1285{&#43;/-}42 vs 1269{&#43;/-}42ms, p&lt;0.001) and higher ECV (30.5{&#43;/-}3.5 vs 28.8{&#43;/-}4.1%, p&lt;0.001). The diabetes group had higher NT-pro-BNP, hs-TnT, GDF-15, sST2 and Gal-3. Diabetes conferred worse prognosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.79], p&lt;0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis including clinical markers and plasma biomarkers, GDF-15 and sST2 remained independently associated with the primary outcome (GDF-15: HR per 100 pg/mL 1.02 [95% CI 1.00-1.03], p=0.035; sST2: HR per 1 ng/mL 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.05], p=0.036). In multivariable Cox regression models in the diabetes group, GLS was prognostic (HR 1.15 [95% CI 1.06-1.25], p&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsCompared to HF patients without diabetes, those with diabetes have worse plasma and CMR markers of fibrosis and a more adverse prognosis. GLS is a powerful and independent prognostic marker in HF patients with diabetes.

Clinical PerspectivesPatients with concomitant heart failure and diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis. Our study demonstrates that this group has adverse plasma and CMR markers of myocardial fibrosis. Furthermore, we have shown that GLS is a powerful and independent prognostic marker in this group. Our results raise the future possibility of GLS-guided risk stratification and management in patients with heart failure and diabetes to improve outcomes in this group.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLeukocyte progenitors derived from clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined potential (CHIP) are associated with increased cardiovascular events. However, the prevalence and functional relevance of CHIP in coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear, and cells affected by CHIP have not been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques.

MethodsCHIP mutations in blood and tissues were identified by targeted deep-DNA-sequencing (DNAseq: coverage &gt;3,000) and whole-genome-sequencing (WGS: coverage &gt;35). CHIP-mutated leukocytes were visualized in human atherosclerotic plaques by mutaFISHTM. Functional relevance of CHIP mutations was studied by RNAseq.

ResultsDNAseq of whole blood from 540 deceased CAD patients of the Munich cardIovaScular StudIes biObaNk (MISSION) identified 253 (46.9%) CHIP mutation carriers (mean age 78.3 years). DNAseq on myocardium, atherosclerotic coronary and carotid arteries detected identical CHIP mutations in 18 out of 25 mutation carriers in tissue DNA. MutaFISHTM visualized individual macrophages carrying DNMT3A CHIP mutations in human atherosclerotic plaques. Studying monocyte-derived macrophages from Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task (STARNET; n=941) by WGS revealed CHIP mutations in 14.2% (mean age 67.1 years). RNAseq of these macrophages revealed that expression patterns in CHIP mutation carriers differed substantially from those of non-carriers. Moreover, patterns were different depending on the underlying mutations, e.g. those carrying TET2 mutations predominantly displayed upregulated inflammatory signaling whereas ASXL1 mutations showed stronger effects on metabolic pathways.

ConclusionsDeep-DNA-sequencing reveals a high prevalence of CHIP mutations in whole blood of CAD patients. CHIP-affected leukocytes invade plaques in human coronary arteries. RNAseq data obtained from macrophages of CHIP-affected patients suggest that pro-atherosclerotic signaling differs depending on the underlying mutations. Further studies are necessary to understand whether specific pathways affected by CHIP mutations may be targeted for personalized treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWhile previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of PAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of PAT in a large population cohort.

MethodsA deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber magnetic resonance images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants.

ResultsA total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex ({beta} = &#43;0.76 SD in PAT), age (r = 0.15), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.55) (P &lt; 1x10-230). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure ({beta} = &#43;0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes ({beta} = &#43;0.56) than in coronary artery disease ({beta} = &#43;0.22) or AF ({beta} = &#43;0.18). PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per &#43;1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during a mean 3.2 ({&#43;/-}1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We identified 5 novel genetic loci for PAT and implicated transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1, EBF2 and CEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2 and TRIB2). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, heart failure, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per &#43;1 SD in PGS, P &lt; 2x10-10).

ConclusionsPAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal adiposity and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes and heart failure.

Clinical PerspectiveWhat is new? O_LIIn a large, prospective and uniformly phenotyped cohort, pericardial adipose tissue was independently predictive of incident heart failure and type 2 diabetes when adjusted for body mass index.
C_LIO_LIIn contrast, pericardial adipose tissue was not independently predictive of atrial fibrillation.
C_LIO_LIA genome-wide association study of pericardial adipose tissue identified five novel loci, implicating genes influencing adipocyte morphology, brown-like adipose tissue differentiation and abdominal adiposity.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications? O_LIPericardial adipose tissue accumulation may reflect a metabolically unhealthy adiposity phenotype similarly to abdominal visceral adiposity.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPatients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at increased risk for major adverse cardiac (MACE), limb (MALE) events and all-cause mortality. Developing tools capable of identifying those patients with PAD at greatest risk for major adverse events is the first step for outcome prevention. This study aimed to determine whether computer assisted analysis of a resting Doppler waveform using deep neural networks can accurately identify PAD patients at greatest risk for adverse outcome events.

MethodsConsecutive patients (4/1/2015-12/31/2020) undergoing ankle brachial index (ABI) testing were included. Patients were randomly allocated to training, validation and testing subsets (60%/20%/20%). Deep neural networks were trained on resting posterior tibial arterial Doppler waveforms to predict MACE, MALE and all-cause mortality at 5 years. Patients were then analyzed in quartiles based on the distribution of each prediction score.

ResultsAmong 11,384 total patients, 10,437 patients met study inclusion criteria (mean age 65.8{&#43;/-}14.8 years; 40.6% female). The test subset included 2,084 patients. During 5 years of follow up, there were 447 deaths, 585 MACE and 161 MALE events. After adjusting for age, sex, and Charlson index, deep neural network analysis of the posterior tibial artery waveform provided independent prediction of death (Hazard ratio 2.45 95% confidence interval 1.79-3.36), MACE (HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.50-2.62) and MALE (HR 11.65 95%CI 5.65-24.04) at 5 years with similar results at 1 year.

ConclusionAn artificial intelligence enabled analysis of a resting Doppler arterial waveform enables identification of major adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality, MACE and MALE among PAD patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObesity is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiovascular risk. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment for OSA, but evidence on its beneficial effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) prevention is limited. Using claims data, the effects of PAP on mortality and incidence of MACE among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA were examined.

MethodsA cohort of beneficiaries (&gt;65 years) with [&amp;ge;]5 years of consecutive enrolment to Medicare and [&amp;ge;]2 distinct OSA claims was defined from multi-state, state-wide, multi-year (2011-2017) Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Evidence of PAP initiation and utilisation was based on PAP claims after OSA diagnosis. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or coronary revascularisation. Doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weights estimated treatment effects controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors.

ResultsAmong 225,132 beneficiaries with OSA (median age 74 years; 45.3% women; median follow-up 3 years), those with evidence of PAP initiation (50.1%) had significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR [95%CI]: 0.57 [0.56-0.59]) and MACE incidence risk (0.90 [0.88-0.92]). Higher quartiles of annual PAP claims were progressively associated with lower mortality (Q2: 0.80 [0.75-0.86], Q3: 0.68 [0.64-0.72], Q4: 0.65 [0.61-0.70]) and MACE incidence risk (Q2: 0.91 [0.86-0.97], Q3: 0.87 [0.82-0.91], Q4: 0.85 [0.80-0.90]).

ConclusionPAP utilisation was associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE incidence among Medicare beneficiaries with OSA. Results might inform trials assessing the importance of OSA therapy towards minimising cardiovascular risk and mortality in older adults.</p>
