C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24302037\nBackgroundUsual clinical testing rarely reveals cardiac abnormalities persisting after hospitalization for COVID-19. Such testing may overlook residual changes responsible for increased adverse cardiac events post-discharge. MethodsTo further elucidate long-term status, we performed exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) in 15 patients age 30-63 without myocarditis 3 to 31 months after hospital discharge. We compared patient outcomes to published data in healthy comparisons (HC) exercising according to the same protocol. ResultsPatients treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol), averaging 8.2 min, was halted by dyspnea or fatigue. Pre-stress baselines in recovering patients (RP) matched HC except for higher heart rate: mean 81 bpm for RP and 63 for HC (p\u003c0.0001). At peak stress, RP had significantly lower mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (67% vs 73%, p\u003c0.0017) and higher peak early mitral inflow velocity/early mitral annular velocity (E/e, 9.1 vs 6.6, p\u003c0.006) compared with HC performing equal exercise (8.5 min). Thus, when stressed, patients without known cardiac impairment showed modest but consistently diminished systolic contractile function and diastolic LV compliance during recovery vs HC. Peak HR during stress was significantly elevated in RP vs HC; peak SBP also trended higher. Average pulmonary artery systolic pressures among RP remained normal. ConclusionsOur measurements during ESE uniquely identified residual abnormality in cardiac contractile function not evident in the unstressed condition. This finding exposes a previously-unrecognized residual influence of COVID-19, possibly related to underlying autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, or diffuse interstitial changes after subclinical myocarditis; it may have long-term implications for clinical management and later prognosis. CLINICAL PERSPECTIVENew Findings (relative to a historical comparison group) O_LISymptom-limited treadmill exercise 3-31 months after hospitalization with COVID-19 without overt myocarditis elicited a lesser rise in left ventricular ejection fraction than seen in similar subjects with no exposure to COVID-19. C_LIO_LIThe same symptom-limited exercise in these patients revealed evidence of diminished left ventricular diastolic function relative to subjects with no exposure to COVID-19. C_LIO_LIThese distinctive differences in left ventricular function were observed although overall exercise capacity was the same as in the uninfected comparison group. C_LI Clinical Implications O_LIPrior hospitalization with COVID-19 even in the absence of overt myocarditis was often associated with a modest but consistent decrement in left ventricular systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation; these functional abnormalities were evident after peak treadmill exercise stress despite lack of distinctive difference in contractile parameters at rest.

B.; Lumbang, G. N.; Gaid, D. R. M.; Cruz, L. L.; Magalong, J. V.; Bantayan, N. R.; Lara-Breitinger, K. M.; Gulati, M.; Bakris, G. L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301971\nBackgroundThe cardiovascular benefits provided by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) extend beyond weight reduction and glycemic control. One possible mechanism may relate to blood pressure (BP) reduction. We aim to quantify the BP lowering effect by GLP1-RAs. MethodsA comprehensive database search for placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on GLP-1RA treatment was conducted until December 2023. Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out, employing a robust statistical analysis using a random effects model to determine outcomes with mean difference (MD) in millimeters mercury (mmHg) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary endpoint was the mean difference in systolic and diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were done to account for covariates. ResultsCompared to placebo, GLP-1RAs modestly reduced SBP (semaglutide: MD -3.40, [95% CI -4.22 to -2.59, p\u003c0.001], liraglutide: MD -2.61, [95% CI -3.48 to -1.74, p\u003c0.001], dulaglutide: MD -1.46, [95% CI -2.20 to -0.72, p\u003c0.001] and exenatide: MD -3.36, [95% CI - 3.63 to -3.10, p\u003c0.001]). This benefit consistently increased with longer treatment duration. Established people with type 2 diabetes experienced less SBP lowering with semaglutide. DBP reduction was only significant in the exenatide group (MD -0.94, [95% CI -1.78 to -0.1], p=0.03). Among semaglutide cohorts, mean change in hemoglobin A1c and mean change in body mass index were directly associated with SBP reduction. ConclusionPatients on GLP-1RA experienced modest SBP lowering compared to placebo. Only exenatide reduced DBP. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms and the clinical benefit of GLP-1RA effects in BP reduction.\n",

Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out, employing a robust statistical analysis using a random effects model to determine outcomes with mean difference (MD) in millimeters mercury (mmHg) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary endpoint was the mean difference in systolic and diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were done to account for covariates.

ResultsCompared to placebo, GLP-1RAs modestly reduced SBP (semaglutide: MD -3.40, [95% CI -4.22 to -2.59, p&lt;0.001], liraglutide: MD -2.61, [95% CI -3.48 to -1.74, p&lt;0.001], dulaglutide: MD -1.46, [95% CI -2.20 to -0.72, p&lt;0.001] and exenatide: MD -3.36, [95% CI - 3.63 to -3.10, p&lt;0.001]). This benefit consistently increased with longer treatment duration. Established people with type 2 diabetes experienced less SBP lowering with semaglutide. DBP reduction was only significant in the exenatide group (MD -0.94, [95% CI -1.78 to -0.1], p=0.03). Among semaglutide cohorts, mean change in hemoglobin A1c and mean change in body mass index were directly associated with SBP reduction.

ConclusionPatients on GLP-1RA experienced modest SBP lowering compared to placebo. Only exenatide reduced DBP. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms and the clinical benefit of GLP-1RA effects in BP reduction.</p>
