L.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293846\nEpigenetic changes in gene expression due to DNA methylation are important physiologic and pathologic regulators of pulmonary vascular structure and function. Genetic or acquired alterations in DNA methylation or demethylation have been associated with the development and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the DNA methylome signature of human PAH and its consequences on the PAH transcriptome are unknown. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used for epigenome-wide mapping of DNA methylation in whole peripheral blood of 10 healthy people and 20 age/sex matched PAH patients. RNA deep sequencing was performed in parallel on the same samples. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify two PAH cohorts, one free of mutations in the genes know to be associated with PAH patients and the second had mutations of TET2, a newly identified PAH gene that encodes an enzyme that mediates DNA demethylation. We report an increased in global DNA methylation in the blood of PAH patients compared to healthy controls. Patients carrying the TET2 mutation had a further increase in DNA compared to mutation free PAH patients. We identified 1,069 unique Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) in the blood of PAH patients with a TET2 mutation. When organized into functional groups, we observed an enrichment of genes involved in immune, cell differentiation, or metabolic. When we compared these genes to publicly available data from an independent study on blood from PAH patients compared to controls, we identified 218 mRNA transcripts that align with our data (e.g. are hypermethylated blood genes that are downregulated in PAH blood), and functional analysis of these genes reveals common enriched terms in immune, cell differentiation, or metabolic function. We characterized DNA methylation changes associated with TET2 mutation in the blood of patients with PAH compared to controls. This data demonstrates that epigenetic regulation of genes by methylation is involved in altered immune function, cell differentiation and metabolism in PAH.\nInfluenza Vaccination and Major Cardiovascular Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials Studies\nAuthors: Omidi, F.; Zangiabadian, M.; Shahidi Bonjar, A. H.; Nasiri, M. J.; Sarmastzadeh, T.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.23293585\nBackgroundCardiovascular events remain a substantial global health concern, necessitating innovative strategies for prevention. This study aims to assess the potential impact of influenza vaccination on major cardiovascular events. MethodsA search of the medical English literature was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL up to 1 August 2023. Meta-analysis and stratified analyses were performed to investigate specific outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular death, and stroke. Pooled relative risks (RR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the associations. ResultsA comprehensive analysis was conducted on a total of 9059 patients, with 4529 patients receiving the influenza vaccine and 4530 patients receiving a placebo. Among patients who received the influenza vaccine, a notable reduction in the occurrence of major cardiovascular events was observed, with 517 cases compared to 621 cases in the placebo group (RR, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.55-0.91). The stratified analysis revealed a decreased risk of MI in vaccinated patients (RR, 0.74; 95%CI, 0.56-0.97) and a significant reduction in cardiovascular death events (RR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.98). ConclusionThis study provides compelling evidence that influenza vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. These findings highlight the potential of influenza vaccination as an adjunctive strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention. Further research and exploration of underlying mechanisms are warranted to elucidate the observed beneficial effects.\nHemodynamics Indicates Differences Between Patients With And Without A Stroke Outcome After Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation\nAuthors: Sahni, A.; Majee, S.; Pal, J. D.; McIntyre, E. E.; Cao, K.; Mukherjee, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23292572\nStroke remains a leading cause of complications and mortality in heart failure patients treated with LVAD circulatory support. Hemodynamics plays a central role in affecting risk and etiology of stroke during LVAD support. Yet, detailed quantitative assessment of hemodynamic variables and their relation to stroke outcomes in patients with an implanted LVAD remains a challenge. We present an in silico hemodynamics analysis in a set of 12 patients on LVAD support; 6 with reported stroke outcomes and 6 without. We conducted patient-specific hemodynamics simulations for models with the LVAD outflow graft reconstructed from cardiac-gated CT images. A pre-implantation baseline flow model was virtually generated for each case by removing the LVAD outflow graft and driving flow from the aortic root. Hemodynamics was characterized using quantitative descriptors for helical flow, vortex generation, and wall shear stress. Our analysis showed higher average values for descriptors of positive helical flow, vortex generation, and wall shear stress, across the 6 cases with stroke outcomes on LVAD support, when compared with cases without stroke. When the descriptors for LVAD-driven flow were compared against estimated baseline flow pre-implantation, extent of positive helicity was higher, and vorticity and wall shear were lower in cases with stroke compared to those without. The study suggests that quantitative analysis of hemodynamics after LVAD implantation; and hemodynamic alterations from a pre-implant flow scenario, can potentially reveal hidden information linked to stroke outcomes during LVAD support. This has broad implications on understanding stroke etiology, LVAD treatment planning, surgical optimization, and efficacy assessment.\nThe Pulse of Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology: A Comprehensive Evaluation of State-of-the-art Large Language Models for Potential Use in Clinical Cardiology\nAuthors: Novak, A.; Rode, F.; Lisicic, A.; Nola, I. A.; Zeljkovic, I.; Pavlovic, N.; Manola, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293689\nIntroduction: During the last few years, we have witnessed a surge in the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse applications in clinical medicine. Their utility extends to enhancing ECG interpretation, data analysis, and risk prediction in cardiology. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLMs in answering cardiology-specific questions of various difficulty levels. Methods: This study undertakes a comparative analysis of three state of the art LLMs: Google Bard, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.0, against four distinct sets of clinical scenarios of increasing complexity. The clinical scenarios encompass a range of cardiovascular topics, from prevention to acute illness management and complex pathologies. The responses generated by the LLMs were evaluated for their clinical relevance and appropriateness, considering variations in patient demographics. The evaluations were conducted by an experienced panel of cardiologists. Results: All models showed an understanding of medical terminology, but the application of this knowledge varied. GPT-4.0 outperforms Google Bard and GPT-3.5 Turbo across a spectrum of cardiology-related clinical scenarios, demonstrating a strong understanding of medical terminology, contextual understanding and most proficiently aligning its responses with current guidelines. Limitations were seen in the models' abilities to reference ongoing clinical trials, demonstrating a need for real-time clinical data integration. Conclusion: LLMs showed promising results in ability to interpret and apply complex clinical guidelines, with a potential for enhancing patient outcomes through personalized advice. However, they do not supersede human expertise and should be utilized with a grain of salt, as supplementary tools in clinical medicine.\n",

The stratified analysis revealed a decreased risk of MI in vaccinated patients (RR, 0.74; 95%CI, 0.56-0.97) and a significant reduction in cardiovascular death events (RR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.98).

ConclusionThis study provides compelling evidence that influenza vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. These findings highlight the potential of influenza vaccination as an adjunctive strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention. Further research and exploration of underlying mechanisms are warranted to elucidate the observed beneficial effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stroke remains a leading cause of complications and mortality in heart failure patients treated with LVAD circulatory support. Hemodynamics plays a central role in affecting risk and etiology of stroke during LVAD support. Yet, detailed quantitative assessment of hemodynamic variables and their relation to stroke outcomes in patients with an implanted LVAD remains a challenge. We present an in silico hemodynamics analysis in a set of 12 patients on LVAD support; 6 with reported stroke outcomes and 6 without. We conducted patient-specific hemodynamics simulations for models with the LVAD outflow graft reconstructed from cardiac-gated CT images. A pre-implantation baseline flow model was virtually generated for each case by removing the LVAD outflow graft and driving flow from the aortic root. Hemodynamics was characterized using quantitative descriptors for helical flow, vortex generation, and wall shear stress. Our analysis showed higher average values for descriptors of positive helical flow, vortex generation, and wall shear stress, across the 6 cases with stroke outcomes on LVAD support, when compared with cases without stroke. When the descriptors for LVAD-driven flow were compared against estimated baseline flow pre-implantation, extent of positive helicity was higher, and vorticity and wall shear were lower in cases with stroke compared to those without. The study suggests that quantitative analysis of hemodynamics after LVAD implantation; and hemodynamic alterations from a pre-implant flow scenario, can potentially reveal hidden information linked to stroke outcomes during LVAD support. This has broad implications on understanding stroke etiology, LVAD treatment planning, surgical optimization, and efficacy assessment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: During the last few years, we have witnessed a surge in the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse applications in clinical medicine. Their utility extends to enhancing ECG interpretation, data analysis, and risk prediction in cardiology. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLMs in answering cardiology-specific questions of various difficulty levels. Methods: This study undertakes a comparative analysis of three state of the art LLMs: Google Bard, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.0, against four distinct sets of clinical scenarios of increasing complexity. The clinical scenarios encompass a range of cardiovascular topics, from prevention to acute illness management and complex pathologies. The responses generated by the LLMs were evaluated for their clinical relevance and appropriateness, considering variations in patient demographics. The evaluations were conducted by an experienced panel of cardiologists. Results: All models showed an understanding of medical terminology, but the application of this knowledge varied. GPT-4.0 outperforms Google Bard and GPT-3.5 Turbo across a spectrum of cardiology-related clinical scenarios, demonstrating a strong understanding of medical terminology, contextual understanding and most proficiently aligning its responses with current guidelines. Limitations were seen in the models&#39; abilities to reference ongoing clinical trials, demonstrating a need for real-time clinical data integration. Conclusion: LLMs showed promising results in ability to interpret and apply complex clinical guidelines, with a potential for enhancing patient outcomes through personalized advice. However, they do not supersede human expertise and should be utilized with a grain of salt, as supplementary tools in clinical medicine.</p>
