J.; Leary, M. E.; Leary, B. K.; Au, J. S.; Tenan, M. S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294449\nBackground: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a common measure of autonomic and cardiovascular system function assessed via electrocardiography (ECG). Consumer wearables, commonly employed in epidemiological research, use photoplethysmography (PPG) to report HRV metrics (PRV), although these may not be equivalent. One potential cause of dissociation between HRV and PRV is the variability in pulse transit time (PTT). This study sought to determine if PPG-derived HRV (i.e., PRV) is equivalent to ECG-derived HRV and ascertain if PRV measurement error is sufficient for a biomarker separate from HRV. Methods: The ECG data from 1,084 subjects were obtained from the PhysioNet Autonomic Aging dataset, and individual PTT variances for both the wrist (n=42) and finger (n=49) were derived from Mol et al. A Bayesian simulation was constructed whereby the individual arrival times of the PPG wave were calculated by placing a Gaussian prior on the individual QRS-wave timings of each ECG series. The standard deviation of the prior corresponds to the PTT variances. This was simulated 10,000 times for each PTT variance. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN) were calculated for both HRV and PRV. The Region of Practical Equivalence bounds (ROPE) were set a priori at 0.2% of true HRV. The Highest Density Interval (HDI) width, encompassing 95% of the posterior distribution, was calculated for each PTT variance. Results: The lowest PTT variance (2.0 SD) corresponded to 88.4% within ROPE for SDNN and 21.4% for RMSSD. As the SD of PTT increases, the equivalence of PRV and HRV decreases for both SDNN and RMSSD. Thus, between PRV and HRV, RMSSD is nearly never equivalent and SDNN is only somewhat equivalent under very strict circumstances. The HDI interval width increases with increasing PTT variance, with the HDI width increasing at a higher rate for RMSSD than SDNN. Conclusions: For individuals with greater PTT variability, PRV is not a surrogate for HRV. When considering PRV as a unique biometric measure, our findings reveal that SDNN has more favorable measurement properties than RMSSD, though both exhibit a non-uniform measurement error.\nNatural Language Processing for Adjudication of Heart Failure Hospitalizations in a Multi-Center Clinical Trial\nAuthors: Cunningham, J. W.; Singh, P.; Reeder, C.; Claggett, B.; Marti-Castellote, P. M.; Lau, E. S.; Khurshid, S.; Batra, P.; Lubitz, S.; Maddah, M.; Philippakis, A.; Desai, A.; Ellinor, P. T.; Vardeny, O.; Solomon, S. D.; Ho, J. E.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294234\nBackgroundThe gold standard for outcome adjudication in clinical trials is chart review by a physician clinical events committee (CEC), which requires substantial time and expertise. Automated adjudication by natural language processing (NLP) may offer a more resource-efficient alternative. We previously showed that the Community Care Cohort Project (C3PO) NLP model adjudicates heart failure (HF) hospitalizations accurately within one healthcare system. MethodsThis study externally validated the C3PO NLP model against CEC adjudication in the INVESTED trial. INVESTED compared influenza vaccination formulations in 5260 patients with cardiovascular disease at 157 North American sites. A central CEC adjudicated the cause of hospitalizations from medical records. We applied the C3PO NLP model to medical records from 4060 INVESTED hospitalizations and evaluated agreement between the NLP and final consensus CEC HF adjudications. We then fine-tuned the C3PO NLP model (C3PO+INVESTED) and trained a de novo model using half the INVESTED hospitalizations, and evaluated these models in the other half. NLP performance was benchmarked to CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility. Results1074 hospitalizations (26%) were adjudicated as HF by the CEC. There was high agreement between the C3PO NLP and CEC HF adjudications (agreement 87%, kappa statistic 0.69). C3PO NLP model sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 84%. The fine-tuned C3PO and de novo NLP models demonstrated agreement of 93% and kappa of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility was 94% (kappa 0.85). ConclusionOur NLP model developed within a single healthcare system accurately identified HF events relative to the gold-standard CEC in an external multi-center clinical trial. Fine-tuning the model improved agreement and approximated human reproducibility. NLP may improve the efficiency of future multi-center clinical trials by accurately identifying clinical events at scale.\nExercise stress in healthy adults: normal ranges for real time cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\nAuthors: Schweitzer, R.; de Marvao, A.; Shah, M.; Inglese, P.; Kellman, P.; Berry, A.; Statton, B.; O'Regan, D. P.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294458\nBackground: Real-time (RT) exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (exCMR) is an emerging approach for cardiac stress testing as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular imaging assessment. It has advantages over alternative approaches due to its high spatial resolution and use of non-pharmacological stress. As access to exCMR increases, there is a need to establish reference ranges in healthy adults for clinical interpretation. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults who had no known cardiovascular disease, did not harbour genetic variants associated with cardiomyopathy, and who completed an exCMR protocol using a pedal ergometer. Participants were imaged at rest and after exercise with left ventricular parameters measured using commercial software by two readers. Prediction intervals were calculated for each parameter. Results: Exercise caused an increase in heart rate (64{+/-}9 bpm vs 133{+/-}19 bpm, P \u003c 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (140{+/-}32 ml vs 148{+/-}36 ml, P \u003c 0.001), stroke volume (82{+/-}18 ml vs 102{+/-}26 ml, P \u003c 0.001), ejection fraction (59{+/-}6% vs 69{+/-}7%, P \u003c 0.001), and cardiac output (5.2{+/-}1.2 l/min vs 10.0{+/-}3.1 l/min, P \u003c 0.001), with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (58{+/-}18 ml vs 46{+/-}16 ml, P \u003c 0.001). There was an effect of gender and age on response to exercise across most parameters. Measurements showed moderate to excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement. Conclusion: In healthy adults, an increase in cardiac output after exercise is driven by a rise in heart rate with both increased ventricular filling and emptying. We establish normal ranges for exercise response, stratified by age and gender, as a reference for the use of exCMR in clinical practice.\nThe impact of Gam-COVID-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26 COVID-19 vaccine, on the biomarkers of endothelial function, coagulation and platelet activation\nAuthors: Turmukhambetova, A.; Yegorov, S.; Korshukov, I.; Barkhanskaya, V.; Kolesnichenko, S.; Klyuyev, D.; Zhumadilova, Z.; Pralieva, A.; Absaghit, L.; Belyayev, R.; Babenko, D.; Hortelano, G. H.; Miller, M. S.; Vazenmiller, D.; Kadyrova, I.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294400\nBackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Although overall considered safe, COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with rare but severe thrombotic events, occurring mainly in the context of adenoviral vectored vaccines. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced hypercoagulability and prothrombotic state is needed to improve vaccine safety profile. MethodsWe assessed changes to the biomarkers of endothelial function (endothelin, ET-1), coagulation (thrombomodulin, THBD and plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI) and platelet activation (platelet activating factor, PAF, and platelet factor 4 IgG antibody, PF4 IgG) within a three-week period after the first (prime) and second (boost) doses of Gam-Covid-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Blood plasma collected from vaccinees (n=58) was assayed using ELISA assays. Participants were stratified by prior COVID-19 exposure based on their baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific serology results. ResultsWe observed a significant post-prime increase in circulating ET-1, with levels sustained after the boost dose compared to baseline. ET-1 elevation following dose 2 was most pronounced in vaccinees without prior COVID-19 exposure. Prior COVID-19 was also associated with a mild increase in post-dose 1 PAI. ConclusionsVaccination was associated with elevated ET-1 up to day 21 after the second vaccine dose, while no marked alterations to other biomarkers, including PF4 IgG, were seen. A role of persistent endothelial activation followingCOVID-19 vaccination warrants further investigation.\nPrevalence of Modifiable Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease among School-going Children and Adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya.\nAuthors: Magutah, K.; Mbuthia, G. W.; Osengo, G.; Odhiambo, D.; Meiring, R.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294556\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in Kenya is rising. Overweight, pre-hypertension and physical inactivity in younger ages is contributory. These risk factors are inadequately documented among Kenyan children and adolescents, hampering CVD prevention. This cross-sectional study randomly sampled 384 school children and adolescents. After obtaining assent and consent, global physical activity (PA) questionnaire was used to assess PA. Body mass index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHtR) were determined. Blood pressure (BP) was also measured. Participants were 14.6{+/-}2.7 years, and 62.6% were female. Overall BMI was 19.8{+/-}3.9 kg/m2 with 8% having [\u0026ge;]25.0 kg/m2, 87% of whom were in secondary schools. Using SBP, 27.9% were at risk of CVD. For age [\u0026ge;]13 years old, males and females proportions were 42.5% and 20% respectively while that for \u003c13 years old, it was 26.5% and 27% respectively. For DBP, 12.8% had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. For ages [\u0026ge;] 13 years old, this was 13.2% and 8.3% for males and females respectively and for the \u003c13 years old, the respective percentages were 11.8 and 25.4. Combining SBP and DBP, 8.1% of participants, mostly males, had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. Thirty-one percent of boys and 15.6% of girls were at CVD risk using respective WHR cutoffs of 0.90 and 0.85 (males, 0.93{+/-}0.02 ; females, 0.89{+/-}0.03). For WHtR, 39.6% of boys had values \u003e0.463 cut-off (0.493{+/-}0.02), with 52.6% in secondary schools against 32.4% for girls having \u003e0.469 cut-off (0.517{+/-}0.05), 69.7% being in secondary schools. Overall, 45% of participants were sports-inactive and 77.2% did minimal PA. Among school-going children and adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya, prevalence of CVD risk-factors was high especially among boys and in high schools. Large proportions had elevated BP, BMI, WHR and WHtR, and, further, were sedentary, posing high CVD risk. Lifestyle interventions to mitigate this public health concern among children and adolescent are urgently needed.\nAssociation of blood pressure with cognitive impairment in elderly hypertensive patients in China: A cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Jia, Y.; Qi, S.; Yin, P.; Zhou, M.; Ji, F.; Wang, Z.; Yu, X.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.23294145\nAimsTo investigate the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly Chinese patients with hypertension and explore the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the study examined the characteristics of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients and its impact on blood pressure control. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted involving 23,271 subjects. Data collection involved questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood tests. AD8 questionnaire, MMSE questionnaire, and neurologist interview, was used to screen patients for cognitive disabilities. Risk factors and prevalence of cognitive impairment were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. The prevalence of cognitive impairment at different blood pressure levels was analyzed within the hypertension group. Differences in MMSE scores across dimensions were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. ResultsThe hypertensive group exhibited additional risk factors for cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypertensive patients followed a U-shaped curve with increasing blood pressure, with the lowest rate observed among patients with blood pressure in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Several dimensions of cognitive function were significantly diminished in individuals with hypertension. Patients with cognitive impairment demonstrated lower compliance with hypertension treatment and poorer blood pressure control. ConclusionCognitive decline across multiple dimensions is typical among older Chinese patients with hypertension, and cognitive impairment has detrimental effects on blood pressure management. Maintaining blood pressure in the 120-139/80-89 mmHg range appears to be more favorable for preserving cognitive function in hypertensive patients.\nKnowledge, Attitudes and Demand Toward Cardiovascular Polygenic Risk Testing in Clinical Practice: Cross-Sectional Survey of Patients\nAuthors: Brar, S.; Townsend, J.; Phulka, J. S.; Halperin, L.; Liew, J.; Parker, J. D.; Brunham, L. R.; Laksman, Z.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294594\nBackground: The goal of this study was to assess patients' prior exposure and current level of knowledge of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We also explored reactions to receiving a high-risk or low-risk score, and gauged the overall attitudes and demand patients have with regards to PRSs. Methods: We developed an online investigator-designed survey based on existing validated tools and previously designed surveys on genetic testing. There were two versions of the survey, one including a hypothetical high-risk PRS and one with a low-risk PRS. We administered the survey among patients attending a specialized cardiovascular prevention clinic. Results: A total of 226 participants responded to the survey. The study population was predominantly high-income earning, educated, and of European descent. 177 patients (79%) had never read or heard about polygenic testing. 209 patients (93%) had never discussed polygenic testing with their health care professional (HCP). 208 patients (93%) had never received polygenic testing. The average score on the knowledge quiz was 2.47/10 [95% C.I. (2.17, 2.78)]. Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 20.52/35 [95% C.I. (16.14, 24.9)] with regards to negative emotions while low-risk survey participants scored 17.96/35 [95% C.I. (13.98, 21.94)] (p\u003c0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 5.78/10 [95% C.I. (3.77, 7.79)] with regards to uncertainty and low-risk survey participants scored 4.34/10 [95% C.I. (2.50, 6.18)] (p\u003c0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 12.42/15 [95% C.I. (10.43, 14.41)] for demand and low-risk survey participants scored 12.22/15 [95% C.I. (9.66, 14.78)] (p=0.549). Conclusions: Patients have limited prior exposure and knowledge of PRSs. Compared to receiving a low-risk score, participants receiving a high-risk score have more negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty. Despite the lack of knowledge, and the high rate of negative emotions and uncertainty, demand for PRSs in cardiology practice is high and expected to increase.\nPersonalized coronary and myocardial blood flow models incorporating CT perfusion imaging and synthetic vascular trees\nAuthors: Menon, K.; Khan, M. O.; Sexton, Z. A.; Richter, J.; Nieman, K.; Marsden, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294242\nComputational simulations of coronary artery blood flow are an emerging non-invasive tool for personalized clinical risk stratification and treatment planning. However, current simulations contend with two related challenges - the lack of personalized flow distributions informed by patient-specific data, and incomplete anatomies in image-based models due to the exclusion of arteries smaller than the imaging resolution. We introduce a data-enabled, personalized and multi-scale flow simulation framework spanning large coronary arteries to myocardial microvasculature. It includes image-based coronary models combined with synthetic vasculature for arteries below the imaging resolution, myocardial blood flow simulated using Darcy models, and systemic circulation represented as lumped-parameter networks. Personalized flow distributions and model parameters are estimated using surrogate-based optimization informed by clinically measured CT myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac function. We reveal substantial differences in flow distributions and clinical diagnosis metrics between the proposed personalized framework and empirical methods based on anatomy; these errors cannot be predicted a priori. This suggests virtual treatment planning tools would benefit from increased personalization informed by emerging imaging methods.\nHemodynamics with Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices Using a Cardiogenic Shock Model\nAuthors: Yahagi, K.; Nishimura, G.; kuramoto, k.; Tsuboko, Y.; Iwasaki, K.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294188\nBackgroundMechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, including veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and Impella, have been widely used for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). However, hemodynamics with each device and combination therapy is not thoroughly understood. We aimed to elucidate the hemodynamics with MCS using a CS pulsatile flow model. Methods and ResultsA pulsatile flow circulation system comprising a ventricle, aortic valve, mitral valve, elastic artery, and venous reservoir was developed. Hemodynamics with Impella CP, VA-ECMO, and a combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO were assessed based on the pressure and flow under support with each device and the pressure-volume loop of the ventricle model. The self-recirculation with Impella was assessed using particle image velocimetry. The Impella CP device with CS status resulted in increased afterload, leading to an increase in aortic pressure and a decrease in end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure (EDP). VA-ECMO support resulted in increased afterload, leading to a significant increase in aortic pressure with an increase in end-systolic volume and EDP and decreasing venous reservoir pressure. The combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of increase in afterload. Self-recirculation with Impella CP was observed in a patient with significant aortic insufficiency, leading to reduced hemodynamic support. ConclusionsThe Impella system improved hemodynamics with ventricular unloading. Hemodynamic support with Impella and VA-ECMO should be a promising combination for patients with severe CS. Physicians should be alert to the presence of significant aortic insufficiency, leading to self-recirculation with Impella. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is a non-clinical study using a novel experimental pulsatile flow system with venous function that can be used to assess MCS, including Impella and VA-ECMO. C_LIO_LIThe self-recirculation phenomenon of the Impella device was assessed by a flow visualization method using particle imaging velocimetry. C_LI What are the clinical implications?O_LIThe combination of Impella and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of the increase in afterload. C_LIO_LIVA-ECMO could increase arterial pressure owing to increased LV afterload and alter the direction of the aortic flow (antegrade or retrograde) depending on the flow level with VA-ECMO. C_LIO_LIEffective Impella flow was reduced during ventricular diastole when aortic insufficiency was present owing to self-recirculation with the Impella device. C_LI\nCYP2C19 and effect of clopidogrel for secondary prevention of major ischemic events: systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Kremers, F. C. C.; van den Biggelaar, J.; Lingsma, H. F.; van Schaik, R. H. N.; Roozenbeek, B.; Dippel, D. W.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23292850\nBackgroundCarriers of the CYP2C19 Loss of Function (LoF) allele may experience decreased efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary prevention after cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trials of clopidogrel in patients with known CYP2C19 carrier status provided inconsistent results. Our aim was to pool the evidence on the effect of clopidogrel on outcome, according to CYP2C19 LoF status, in a meta-analysis. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of clopidogrel according to CYP2C19 LoF status in patients with cardiovascular disease and recent TIA or stroke was performed. The primary outcomes were 1) ischemic stroke and 2) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We used random effects analysis to estimate the effect of clopidogrel as a pooled odds ratio (OR) in carriers and non-carriers of the LoF variant and tested for interaction between clopidogrel and CYP2C19. ResultsWe included six RCTs with a total of 15,141 participants comparing combined clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to aspirin monotherapy. The effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.70 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.13). In patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, the OR for the effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.52 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.02) while in patients with cardiovascular disease the difference in effect was not evident (non-variant carriers OR=0.76, variant carriers OR= 0.84, pinteraction=0.50). ConclusionOur meta-analysis could not establish that overall, clopidogrel is less effective in patients with a recent MI, minor stroke or TIA and a CYP2C19 LoF genotype. However, the size and direction of the difference in effect warrants further research. Registration - URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; Unique identifier: CRD42021242993.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a common measure of autonomic and cardiovascular system function assessed via electrocardiography (ECG). Consumer wearables, commonly employed in epidemiological research, use photoplethysmography (PPG) to report HRV metrics (PRV), although these may not be equivalent. One potential cause of dissociation between HRV and PRV is the variability in pulse transit time (PTT). This study sought to determine if PPG-derived HRV (i.e., PRV) is equivalent to ECG-derived HRV and ascertain if PRV measurement error is sufficient for a biomarker separate from HRV. Methods: The ECG data from 1,084 subjects were obtained from the PhysioNet Autonomic Aging dataset, and individual PTT variances for both the wrist (n=42) and finger (n=49) were derived from Mol et al. A Bayesian simulation was constructed whereby the individual arrival times of the PPG wave were calculated by placing a Gaussian prior on the individual QRS-wave timings of each ECG series. The standard deviation of the prior corresponds to the PTT variances. This was simulated 10,000 times for each PTT variance. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN) were calculated for both HRV and PRV. The Region of Practical Equivalence bounds (ROPE) were set a priori at 0.2% of true HRV. The Highest Density Interval (HDI) width, encompassing 95% of the posterior distribution, was calculated for each PTT variance. Results: The lowest PTT variance (2.0 SD) corresponded to 88.4% within ROPE for SDNN and 21.4% for RMSSD. As the SD of PTT increases, the equivalence of PRV and HRV decreases for both SDNN and RMSSD. Thus, between PRV and HRV, RMSSD is nearly never equivalent and SDNN is only somewhat equivalent under very strict circumstances. The HDI interval width increases with increasing PTT variance, with the HDI width increasing at a higher rate for RMSSD than SDNN. Conclusions: For individuals with greater PTT variability, PRV is not a surrogate for HRV. When considering PRV as a unique biometric measure, our findings reveal that SDNN has more favorable measurement properties than RMSSD, though both exhibit a non-uniform measurement error.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe gold standard for outcome adjudication in clinical trials is chart review by a physician clinical events committee (CEC), which requires substantial time and expertise. Automated adjudication by natural language processing (NLP) may offer a more resource-efficient alternative. We previously showed that the Community Care Cohort Project (C3PO) NLP model adjudicates heart failure (HF) hospitalizations accurately within one healthcare system.

MethodsThis study externally validated the C3PO NLP model against CEC adjudication in the INVESTED trial. INVESTED compared influenza vaccination formulations in 5260 patients with cardiovascular disease at 157 North American sites. A central CEC adjudicated the cause of hospitalizations from medical records. We applied the C3PO NLP model to medical records from 4060 INVESTED hospitalizations and evaluated agreement between the NLP and final consensus CEC HF adjudications. We then fine-tuned the C3PO NLP model (C3PO&#43;INVESTED) and trained a de novo model using half the INVESTED hospitalizations, and evaluated these models in the other half. NLP performance was benchmarked to CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility.

Results1074 hospitalizations (26%) were adjudicated as HF by the CEC. There was high agreement between the C3PO NLP and CEC HF adjudications (agreement 87%, kappa statistic 0.69). C3PO NLP model sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 84%. The fine-tuned C3PO and de novo NLP models demonstrated agreement of 93% and kappa of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility was 94% (kappa 0.85).

ConclusionOur NLP model developed within a single healthcare system accurately identified HF events relative to the gold-standard CEC in an external multi-center clinical trial. Fine-tuning the model improved agreement and approximated human reproducibility. NLP may improve the efficiency of future multi-center clinical trials by accurately identifying clinical events at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Real-time (RT) exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (exCMR) is an emerging approach for cardiac stress testing as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular imaging assessment. It has advantages over alternative approaches due to its high spatial resolution and use of non-pharmacological stress. As access to exCMR increases, there is a need to establish reference ranges in healthy adults for clinical interpretation. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults who had no known cardiovascular disease, did not harbour genetic variants associated with cardiomyopathy, and who completed an exCMR protocol using a pedal ergometer. Participants were imaged at rest and after exercise with left ventricular parameters measured using commercial software by two readers. Prediction intervals were calculated for each parameter. Results: Exercise caused an increase in heart rate (64{&#43;/-}9 bpm vs 133{&#43;/-}19 bpm, P &lt; 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (140{&#43;/-}32 ml vs 148{&#43;/-}36 ml, P &lt; 0.001), stroke volume (82{&#43;/-}18 ml vs 102{&#43;/-}26 ml, P &lt; 0.001), ejection fraction (59{&#43;/-}6% vs 69{&#43;/-}7%, P &lt; 0.001), and cardiac output (5.2{&#43;/-}1.2 l/min vs 10.0{&#43;/-}3.1 l/min, P &lt; 0.001), with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (58{&#43;/-}18 ml vs 46{&#43;/-}16 ml, P &lt; 0.001). There was an effect of gender and age on response to exercise across most parameters. Measurements showed moderate to excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement. Conclusion: In healthy adults, an increase in cardiac output after exercise is driven by a rise in heart rate with both increased ventricular filling and emptying. We establish normal ranges for exercise response, stratified by age and gender, as a reference for the use of exCMR in clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Although overall considered safe, COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with rare but severe thrombotic events, occurring mainly in the context of adenoviral vectored vaccines. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced hypercoagulability and prothrombotic state is needed to improve vaccine safety profile.

MethodsWe assessed changes to the biomarkers of endothelial function (endothelin, ET-1), coagulation (thrombomodulin, THBD and plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI) and platelet activation (platelet activating factor, PAF, and platelet factor 4 IgG antibody, PF4 IgG) within a three-week period after the first (prime) and second (boost) doses of Gam-Covid-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Blood plasma collected from vaccinees (n=58) was assayed using ELISA assays. Participants were stratified by prior COVID-19 exposure based on their baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific serology results.

ResultsWe observed a significant post-prime increase in circulating ET-1, with levels sustained after the boost dose compared to baseline. ET-1 elevation following dose 2 was most pronounced in vaccinees without prior COVID-19 exposure. Prior COVID-19 was also associated with a mild increase in post-dose 1 PAI.

ConclusionsVaccination was associated with elevated ET-1 up to day 21 after the second vaccine dose, while no marked alterations to other biomarkers, including PF4 IgG, were seen. A role of persistent endothelial activation followingCOVID-19 vaccination warrants further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in Kenya is rising. Overweight, pre-hypertension and physical inactivity in younger ages is contributory. These risk factors are inadequately documented among Kenyan children and adolescents, hampering CVD prevention. This cross-sectional study randomly sampled 384 school children and adolescents. After obtaining assent and consent, global physical activity (PA) questionnaire was used to assess PA. Body mass index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHtR) were determined. Blood pressure (BP) was also measured. Participants were 14.6{&#43;/-}2.7 years, and 62.6% were female. Overall BMI was 19.8{&#43;/-}3.9 kg/m2 with 8% having [&amp;ge;]25.0 kg/m2, 87% of whom were in secondary schools. Using SBP, 27.9% were at risk of CVD. For age [&amp;ge;]13 years old, males and females proportions were 42.5% and 20% respectively while that for &lt;13 years old, it was 26.5% and 27% respectively. For DBP, 12.8% had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. For ages [&amp;ge;] 13 years old, this was 13.2% and 8.3% for males and females respectively and for the &lt;13 years old, the respective percentages were 11.8 and 25.4. Combining SBP and DBP, 8.1% of participants, mostly males, had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. Thirty-one percent of boys and 15.6% of girls were at CVD risk using respective WHR cutoffs of 0.90 and 0.85 (males, 0.93{&#43;/-}0.02 ; females, 0.89{&#43;/-}0.03). For WHtR, 39.6% of boys had values &gt;0.463 cut-off (0.493{&#43;/-}0.02), with 52.6% in secondary schools against 32.4% for girls having &gt;0.469 cut-off (0.517{&#43;/-}0.05), 69.7% being in secondary schools. Overall, 45% of participants were sports-inactive and 77.2% did minimal PA. Among school-going children and adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya, prevalence of CVD risk-factors was high especially among boys and in high schools. Large proportions had elevated BP, BMI, WHR and WHtR, and, further, were sedentary, posing high CVD risk. Lifestyle interventions to mitigate this public health concern among children and adolescent are urgently needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimsTo investigate the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly Chinese patients with hypertension and explore the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the study examined the characteristics of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients and its impact on blood pressure control.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted involving 23,271 subjects. Data collection involved questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood tests. AD8 questionnaire, MMSE questionnaire, and neurologist interview, was used to screen patients for cognitive disabilities. Risk factors and prevalence of cognitive impairment were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. The prevalence of cognitive impairment at different blood pressure levels was analyzed within the hypertension group. Differences in MMSE scores across dimensions were compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups.

ResultsThe hypertensive group exhibited additional risk factors for cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypertensive patients followed a U-shaped curve with increasing blood pressure, with the lowest rate observed among patients with blood pressure in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Several dimensions of cognitive function were significantly diminished in individuals with hypertension. Patients with cognitive impairment demonstrated lower compliance with hypertension treatment and poorer blood pressure control.

ConclusionCognitive decline across multiple dimensions is typical among older Chinese patients with hypertension, and cognitive impairment has detrimental effects on blood pressure management. Maintaining blood pressure in the 120-139/80-89 mmHg range appears to be more favorable for preserving cognitive function in hypertensive patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The goal of this study was to assess patients&#39; prior exposure and current level of knowledge of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We also explored reactions to receiving a high-risk or low-risk score, and gauged the overall attitudes and demand patients have with regards to PRSs. Methods: We developed an online investigator-designed survey based on existing validated tools and previously designed surveys on genetic testing. There were two versions of the survey, one including a hypothetical high-risk PRS and one with a low-risk PRS. We administered the survey among patients attending a specialized cardiovascular prevention clinic. Results: A total of 226 participants responded to the survey. The study population was predominantly high-income earning, educated, and of European descent. 177 patients (79%) had never read or heard about polygenic testing. 209 patients (93%) had never discussed polygenic testing with their health care professional (HCP). 208 patients (93%) had never received polygenic testing. The average score on the knowledge quiz was 2.47/10 [95% C.I. (2.17, 2.78)]. Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 20.52/35 [95% C.I. (16.14, 24.9)] with regards to negative emotions while low-risk survey participants scored 17.96/35 [95% C.I. (13.98, 21.94)] (p&lt;0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 5.78/10 [95% C.I. (3.77, 7.79)] with regards to uncertainty and low-risk survey participants scored 4.34/10 [95% C.I. (2.50, 6.18)] (p&lt;0.001). Participants that received a high-risk survey scored 12.42/15 [95% C.I. (10.43, 14.41)] for demand and low-risk survey participants scored 12.22/15 [95% C.I. (9.66, 14.78)] (p=0.549). Conclusions: Patients have limited prior exposure and knowledge of PRSs. Compared to receiving a low-risk score, participants receiving a high-risk score have more negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty. Despite the lack of knowledge, and the high rate of negative emotions and uncertainty, demand for PRSs in cardiology practice is high and expected to increase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computational simulations of coronary artery blood flow are an emerging non-invasive tool for personalized clinical risk stratification and treatment planning. However, current simulations contend with two related challenges - the lack of personalized flow distributions informed by patient-specific data, and incomplete anatomies in image-based models due to the exclusion of arteries smaller than the imaging resolution. We introduce a data-enabled, personalized and multi-scale flow simulation framework spanning large coronary arteries to myocardial microvasculature. It includes image-based coronary models combined with synthetic vasculature for arteries below the imaging resolution, myocardial blood flow simulated using Darcy models, and systemic circulation represented as lumped-parameter networks. Personalized flow distributions and model parameters are estimated using surrogate-based optimization informed by clinically measured CT myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac function. We reveal substantial differences in flow distributions and clinical diagnosis metrics between the proposed personalized framework and empirical methods based on anatomy; these errors cannot be predicted a priori. This suggests virtual treatment planning tools would benefit from increased personalization informed by emerging imaging methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, including veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and Impella, have been widely used for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). However, hemodynamics with each device and combination therapy is not thoroughly understood. We aimed to elucidate the hemodynamics with MCS using a CS pulsatile flow model.

Methods and ResultsA pulsatile flow circulation system comprising a ventricle, aortic valve, mitral valve, elastic artery, and venous reservoir was developed. Hemodynamics with Impella CP, VA-ECMO, and a combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO were assessed based on the pressure and flow under support with each device and the pressure-volume loop of the ventricle model. The self-recirculation with Impella was assessed using particle image velocimetry. The Impella CP device with CS status resulted in increased afterload, leading to an increase in aortic pressure and a decrease in end-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure (EDP). VA-ECMO support resulted in increased afterload, leading to a significant increase in aortic pressure with an increase in end-systolic volume and EDP and decreasing venous reservoir pressure. The combination of Impella CP and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of increase in afterload. Self-recirculation with Impella CP was observed in a patient with significant aortic insufficiency, leading to reduced hemodynamic support.

ConclusionsThe Impella system improved hemodynamics with ventricular unloading. Hemodynamic support with Impella and VA-ECMO should be a promising combination for patients with severe CS. Physicians should be alert to the presence of significant aortic insufficiency, leading to self-recirculation with Impella.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is a non-clinical study using a novel experimental pulsatile flow system with venous function that can be used to assess MCS, including Impella and VA-ECMO.
C_LIO_LIThe self-recirculation phenomenon of the Impella device was assessed by a flow visualization method using particle imaging velocimetry.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIThe combination of Impella and VA-ECMO led to left ventricular unloading, regardless of the increase in afterload.
C_LIO_LIVA-ECMO could increase arterial pressure owing to increased LV afterload and alter the direction of the aortic flow (antegrade or retrograde) depending on the flow level with VA-ECMO.
C_LIO_LIEffective Impella flow was reduced during ventricular diastole when aortic insufficiency was present owing to self-recirculation with the Impella device.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCarriers of the CYP2C19 Loss of Function (LoF) allele may experience decreased efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary prevention after cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trials of clopidogrel in patients with known CYP2C19 carrier status provided inconsistent results. Our aim was to pool the evidence on the effect of clopidogrel on outcome, according to CYP2C19 LoF status, in a meta-analysis.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of clopidogrel according to CYP2C19 LoF status in patients with cardiovascular disease and recent TIA or stroke was performed. The primary outcomes were 1) ischemic stroke and 2) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We used random effects analysis to estimate the effect of clopidogrel as a pooled odds ratio (OR) in carriers and non-carriers of the LoF variant and tested for interaction between clopidogrel and CYP2C19.

ResultsWe included six RCTs with a total of 15,141 participants comparing combined clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to aspirin monotherapy. The effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.70 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.13). In patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, the OR for the effect of clopidogrel on MACE was OR=0.52 in CYP2C19 non-variant carriers compared to OR=0.84 in CYP2C19 variant carriers (pinteraction=0.02) while in patients with cardiovascular disease the difference in effect was not evident (non-variant carriers OR=0.76, variant carriers OR= 0.84, pinteraction=0.50).

ConclusionOur meta-analysis could not establish that overall, clopidogrel is less effective in patients with a recent MI, minor stroke or TIA and a CYP2C19 LoF genotype. However, the size and direction of the difference in effect warrants further research.
