J.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.23298088\nBackground and aimsInhibitors of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC3) are currently approved for the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome. We used drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effect of genetically predicted decrease in APOC3 blood protein levels on cardiometabolic traits and diseases. MethodsWe quantified lifelong reductions in APOC3 blood levels by selecting all genome wide significant and independent (r2\u003c0.1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOC3 gene region {+/-}1Mb, from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of apoC3 blood protein levels (deCODE, n = 35,378, Fenland, n = 10,708 and ARIC, n = 7,213). We included the largest GWASes on 18 cardiometabolica traits and 9 cardiometabolic diseases as study outcomes. ResultsA one standard deviation lowering in apoC3 blood protein levels was associated with lower triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and glomerular filtration rate as well as higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. APOC3 lowering was also associated with lower risk of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91 95% CI=0.82 to 1.00), aortic stenosis (OR = 0.82 95% CI=0.73 to 0.93), and coronary artery disease (OR = 0.86 95% CI=0.80 to 0.93), and was associated with increased parental lifespan (0.06 95% CI=0.03 to 0.09 years). These results were concordant across robust MR methods, the three protein datasets and upon adjustment for APOA1, APOA4 and APOA5 using a multivariable MR framework. ConclusionsThese results provide evidence that apoC3 lowering could result in widespread benefits for cardiometabolic health and encourage the launch of trials on apoC3 inhibition for coronary artery disease prevention.\nDynamic Importance of Genomic and Clinical Risk for Coronary Artery Disease Over the Life Course\nAuthors: Urbut, S. M.; Cho, S. M. J.; Paruchuri, K.; Truong, B.; HAIDERMOTA, S.; Peloso, G. M.; Hornsby, W.; Philippakis, A.; Fahed, A. C.; Natarajan, P.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298055\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSEarlier identification of high coronary artery disease (CAD) risk individuals may enable more effective prevention strategies. However, existing 10-year risk frameworks are ineffective at earlier identification. Understanding the variable importance of genomic and clinical factors across life stages may significantly improve lifelong CAD event prediction. ObjectiveTo assess the time-varying significance of genomic and clinical risk factors in CAD risk estimation across various age groups. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA longitudinal study was performed using data from two cohort studies: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) with 3,588 participants aged 19-57 years and the UK Biobank (UKB) with 327,837 participants aged 40-70 years. A total of 134,765 and 3,831,734 person-time years were observed in FOS and UKB, respectively. Main Outcomes and MeasuresHazard ratios (HR) for CAD were calculated for polygenic risk scores (PRS) and clinical risk factors at each age of enrollment. The relative importance of PRS and Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) in predicting CAD events was also evaluated by age groups. ResultsThe importance of CAD PRS diminished over the life course, with an HR of 3.58 (95% CI 1.39-9.19) at age 19 in FOS and an HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.48-1.54) by age 70 in UKB. Clinical risk factors exhibited similar age-dependent trends. PRS significantly outperformed PCE in identifying subsequent CAD events in the 40-45-year age group, with 3.2-fold more appropriately identified events. The mean age of CAD events occurred 1.8 years earlier for those at high genomic risk but 9.6 years later for those at high clinical risk (p\u003c0.001). Overall, adding PRS improved the area under the receiving operating curve of the PCE by an average of +5.1% (95% CI 4.9-5.2%) across all age groups; among individuals \u003c55 years, PRS augmented the AUC-ROC of the PCE by 6.5% (95% CI 5.5-7.5%, p\u003c0.001). Conclusions and RelevanceGenomic and clinical risk factors for CAD display time-varying importance across the lifespan. The study underscores the added value of CAD PRS, particularly among individuals younger than 55 years, for enhancing early risk prediction and prevention strategies. Key Points QuestionHow do genomic and clinical risk factors contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk across a broad age range? FindingsThis longitudinal observational study across two cohorts found that both genomic and clinical risk factors exhibit age-dependent significance for CAD risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are most informative for individuals younger than 55 years, improving the predictive accuracy of current risk equations for these individuals. MeaningThe study emphasizes the need to incorporate the dynamic effects of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly genomic risk, for more accurate early-life risk prediction and efficient CAD prevention strategies.\nInsights into KIF11 pathogenesis in Microcephaly-Lymphedema-Chorioretinopathy syndrome: a lymphatic perspective.\nAuthors: Ogmen, K.; Dobbins, S.; Martinez-Corral, I.; Behncke, R. Y.; Brown, R. C.; Ulferts, S.; Hansmeier, N. R.; Sackey, E.; Alqahtani, A.; Karapouliou, C.; Grigoriadis, D.; Oberlin, M.; Williams, D.; Ekici, A.; Karaer, K.; Jeffery, S.; Mortimer, P.; Gordon, K.; Hogan, B.; Makinen, T.; Haegerling, R.; Mansour, S.; Martin-Almedina, S.; Ostergaard, P.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297090\nPathogenic variants in kinesin KIF11 underlie microcephaly-lymphedema-chorioretinopathy (MLC) syndrome. Although well known for regulating spindle dynamics ensuring successful cell division, the association of KIF11 (encoding EG5) with development of the lymphatic system, and how KIF11 pathogenic variants lead to lymphatic dysfunction and lymphedema remain unknown. Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, we demonstrate that MLC patients carrying pathogenic stop-gain variants in KIF11 have reduced mRNA and protein levels. Lymphoscintigraphy showed reduced tracer absorption, and intestinal lymphangiectasia was detected in one patient, pointing to impairment of lymphatic function caused by KIF11 haploinsufficiency. We reveal that KIF11 is expressed in early human and mouse development with the lymphatic markers VEGFR3, Podoplanin and PROX1. In zebrafish, scRNA-seq identified KIF11 specifically expressed in endothelial precursors. In human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), EG5 inhibition with Ispinesib, reduces VEGFC-driven AKT phosphorylation, migration and spheroid sprouting. KIF11 knockdown reduces PROX1 and VEGFR3 expression, providing for the first time a link between KIF11 and drivers of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic identity.\nEvaluation of Prompts to Simplify Cardiovascular Disease Information Using a Large Language Model\nAuthors: Mishra, V.; Sarraju, A.; Kalwani, N. M.; Dexter, J. P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298225\nAI chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging as an important source of public-facing medical information. Generative models hold promise for producing tailored guidance at scale, which could advance health literacy and mitigate well-known disparities in the accessibility of health-protective information. In this study, we highlight an important limitation of basic approaches to AI-powered text simplification: when given a zero-shot or one-shot simplification prompt, GPT-4 often responds by omitting critical details. To address this limitation, we developed a new prompting strategy, which we term rubric prompting. Rubric prompts involve a combination of a zero-shot simplification prompt with brief reminders about important topics to address. Using rubric prompts, we generate recommendations about cardiovascular disease prevention that are more complete, more readable, and have lower syntactic complexity than baseline responses produced without prompt engineering. This analysis provides a blueprint for rigorous evaluation of AI model outputs in medicine.\nCardiovascular risk prediction using metabolomic biomarkers and polygenic risk scores: A cohort study and modelling analyses\nAuthors: Ritchie, S. C.; Jiang, X.; Pennells, L.; Xu, Y.; Coffey, C.; Liu, Y.; Surendran, P.; Karthikeyan, S.; Lambert, S. A.; Danesh, J.; Butterworth, A. S.; Wood, A.; Kaptoge, S.; Di Angelantonio, E.; Inouye, M.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297859\nMetabolomic platforms using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can now rapidly quantify many circulating metabolites which are potential biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.\nOutcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Protected versus Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Disease: Insights from the VA CART Program\nAuthors: Engel, P.; Hebbe, A. L.; Hussain, Y.; Khera, R.; Banerjee, S.; Plomondon, M.; Waldo, S. W.; Pfau, S. E.; Curtis, J. P.; Shah, S. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297698\nBackgroundPractice patterns and outcomes of protected left main (PLM) and unprotected left main (ULM) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as the differences between these types of PCI, are not well defined in real-world clinical practice. MethodsData collected from all Veteran Affairs (VA) catheterization laboratories participating in the Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking Program between 2009 and 2019. The analysis included 4,351 patients undergoing left main PCI, of which 1,306 pairs of PLM and ULM PCI were included in a propensity matched cohort. Patients and procedural characteristics were compared between PLM and ULM PCI. Temporal trends were also assessed. Peri-procedural and one-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were compared using cumulative incidence plots. The primary outcome was MACE outcomes at 1-year, which was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, rehospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI), rehospitalization for stroke or urgent revascularization. ResultsULM PCI patients in comparison to PLM PCI were older (71.5 vs 69.2; P \u003c 0.001), more clinically complex and more likely to present with ACS. In the propensity matched cohort, radial access was used more often for ULM PCI (21% [273] vs. 14% [185], P \u003c 0.001), and ULM PCI was more likely to involve the LM bifurcation (22% vs 14%; P = 0.003) and require mechanical circulatory support (10% [134] vs 1% [17]; P \u003c0.001). One-year MACE occurred more frequently with ULM PCI compared to PLM PCI (22% [289] vs. 16% [215]; P = \u003c 0.001) and all-cause mortality was also higher (16% [213] vs. 10% [125]; P = \u003c 0.001). In the matched cohort there was a low incidence of rehospitalization for MI (4% [48] ULM vs. 4% [48] PLM; P = 1.000) or revascularization (7% [94] ULM vs. 6% [84] PLM; P = 0.485). ConclusionsVeterans undergoing PLM PCI had better one-year outcomes than those undergoing ULM PCI, but in both groups there was a high rate of mortality and MACE at one-year despite a relatively low rate of MI or revascularization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimsInhibitors of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC3) are currently approved for the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome. We used drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effect of genetically predicted decrease in APOC3 blood protein levels on cardiometabolic traits and diseases.

MethodsWe quantified lifelong reductions in APOC3 blood levels by selecting all genome wide significant and independent (r2&lt;0.1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOC3 gene region {&#43;/-}1Mb, from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of apoC3 blood protein levels (deCODE, n = 35,378, Fenland, n = 10,708 and ARIC, n = 7,213). We included the largest GWASes on 18 cardiometabolica traits and 9 cardiometabolic diseases as study outcomes.

ResultsA one standard deviation lowering in apoC3 blood protein levels was associated with lower triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and glomerular filtration rate as well as higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. APOC3 lowering was also associated with lower risk of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91 95% CI=0.82 to 1.00), aortic stenosis (OR = 0.82 95% CI=0.73 to 0.93), and coronary artery disease (OR = 0.86 95% CI=0.80 to 0.93), and was associated with increased parental lifespan (0.06 95% CI=0.03 to 0.09 years). These results were concordant across robust MR methods, the three protein datasets and upon adjustment for APOA1, APOA4 and APOA5 using a multivariable MR framework.

ConclusionsThese results provide evidence that apoC3 lowering could result in widespread benefits for cardiometabolic health and encourage the launch of trials on apoC3 inhibition for coronary artery disease prevention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSEarlier identification of high coronary artery disease (CAD) risk individuals may enable more effective prevention strategies. However, existing 10-year risk frameworks are ineffective at earlier identification. Understanding the variable importance of genomic and clinical factors across life stages may significantly improve lifelong CAD event prediction.

ObjectiveTo assess the time-varying significance of genomic and clinical risk factors in CAD risk estimation across various age groups.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA longitudinal study was performed using data from two cohort studies: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) with 3,588 participants aged 19-57 years and the UK Biobank (UKB) with 327,837 participants aged 40-70 years. A total of 134,765 and 3,831,734 person-time years were observed in FOS and UKB, respectively.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresHazard ratios (HR) for CAD were calculated for polygenic risk scores (PRS) and clinical risk factors at each age of enrollment. The relative importance of PRS and Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) in predicting CAD events was also evaluated by age groups.

ResultsThe importance of CAD PRS diminished over the life course, with an HR of 3.58 (95% CI 1.39-9.19) at age 19 in FOS and an HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.48-1.54) by age 70 in UKB. Clinical risk factors exhibited similar age-dependent trends. PRS significantly outperformed PCE in identifying subsequent CAD events in the 40-45-year age group, with 3.2-fold more appropriately identified events. The mean age of CAD events occurred 1.8 years earlier for those at high genomic risk but 9.6 years later for those at high clinical risk (p&lt;0.001). Overall, adding PRS improved the area under the receiving operating curve of the PCE by an average of &#43;5.1% (95% CI 4.9-5.2%) across all age groups; among individuals &lt;55 years, PRS augmented the AUC-ROC of the PCE by 6.5% (95% CI 5.5-7.5%, p&lt;0.001).

Conclusions and RelevanceGenomic and clinical risk factors for CAD display time-varying importance across the lifespan. The study underscores the added value of CAD PRS, particularly among individuals younger than 55 years, for enhancing early risk prediction and prevention strategies.

Key Points QuestionHow do genomic and clinical risk factors contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk across a broad age range?

FindingsThis longitudinal observational study across two cohorts found that both genomic and clinical risk factors exhibit age-dependent significance for CAD risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are most informative for individuals younger than 55 years, improving the predictive accuracy of current risk equations for these individuals.

MeaningThe study emphasizes the need to incorporate the dynamic effects of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly genomic risk, for more accurate early-life risk prediction and efficient CAD prevention strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogenic variants in kinesin KIF11 underlie microcephaly-lymphedema-chorioretinopathy (MLC) syndrome. Although well known for regulating spindle dynamics ensuring successful cell division, the association of KIF11 (encoding EG5) with development of the lymphatic system, and how KIF11 pathogenic variants lead to lymphatic dysfunction and lymphedema remain unknown.

Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, we demonstrate that MLC patients carrying pathogenic stop-gain variants in KIF11 have reduced mRNA and protein levels. Lymphoscintigraphy showed reduced tracer absorption, and intestinal lymphangiectasia was detected in one patient, pointing to impairment of lymphatic function caused by KIF11 haploinsufficiency.

We reveal that KIF11 is expressed in early human and mouse development with the lymphatic markers VEGFR3, Podoplanin and PROX1. In zebrafish, scRNA-seq identified KIF11 specifically expressed in endothelial precursors. In human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), EG5 inhibition with Ispinesib, reduces VEGFC-driven AKT phosphorylation, migration and spheroid sprouting. KIF11 knockdown reduces PROX1 and VEGFR3 expression, providing for the first time a link between KIF11 and drivers of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic identity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AI chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging as an important source of public-facing medical information. Generative models hold promise for producing tailored guidance at scale, which could advance health literacy and mitigate well-known disparities in the accessibility of health-protective information. In this study, we highlight an important limitation of basic approaches to AI-powered text simplification: when given a zero-shot or one-shot simplification prompt, GPT-4 often responds by omitting critical details. To address this limitation, we developed a new prompting strategy, which we term rubric prompting. Rubric prompts involve a combination of a zero-shot simplification prompt with brief reminders about important topics to address. Using rubric prompts, we generate recommendations about cardiovascular disease prevention that are more complete, more readable, and have lower syntactic complexity than baseline responses produced without prompt engineering. This analysis provides a blueprint for rigorous evaluation of AI model outputs in medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolomic platforms using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can now rapidly quantify many circulating metabolites which are potential biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPractice patterns and outcomes of protected left main (PLM) and unprotected left main (ULM) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as the differences between these types of PCI, are not well defined in real-world clinical practice.

MethodsData collected from all Veteran Affairs (VA) catheterization laboratories participating in the Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking Program between 2009 and 2019. The analysis included 4,351 patients undergoing left main PCI, of which 1,306 pairs of PLM and ULM PCI were included in a propensity matched cohort. Patients and procedural characteristics were compared between PLM and ULM PCI. Temporal trends were also assessed. Peri-procedural and one-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were compared using cumulative incidence plots. The primary outcome was MACE outcomes at 1-year, which was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, rehospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI), rehospitalization for stroke or urgent revascularization.

ResultsULM PCI patients in comparison to PLM PCI were older (71.5 vs 69.2; P &lt; 0.001), more clinically complex and more likely to present with ACS. In the propensity matched cohort, radial access was used more often for ULM PCI (21% [273] vs. 14% [185], P &lt; 0.001), and ULM PCI was more likely to involve the LM bifurcation (22% vs 14%; P = 0.003) and require mechanical circulatory support (10% [134] vs 1% [17]; P &lt;0.001). One-year MACE occurred more frequently with ULM PCI compared to PLM PCI (22% [289] vs. 16% [215]; P = &lt; 0.001) and all-cause mortality was also higher (16% [213] vs. 10% [125]; P = &lt; 0.001). In the matched cohort there was a low incidence of rehospitalization for MI (4% [48] ULM vs. 4% [48] PLM; P = 1.000) or revascularization (7% [94] ULM vs. 6% [84] PLM; P = 0.485).

ConclusionsVeterans undergoing PLM PCI had better one-year outcomes than those undergoing ULM PCI, but in both groups there was a high rate of mortality and MACE at one-year despite a relatively low rate of MI or revascularization.</p>
