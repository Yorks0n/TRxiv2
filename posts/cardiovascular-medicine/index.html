F.; Trebing, J.; Reich, C.; Haas, J.; Sedaghat-Hamedani, F.; Meder, B.; Dimmeler, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.16.22283442\nCardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.\nPowerAI-CVD - the first Chinese-specific, validated artificial intelligence-powered in-silico predictive model for cardiovascular disease\nAuthors: Li, L.; Chou, O. H. I.; Lu, L.; Pui, H. H. H.; Lee, Q.; Kaur, N.; Wong, W. T.; Chang, C.; Liu, H.; Wai, A. K. C.; Cheung, B. M. Y.; Liu, T.; Tse, G.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296722\nBackgroundThe main risk stratification tools for identifying high-risk individuals of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are based on Western populations. Few models are developed specifically for Asian populations and are not enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this study is to develop the first AI-powered quantitative predictive tool for CVD (PowerAI-CVD) incorporate physiological blood pressure measurements, existing diseases and medications, and laboratory tests from Chinese patients. MethodsThe study analysed patients who attended family medicine clinics between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke or cardiovascular mortality, with follow-up until 31st December 2019. The performance of AI-driven models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, AdaBoost, SVM-Sigmod) for predicting MACE was compared. Predicted probability (ranging between 0 and 1) of the best model (CatBoost) was used as the baseline in-silico marker to predict future MACE events during follow-up. ResultsA total of 154,569 patients were included. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) suffered from MACE (annualised risk: 1.28%). The machine learning in-silico marker captured MACE risk from established risk variables (sex, age, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, existing cardiovascular diseases, medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, antihypertensive drugs, and statins) and laboratory tests (NLR, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL)). MACE incidences increased quantitatively with ascending quartiles of the in-silico marker. The CatBoost model showed the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. The CatBoost model based in-silico marker shows significant prediction strength for future MACE events, across subgroups (age, sex, prior MACE, etc) and different follow-up durations. ConclusionsThe AI-powered risk prediction tool can accurately forecast incident CVD events, allowing personalised risk prediction at the individual level. A dashboard for predictive analytics was developed, allowing real-time dynamic updates of risk estimates from new data. It can be easily incorporated into routine clinical use to aid clinicians and healthcare administrators to identify high-risk patients.

L.; McCabe, J. J.; Brown, R.; Crow, Y. J.; Hunt, D.; Whiteley, W.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296935\nIntroduction: Type I interferons are cytokines involved in innate immunity against viruses. Genetic disorders of type I interferon regulation are associated with a range of autoimmune and cerebrovascular phenotypes. Carriers of pathogenic variants involved in genetic disorders of type I interferons are generally considered asymptomatic. Preliminary data suggests, however, that genetically determined dysregulation of type I interferon responses is associated with autoimmunity, and may also be relevant to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We aim to determine whether functional variants in genes involved in type I interferon regulation and signalling are associated with the risk of autoimmunity, stroke, and dementia in a population cohort. Methods and analysis: We will perform a hypothesis-driven candidate pathway association study of type I interferon-related genes using rare variants in the UK Biobank (UKB). We will manually curate type I interferon regulation and signalling genes from a literature review and Gene Ontology, followed by clinical and functional filtering. Variants of interest will be included based on pre-defined clinical relevance and functional annotations (using LOFTEE, M-CAP and a minor allele frequency \u003c0.1%). The association of variants with 15 clinical and three neuroradiological phenotypes will be assessed with a rare variant genetic risk score and gene-level tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold from the number of genetic units and phenotypes tested. We will explore the association of significant genetic units with 196 additional health-related outcomes to help interpret their relevance and explore the clinical spectrum of genetic perturbations of type I interferon. Ethics and dissemination: The UKB has received ethical approval from the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment. This research will be conducted using the UKB Resource under application number 93,160. We expect to disseminate our results in a peer-reviewed journal and at an international cardiovascular conference.\nCardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in a Prospective Multicenter Cohort of Older Adults: The Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA)\nAuthors: Wolf, C.; Blackwell, T. L.; Johnson, E.; Glynn, N. W.; Nicklas, B. J.; Kritchevsky, S. B.; Carnero, E. A.; Cawthon, P.; Cummings, S. C.; Toledo, F. G. S.; Newman, A. B.; Forman, D. E.; Goodpaster, B. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296120\nBACKGROUNDCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) has long been the criterion method to assess CRF, but its feasibility, efficacy and reliability in older adults is unclear. The large, multicenter Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) employed CPET to evaluate the mechanisms underlying declines in mobility with aging among community-dwelling older adults. Our primary objective was to design and implement a CPET protocol in older adults that was dependable, safe, scientifically valuable, and methodologically reliable. METHODSCPET was performed using treadmill exercise in 875 adults [\u0026ge;]70 years. A composite protocol included a symptom-limited peak exercise phase and two submaximal phases to assess cardiopulmonary ventilatory indices during 1) participants preferred walking speed and 2) at slow walking speed of 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s). An adjudication process was in place to review tests for validity if they met any prespecified criteria (VO2peak \u003c12.0 ml/kg/min; maximum heart rate (HR) \u003c100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio (RER) \u003c1.05 and a rating of perceived exertion \u003c15). A repeat test was performed in a subset (N=30) to assess reproducibility. RESULTSCPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to complete the VO2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a risk alert during any phase of testing and only two adverse events occurred during the peak phase: a fall and atrial fibrillation. The average {+/-} standard deviation for VO2peak was 20.2 {+/-} 4.8 mL/kg/min, peak HR 142 {+/-} 18 bpm, and peak RER 1.14 {+/-} 0.09. VO2peak and RER were slightly higher in men than women. Adjudication was indicated in 47 participants; 20 were evaluated as valid, 27 as invalid (18 had a data collection error, 9 did not reach VO2peak). Reproducibility of VO2peak was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97). CONCLUSIONSCPET was feasible, effective and safe for community-dwelling older adults, many of whom had multimorbidity and frailty. These data support a broader implementation of CPET to provide important insight into the role of CRF and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases. Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSPerforming cardiopulmonary exercise testing in a community dwelling older adult with multimorbidities or frailty is feasible and exceptionally safe under highly trained exercise physiologists and physician supervision. Reproducibility of VO2peak among community-dwelling older adults with significant clinical complexity was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97). The VO2peak observed was comparable to established normative data for older adults, and adds merit to the limited data collected on VO2peak norms in older adults. What Are the Clinical Implications?Ventilatory gas collection during clinical cardiac stress testing may be valuable to plan of care in routine management of older adults due to the important role of aerobic fitness on morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide insight into the role of cardiorespiratory fitness and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.\nPlatelet activation and platelet leukocyte aggregates are associated with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery\nAuthors: Brown, N.; Sullo, N.; Eagle-Hemminh, B.; Lai, F. Y.; Sheikh, S.; Tomkova, K.; Joel-David, L.; Aujla, H.; Kumar, T.; Goodall, A. H.; Murphy, G.; Wozniak, M. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296815\nWe hypothesised that circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) and micro-RNA levels can serve as predictive and diagnostic markers for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Plasma samples were collected from patients recruited to the MaRACAS study before, immediately after and 6-12, 24 and 48 hours after the procedure from 95 patients. Particle size distribution and concentrations were measured using NanoSight. EV derivation and platelet and leukocyte activation were measured using flow cytometry. Platelet function was measured with Multiplate, and circulating soluble biomarkers were measured with a MAGPIX device. Micro-RNA assessment was performed with TaqMan arrays in batched samples. Selected micro-RNAs were validated in each sample by qRT-PCR. Our data shows that platelet-derived EVs were higher 24 hours after surgery. TaqMan arrays identified miR-668 downregulated before and miR-92a-1, -920, -518a-3p, -133b and -1262 upregulated immediately after surgery in AKI patients. Validation confirmed that miR-1262 was significantly upregulated after surgery and identified miR-133b as downregulated before surgery. In addition, we showed that platelets were desensitised to ADP 6-12 hours after surgery. There were more platelet-granulocyte aggregates before and 24 hours after surgery, and levels of soluble ICAM1 were higher before surgery in patients with AKI. In conclusion, AKI is associated with platelet activation, suggesting that platelet inhibition treatments may be renoprotective. Furthermore, studies in larger cohorts should verify miR-1262 as a diagnostic marker of AKI.\nPredictive value of Serum CCL21 and CCL19 levels in heart failure patients: A prospective study\nAuthors: Zeng, W.; Li, L.; Wang, L.; Lin, B.; Lin, K.; Yu, P.; Yu, H.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296854\nBackground: Chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)21 and CCL19 are well-recognized to associate with adverse events of cardiovascular disease, especially long-term prognosis. However, few studies have reported its correlation with heart failure. Purpose: To investigate and compare the predictive value of CCL21 and CCL19 serum levels in patients with heart failure. Methods: In this prospective, observational, single-center study, 221 patients with heart failure and 55 healthy controls were included. ROC curves were generated to analyze and compare the serum levels of CCL21 and CCL19 in predicting all-cause mortality and composite events. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for prognosis. Pearson correlation was used to measure the correlation between creatinine and CCL21 / CCL19 levels. Results: The study observed 108 events (30 deaths and 78 occurred composite endpoints) over a median follow-up of 494.5(231.5,950.0) days. CCL21 showed strong predictive value for both all-cause mortality (P=0.001) and composite endpoints (P \u003c0.001). while the combination of CCL21 and NT-proBNP further improved the predictive power, respectively (both P\u003c0.001). K-M survival analysis revealed that patients with increased CCL21 and CCL19 exhibited higher all-cause mortality (both P\u003c0.05). Meanwhile, higher incidence of composite endpoint events was also observed in patients with elevated CCL21 (P\u003c0.05). Importantly, multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated that smoking, higher level of CCL21 and ischemic heart disease were independent risk factors for all-cause mortality (P\u003c0.001). Furthermore, diabetes and elevation of CCL21 were associated with an increased risk of composite endpoints (P\u003c0.001). On the other hand, changes in CCL19 levels showed a graded association with worse renal function, resulting in a slight increasing trend in G3 and G4/5, (overall interaction P\u003c0.05), with higher concentrations in G3 and G4/5(overall interaction P\u003c0.05). Conclusions: Serum concentrations of CCL21 and CCL19 were significantly elevated in heart failure patients. High level of CCL21 is an independent risk factor for the adverse events in heart failure and may complement the prediction of those events which are less affected by renal function.\nTime-Dependent ECG-AI Prediction of Fatal Coronary Heart Disease\nAuthors: Butler, L.; Ivanov, A.; Celik, T.; Karabayir, I.; Chinthala, L.; Tootooni, M. S.; Jaeger, B.; Doerr, A.; McManus, D. D.; Davis, R. L.; Herrington, D. M.; Akbilgic, O.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296910\nBackground Sudden cardiac death (SCD) affects \u003e4 million people globally, and ~300,000 yearly in the US. Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is used as a proxy to SCD when coronary disease is present and no other causes of death can be identified. Electrocardiographic (ECG) artificial intelligence (AI) models (ECG-AI) show promise in predicting adverse coronary events yet their application to FCHD is limited. Objectives This research aimed to develop accurate ECG-AI models to predict risk for FCHD within the general population using waveform 12- and single-lead ECG data as well as assess time-dependent risk. Methods Standard 10-second 12-lead ECGs sampled at 250Hz, demographic and clinical data from University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) were used to develop and validate models. Eight models were developed and tested: two classification models with convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 12- and single-lead ECGs as inputs (12-ECG-AI and 1-ECG-AI, respectively) and six time-dependent cox proportional hazard regression (CPHR) models using demographics, clinical data and ECG-AI outputs. The dataset was split into 80% for model derivation, with five-fold cross-validation, and 20% holdout test set. Models were evaluated using the AUC and C-Index. Correlation of predicted risks from the 12-lead (12-ECG-AI) and single-lead (1-ECG-AI) CNN models was assessed. Results A total of 50,132 patients were included in this study (29,093 controls and 21,039 cases) with a total of 167,662 ECGs with mean age of 62.50{+/-}14.80years, 53.4% males and 48.5% African-Americans. The 12- and 1-ECG-AI models resulted AUCs=0.77 and 0.76, respectively on the holdout data. The best performing model was C12-ECG-AI-Cox (demographics+clinical+ECG) with no time restriction AUC=0.85(0.84-0.86) and C-Index= 0.78(0.77-0.79). 2-year FCHD risk prediction reached AUC=0.91(0.90-0.92). The 12-/1-ECG-AI models' predictions were highly correlated (R2 = 0.72). Conclusion 2-year risk for FCHD can be predicted with moderate accuracy from ECG data alone. When combined with other data, a very high accuracy was obtained. High correlation between single-lead and 12-lead ECG models infer opportunities for screening larger patient populations for FCHD risk.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac homeostasis relies on the appropriate provision of nutrients to the working myocardium. EPHB4 is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity and correct fatty acid transport uptake in the heart via regulating the caveolar trafficking of the fatty acid receptor CD36. In the mouse, endothelial specific loss-of-function of the receptor EphB4, or its ligand ephrin-B2, induces Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) like defects. Now, we have identified six new EPHB4 variants with deleterious potential in a cohort of 573 DCM patients. Similar to the EphB4 mutant mice, EPHB4 variants carrying patients show an altered expression pattern of CD36 and CAV1 in the heart. For the first time, our data identifies EPHB4 mutations in DCM patients. This observation supports the notion that the Eph-ephrin signalling pathway, and in particular the receptor EPHB4, plays a role in the development of DCM in human patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe main risk stratification tools for identifying high-risk individuals of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are based on Western populations. Few models are developed specifically for Asian populations and are not enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this study is to develop the first AI-powered quantitative predictive tool for CVD (PowerAI-CVD) incorporate physiological blood pressure measurements, existing diseases and medications, and laboratory tests from Chinese patients.

MethodsThe study analysed patients who attended family medicine clinics between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke or cardiovascular mortality, with follow-up until 31st December 2019. The performance of AI-driven models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, AdaBoost, SVM-Sigmod) for predicting MACE was compared. Predicted probability (ranging between 0 and 1) of the best model (CatBoost) was used as the baseline in-silico marker to predict future MACE events during follow-up.

ResultsA total of 154,569 patients were included. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) suffered from MACE (annualised risk: 1.28%). The machine learning in-silico marker captured MACE risk from established risk variables (sex, age, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, existing cardiovascular diseases, medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, antihypertensive drugs, and statins) and laboratory tests (NLR, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL)). MACE incidences increased quantitatively with ascending quartiles of the in-silico marker. The CatBoost model showed the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. The CatBoost model based in-silico marker shows significant prediction strength for future MACE events, across subgroups (age, sex, prior MACE, etc) and different follow-up durations.

ConclusionsThe AI-powered risk prediction tool can accurately forecast incident CVD events, allowing personalised risk prediction at the individual level. A dashboard for predictive analytics was developed, allowing real-time dynamic updates of risk estimates from new data. It can be easily incorporated into routine clinical use to aid clinicians and healthcare administrators to identify high-risk patients.

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Type I interferons are cytokines involved in innate immunity against viruses. Genetic disorders of type I interferon regulation are associated with a range of autoimmune and cerebrovascular phenotypes. Carriers of pathogenic variants involved in genetic disorders of type I interferons are generally considered asymptomatic. Preliminary data suggests, however, that genetically determined dysregulation of type I interferon responses is associated with autoimmunity, and may also be relevant to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We aim to determine whether functional variants in genes involved in type I interferon regulation and signalling are associated with the risk of autoimmunity, stroke, and dementia in a population cohort. Methods and analysis: We will perform a hypothesis-driven candidate pathway association study of type I interferon-related genes using rare variants in the UK Biobank (UKB). We will manually curate type I interferon regulation and signalling genes from a literature review and Gene Ontology, followed by clinical and functional filtering. Variants of interest will be included based on pre-defined clinical relevance and functional annotations (using LOFTEE, M-CAP and a minor allele frequency &lt;0.1%). The association of variants with 15 clinical and three neuroradiological phenotypes will be assessed with a rare variant genetic risk score and gene-level tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold from the number of genetic units and phenotypes tested. We will explore the association of significant genetic units with 196 additional health-related outcomes to help interpret their relevance and explore the clinical spectrum of genetic perturbations of type I interferon. Ethics and dissemination: The UKB has received ethical approval from the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment. This research will be conducted using the UKB Resource under application number 93,160. We expect to disseminate our results in a peer-reviewed journal and at an international cardiovascular conference.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) has long been the criterion method to assess CRF, but its feasibility, efficacy and reliability in older adults is unclear. The large, multicenter Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) employed CPET to evaluate the mechanisms underlying declines in mobility with aging among community-dwelling older adults. Our primary objective was to design and implement a CPET protocol in older adults that was dependable, safe, scientifically valuable, and methodologically reliable.

METHODSCPET was performed using treadmill exercise in 875 adults [&amp;ge;]70 years. A composite protocol included a symptom-limited peak exercise phase and two submaximal phases to assess cardiopulmonary ventilatory indices during 1) participants preferred walking speed and 2) at slow walking speed of 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s). An adjudication process was in place to review tests for validity if they met any prespecified criteria (VO2peak &lt;12.0 ml/kg/min; maximum heart rate (HR) &lt;100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio (RER) &lt;1.05 and a rating of perceived exertion &lt;15). A repeat test was performed in a subset (N=30) to assess reproducibility.

RESULTSCPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to complete the VO2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a risk alert during any phase of testing and only two adverse events occurred during the peak phase: a fall and atrial fibrillation. The average {&#43;/-} standard deviation for VO2peak was 20.2 {&#43;/-} 4.8 mL/kg/min, peak HR 142 {&#43;/-} 18 bpm, and peak RER 1.14 {&#43;/-} 0.09. VO2peak and RER were slightly higher in men than women. Adjudication was indicated in 47 participants; 20 were evaluated as valid, 27 as invalid (18 had a data collection error, 9 did not reach VO2peak). Reproducibility of VO2peak was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97).

CONCLUSIONSCPET was feasible, effective and safe for community-dwelling older adults, many of whom had multimorbidity and frailty. These data support a broader implementation of CPET to provide important insight into the role of CRF and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSPerforming cardiopulmonary exercise testing in a community dwelling older adult with multimorbidities or frailty is feasible and exceptionally safe under highly trained exercise physiologists and physician supervision.
Reproducibility of VO2peak among community-dwelling older adults with significant clinical complexity was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97).
The VO2peak observed was comparable to established normative data for older adults, and adds merit to the limited data collected on VO2peak norms in older adults.


What Are the Clinical Implications?Ventilatory gas collection during clinical cardiac stress testing may be valuable to plan of care in routine management of older adults due to the important role of aerobic fitness on morbidity and mortality.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide insight into the role of cardiorespiratory fitness and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We hypothesised that circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) and micro-RNA levels can serve as predictive and diagnostic markers for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Plasma samples were collected from patients recruited to the MaRACAS study before, immediately after and 6-12, 24 and 48 hours after the procedure from 95 patients. Particle size distribution and concentrations were measured using NanoSight. EV derivation and platelet and leukocyte activation were measured using flow cytometry. Platelet function was measured with Multiplate, and circulating soluble biomarkers were measured with a MAGPIX device. Micro-RNA assessment was performed with TaqMan arrays in batched samples. Selected micro-RNAs were validated in each sample by qRT-PCR. Our data shows that platelet-derived EVs were higher 24 hours after surgery. TaqMan arrays identified miR-668 downregulated before and miR-92a-1, -920, -518a-3p, -133b and -1262 upregulated immediately after surgery in AKI patients. Validation confirmed that miR-1262 was significantly upregulated after surgery and identified miR-133b as downregulated before surgery. In addition, we showed that platelets were desensitised to ADP 6-12 hours after surgery. There were more platelet-granulocyte aggregates before and 24 hours after surgery, and levels of soluble ICAM1 were higher before surgery in patients with AKI. In conclusion, AKI is associated with platelet activation, suggesting that platelet inhibition treatments may be renoprotective. Furthermore, studies in larger cohorts should verify miR-1262 as a diagnostic marker of AKI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)21 and CCL19 are well-recognized to associate with adverse events of cardiovascular disease, especially long-term prognosis. However, few studies have reported its correlation with heart failure. Purpose: To investigate and compare the predictive value of CCL21 and CCL19 serum levels in patients with heart failure. Methods: In this prospective, observational, single-center study, 221 patients with heart failure and 55 healthy controls were included. ROC curves were generated to analyze and compare the serum levels of CCL21 and CCL19 in predicting all-cause mortality and composite events. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for prognosis. Pearson correlation was used to measure the correlation between creatinine and CCL21 / CCL19 levels. Results: The study observed 108 events (30 deaths and 78 occurred composite endpoints) over a median follow-up of 494.5(231.5,950.0) days. CCL21 showed strong predictive value for both all-cause mortality (P=0.001) and composite endpoints (P &lt;0.001). while the combination of CCL21 and NT-proBNP further improved the predictive power, respectively (both P&lt;0.001). K-M survival analysis revealed that patients with increased CCL21 and CCL19 exhibited higher all-cause mortality (both P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, higher incidence of composite endpoint events was also observed in patients with elevated CCL21 (P&lt;0.05). Importantly, multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated that smoking, higher level of CCL21 and ischemic heart disease were independent risk factors for all-cause mortality (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, diabetes and elevation of CCL21 were associated with an increased risk of composite endpoints (P&lt;0.001). On the other hand, changes in CCL19 levels showed a graded association with worse renal function, resulting in a slight increasing trend in G3 and G4/5, (overall interaction P&lt;0.05), with higher concentrations in G3 and G4/5(overall interaction P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Serum concentrations of CCL21 and CCL19 were significantly elevated in heart failure patients. High level of CCL21 is an independent risk factor for the adverse events in heart failure and may complement the prediction of those events which are less affected by renal function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Sudden cardiac death (SCD) affects &gt;4 million people globally, and ~300,000 yearly in the US. Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is used as a proxy to SCD when coronary disease is present and no other causes of death can be identified. Electrocardiographic (ECG) artificial intelligence (AI) models (ECG-AI) show promise in predicting adverse coronary events yet their application to FCHD is limited. Objectives This research aimed to develop accurate ECG-AI models to predict risk for FCHD within the general population using waveform 12- and single-lead ECG data as well as assess time-dependent risk. Methods Standard 10-second 12-lead ECGs sampled at 250Hz, demographic and clinical data from University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) were used to develop and validate models. Eight models were developed and tested: two classification models with convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 12- and single-lead ECGs as inputs (12-ECG-AI and 1-ECG-AI, respectively) and six time-dependent cox proportional hazard regression (CPHR) models using demographics, clinical data and ECG-AI outputs. The dataset was split into 80% for model derivation, with five-fold cross-validation, and 20% holdout test set. Models were evaluated using the AUC and C-Index. Correlation of predicted risks from the 12-lead (12-ECG-AI) and single-lead (1-ECG-AI) CNN models was assessed. Results A total of 50,132 patients were included in this study (29,093 controls and 21,039 cases) with a total of 167,662 ECGs with mean age of 62.50{&#43;/-}14.80years, 53.4% males and 48.5% African-Americans. The 12- and 1-ECG-AI models resulted AUCs=0.77 and 0.76, respectively on the holdout data. The best performing model was C12-ECG-AI-Cox (demographics&#43;clinical&#43;ECG) with no time restriction AUC=0.85(0.84-0.86) and C-Index= 0.78(0.77-0.79). 2-year FCHD risk prediction reached AUC=0.91(0.90-0.92). The 12-/1-ECG-AI models&#39; predictions were highly correlated (R2 = 0.72). Conclusion 2-year risk for FCHD can be predicted with moderate accuracy from ECG data alone. When combined with other data, a very high accuracy was obtained. High correlation between single-lead and 12-lead ECG models infer opportunities for screening larger patient populations for FCHD risk.</p>
