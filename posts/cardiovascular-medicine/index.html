Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P\u003c8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.\nDivergent trends in the incidence and mortality of coronary events, especially in women. Evidence from Finland in 1996-2021.\nAuthors: Kallstrom, A.; Holopainen, I.; Kambur, O.; Perola, M.; Salomaa, V.; Havulinna, A. S.; Ramste, M.; Sinisalo, J.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.23299126\nObjectiveAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) incidence and case fatality (CF) have declined in the past decades, but some studies have suggested a potential stagnation in this decline. We examined how the ACS burden has evolved among persons aged 35-74 in Finland from 1996 to 2021. MethodsWe used Finnish country-wide Hospital Discharge- and Causes of Death-Registers covering first non-fatal and fatal ACS events, totaling 69 906 442 person-years at risk. We analyzed incidence, mortality, and 28-day CF, and their trends using negative binomial, Poisson, segmented, and logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. ResultsAltogether, the analysis consisted of 186 489 non-fatal and 72 907 fatal ACS events. ACS incidence declined in men (annual percentage change (APC) -2.0% [95% CI -2.2 to -1.8]) and in older women (APC of 55-64 year old -1.5% [-1.7 to -1.2] and 65-74 year old -3.3% [-3.4 to -3.2]), but the incidence decline slowed down over the last decade. In younger women aged 35-54, incidence was unchanged during the study period. ACS mortality and CF declined (APC of the mortality in men - 4.4% [-4.6 to -4.2] and in women -5.0% [-5.2 to -4.7]. APC of CF in men -2.7% [-2.8 to -2.6] and in women -3.3% [-3.6 to -3.1]). ConclusionsACS mortality declined in all groups, but the decline in ACS incidence slowed down and even halted in women. In women aged 35-54, the incidence was unchanged during the study period. These results emphasize the need of intensified cardiovascular prevention, particularly in women. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSDuring the last decades coronary artery disease treatment and prevention have improved worldwide which has led to a decline in ACS mortality and case fatality. However, recent studies from several countries suggest, that incidence decline has stagnated or even turned to increase, especially in younger age cohorts. What this study addsThis study showed that incidence has ceased its decline in women aged 35-54 and has slowed down in older age groups. Together with declining mortality this results in a growing number of patients living with cardiovascular disease leading to increased healthcare costs. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe alarming results of this study underline the importance of intensifying prevention, focusing especially on young and middle-aged women.\nThe relationship between low levels of albuminuria and cardiovascular mortality among apparently healthy adults\nAuthors: Claudel, S. E.; Waikar, S.; Schmidt, I. M.; Vasan, R. S.; Verma, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300378\nBackground: Albuminuria is associated with cardiovascular events among adults with underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes, even at low levels of urinary albumin excretion. We hypothesized that low levels of albuminuria in the normal range (urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR) \u003c30 mg/g) are associated with cardiovascular death among apparently healthy adults. Methods: We studied adults who participated in the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We excluded participants with baseline cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u003c60ml/min/1.73m2, those who were currently pregnant, and those who had received dialysis in the last year. After excluding these conditions, only 5.0% of the remaining population had UACR \u003e=30 mg/g (N=873) and were excluded. The final sample size was 16,247. We assessed the relationship between UACR and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, health insurance, food insecurity, serum albumin, body mass index, use of statins, and eGFR. Results: Mean age was 38.9 years (SD 13.6) and 53.7% were women. The median length of follow-up was 12.2 years. In multivariable-adjusted models, each doubling of UACR (within the \u003c30 mg/g range) was associated with a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.65)] and a 28% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.28 (95%CI 1.17-1.41)]. The highest tertile of UACR (7.1-29.9 mg/g) was associated with an 87% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.87 (95%CI 1.20-2.92)] and 59% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.59 (95%CI 1.28-1.96)], compared with the lowest tertile (\u003c 4.3 mg/g). Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample of relatively healthy community-dwelling adults, higher levels of albuminuria in the conventionally normal range \u003c30 mg/g in healthy individuals are associated with greater mortality. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the existence of a risk gradient across all levels of albuminuria, even in the so-called normal range.\nMechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in Long COVID: an accumulation of multi-system dysfunction\nAuthors: Jamieson, A.; Al Saikhan, L.; Alghamdi, L.; Hamill Howes, L.; Purcell, H.; Hillman, T.; Heightman, M. J.; Treibel, T. A.; Orini, M.; Bell, R. M.; Scully, M.; Hamer, M.; Chaturvedi, N.; Hughes, A.; Astin, R.; Jones, S.\nScore: 37.2, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23299429\nThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood. Cases were recruited from a Long COVID clinic (N=32; 44{+/-}12y; 10(31%)men), and age/sex- matched healthy controls (HC) (N=19; 40{+/-}13y; 6(32%)men) from University College London staff and students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups using potential outcome means(95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values. When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (1847(1679,2016) vs (2176(1978,2373) ml/min, p=0.002) and Anaerobic Threshold (13.2(12.2,14.3) vs 15.6(14.4,17.2) ml/Kg/min, p\u003c0.001), and lower oxidative capacity on near infrared spectroscopy ({tau}: 38.7(31.9,45.6) vs 24.6(19.1,30.1) seconds, p=0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%. Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation in a significant proportion. These multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers. Key PointsO_LIThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood. C_LIO_LIWe show that Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance in line with previous work. C_LIO_LIIn Long COVID cases, we observed reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. C_LIO_LIWe also observed evidence of attendant autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation in a significant proportion of Long COVID cases. C_LIO_LIThese multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) incidence and case fatality (CF) have declined in the past decades, but some studies have suggested a potential stagnation in this decline. We examined how the ACS burden has evolved among persons aged 35-74 in Finland from 1996 to 2021.

MethodsWe used Finnish country-wide Hospital Discharge- and Causes of Death-Registers covering first non-fatal and fatal ACS events, totaling 69 906 442 person-years at risk. We analyzed incidence, mortality, and 28-day CF, and their trends using negative binomial, Poisson, segmented, and logistic regression adjusting for age and sex.

ResultsAltogether, the analysis consisted of 186 489 non-fatal and 72 907 fatal ACS events. ACS incidence declined in men (annual percentage change (APC) -2.0% [95% CI -2.2 to -1.8]) and in older women (APC of 55-64 year old -1.5% [-1.7 to -1.2] and 65-74 year old -3.3% [-3.4 to -3.2]), but the incidence decline slowed down over the last decade. In younger women aged 35-54, incidence was unchanged during the study period. ACS mortality and CF declined (APC of the mortality in men - 4.4% [-4.6 to -4.2] and in women -5.0% [-5.2 to -4.7]. APC of CF in men -2.7% [-2.8 to -2.6] and in women -3.3% [-3.6 to -3.1]).

ConclusionsACS mortality declined in all groups, but the decline in ACS incidence slowed down and even halted in women. In women aged 35-54, the incidence was unchanged during the study period. These results emphasize the need of intensified cardiovascular prevention, particularly in women.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSDuring the last decades coronary artery disease treatment and prevention have improved worldwide which has led to a decline in ACS mortality and case fatality. However, recent studies from several countries suggest, that incidence decline has stagnated or even turned to increase, especially in younger age cohorts.

What this study addsThis study showed that incidence has ceased its decline in women aged 35-54 and has slowed down in older age groups. Together with declining mortality this results in a growing number of patients living with cardiovascular disease leading to increased healthcare costs.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe alarming results of this study underline the importance of intensifying prevention, focusing especially on young and middle-aged women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Albuminuria is associated with cardiovascular events among adults with underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes, even at low levels of urinary albumin excretion. We hypothesized that low levels of albuminuria in the normal range (urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR) &lt;30 mg/g) are associated with cardiovascular death among apparently healthy adults. Methods: We studied adults who participated in the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We excluded participants with baseline cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60ml/min/1.73m2, those who were currently pregnant, and those who had received dialysis in the last year. After excluding these conditions, only 5.0% of the remaining population had UACR &gt;=30 mg/g (N=873) and were excluded. The final sample size was 16,247. We assessed the relationship between UACR and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, health insurance, food insecurity, serum albumin, body mass index, use of statins, and eGFR. Results: Mean age was 38.9 years (SD 13.6) and 53.7% were women. The median length of follow-up was 12.2 years. In multivariable-adjusted models, each doubling of UACR (within the &lt;30 mg/g range) was associated with a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.65)] and a 28% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.28 (95%CI 1.17-1.41)]. The highest tertile of UACR (7.1-29.9 mg/g) was associated with an 87% higher risk of cardiovascular death [HR 1.87 (95%CI 1.20-2.92)] and 59% higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR 1.59 (95%CI 1.28-1.96)], compared with the lowest tertile (&lt; 4.3 mg/g). Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample of relatively healthy community-dwelling adults, higher levels of albuminuria in the conventionally normal range &lt;30 mg/g in healthy individuals are associated with greater mortality. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the existence of a risk gradient across all levels of albuminuria, even in the so-called normal range.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood.

Cases were recruited from a Long COVID clinic (N=32; 44{&#43;/-}12y; 10(31%)men), and age/sex- matched healthy controls (HC) (N=19; 40{&#43;/-}13y; 6(32%)men) from University College London staff and students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups using potential outcome means(95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values.

When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (1847(1679,2016) vs (2176(1978,2373) ml/min, p=0.002) and Anaerobic Threshold (13.2(12.2,14.3) vs 15.6(14.4,17.2) ml/Kg/min, p&lt;0.001), and lower oxidative capacity on near infrared spectroscopy ({tau}: 38.7(31.9,45.6) vs 24.6(19.1,30.1) seconds, p=0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%.

Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation in a significant proportion. These multi-system factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in Long COVID sufferers.

Key PointsO_LIThe pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Long COVID) is not fully understood.
C_LIO_LIWe show that Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance in line with previous work.
C_LIO_LIIn Long COVID cases, we observed reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology.
C_LIO_LIWe also observed evidence of attendant autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation in a significant proportion of Long COVID cases.
