MethodsComprehensive details, encompassing the first authors name, publication year, sample inclusion criteria, sample size, and demographic characteristics, including age and gender of participants, were systematically extracted from all incorporated studies. Meanwhile, the analysis encompassed the assessment of the risk associated with nineteen cardiovascular outcomes. ResultsA total of 3, 201 potentially eligible studies were initially identified for consideration. Following rigorous literature screening and quality control measures, eighteen studies, encompassing 46, 083, 975 patients, met the specified criteria. In comparison to the control cohort, our investigation unveiled a heightened risk of 19 cardiovascular outcomes associated with long COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55-1.81) (I2 = 69.1%, p= 0.000) for the overall risk of cardiovascular outcomes, indicating an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals affected by long COVID-19. While the heterogeneity was relatively high, it is essential to acknowledge that all studies inherently carry an unavoidable risk of bias, irrespective of their quality rating. Moreover, there appears to be no significant publication bias based on the funnel plot, Beggs, and Eggers tests. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal substantial alterations in the overall stability of the results. ConclusionsOur meta-analysis substantiates that individuals afflicted with long COVID-19 face an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Routine assessment of cardiac function is deemed essential for a long COVID-19 high-risk cardiovascular disease population. Timely interventions have the potential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated mortality in this population.

C.; Fu, M. K.; Dempsey, W. P.; Abu-Mostafa, Y.; Rajagopal, A.; Rajagopal, A. B.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300502\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing methods for continuous, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring suffer from poor accuracy, uncomfortable form factors, or a need for frequent calibration, limiting their adoption. We introduce a new framework for continuous BP measurement that is noninvasive and calibration-free. The method uses acoustic stimulation to induce resonance of the artery wall. Ultrasound imaging is used to measure resonance and capture arterial dimensions which are related to blood pressure via a fully-determined physical model. The approach and model are validated in vitro using arterial mock-ups and then in multiple arteries in human subjects. Further development could facilitate more robust continuous blood pressure measurement, providing significant benefits for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.\nRiluzole is Associated With Reduced Risk of Heart Failure\nAuthors: KIM, K.; Kim, S.; Katana, M.; Terentyev, D.; Radwanski, P. B.; Munger, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300552\nBackground: Reduction of intracellular Na+ accumulation through late Na+ current inhibition has been recognized as a target for cardiac Ca2+ handling which underlies myocardial contractility and relaxation in heart failure (HF). Riluzole, a Na+ channel blocker with enhancement of Ca2+ activated K+ channel function, used for management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is effective in suppressing Ca2+ leak and therefore may improve cardiac function. Objectives: The study aim was to investigate whether riluzole lowers HF incidence. Methods: Rates of HF incident were compared using a commercial insurance and Medicare supplement claims databases. Patients with a filled riluzole prescription (treatment) between 06/2009 and 12/2019 were compared to those with no riluzole (control). We excluded HF patients during the 180 day baseline period. Study endpoint was the first HF diagnosis from the index riluzole prescription or ALS diagnosis. HF onset was compared between the propensity score matched treatment and control cohorts. Results: The matched cohort consisted of 4,060 pairs of riluzole/control patients. The 24 month cumulative incidence of HF onset for riluzole vs. control patients was 4.96% vs. 7.27%, calculating hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI, p value] of 0.55 [0.40 to 0.76, p\u003c0.01]. The HR estimates favoring riluzole over the ALS control were consistent across the 3 months to 2 year follow up. The clinically and statistically significant effect on HF onset was driven by the lower rate of HFrEF with the 2 year HR [95% CI] of 0.46 [0.21 to 0.99]. Conclusions: Riluzole is associated with a lower rate of HF onset, suggesting a potential prevention strategy for early management.\nIntegrative proteomic analyses across common cardiac diseases yield new mechanistic insights and enhanced prediction\nAuthors: Schuermans, A.; Pournamdari, A. B.; Lee, J.; Bhukar, R.; Ganesh, S.; Darosa, N.; Small, A. M.; Yu, Z.; Hornsby, W.; Koyama, S.; Januzzi, J. L.; Honigberg, M. C.; Natarajan, P.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300218\nCardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P\u003c8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.\nLeft ventricular trabecular layer operates at high ejection fraction: implications for pump function assessment in excessive trabeculation\nAuthors: Visoiu, I. S.; Rimbas, R. C.; Nicula, A. I.; Vinereanu, D.; Jensen, B.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300719\nAimsNumerous diagnostic criteria for excessive trabeculation (ET), or so-called \"noncompaction\", score the extent of the trabecular layer, yet whether the trabeculations themselves have a negative or positive impact on pump function is largely unknown. This study aimed to measure the ejection fraction (EF) of the trabecular layer and its impact on pump function assessment. Methods and resultsWe retrospectively analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in patients with ET of the left ventricle (LV). The LV was labelled into four regions: compact wall, central cavity (CC), trabeculations, and intertrabecular recesses (IR). For each label we calculated the systolic fractional volume change (SFVC) in short-axis images (n=15) and systolic fractional area change (SFAC) in 4-chamber images (n=30), by dividing end-systolic to end-diastolic values. We measured the EF of IR, CC, and total cavity (TC). Three methods to calculate EF of the TC were compared: trabeculations included (per guidelines), IR excluded (Jacquier criterion), trabeculations contoured and excluded (contour-EF). The SFVC and SFAC of the compact wall were similar with SFVC and SFAC of trabeculations (both P\u003e0.05). In contrast, the IR were more diminished in systole by comparison with the CC, having lower SFVC (39{+/-}17% vs. 56{+/-}16%, P\u003c0.001) and SFAC (37{+/-}22% vs. 72{+/-}12%, P\u003c0.001). EF of the IR was also greater than EF of the CC (61{+/-}17% vs. 44{+/-}16%, P\u003c0.001). Excluding IR from the TC or including trabeculations underestimates the contour-EF (44{+/-}16% and 40{+/-}12%, respectively, vs. 51{+/-}16%; both P\u003c0.001). ConclusionsThe trabecular layer has a high EF. Values of key prognostic indicators are better when this is accounted for.

MethodsIn the Mendelian randomization (MR) research, we extracted instrumental variants significantly correlated with PAT to assess its effects on CVDs. Inverse-variance weighted model was elected as the leading MR analytical method. F-statistic was utilized to assess the intensity of instrumental variants and avert weak-tool bias. Numerous sensitivity analyses were adopted to confirm the credibility of outcomes. The mediated effect of hypertension between PAT and CVDs was estimated in 2-step MR analysis. ResultsThe MR research demonstrated genetically determined PAT was remarkably correlated with greater risks of cardiovascular disease (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09--1.22, P=1.32*10-6), heart failure (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.28--5.34, P=0.008), coronary heart disease (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.55--8.06, P=0.003), ischemic heart disease (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.14--4.67, P=0.020), ischemic stroke (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.63--6.20, P=0.001), and venous thromboembolism (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00--1.04, P=0.015). And the correlation was partially mediated by hypertension. Results were verified by sensitivity analysis. ConclusionsGenetic determined PAT was remarkably correlated with additional risks of diverse CVDs. Identified as a mediator, hypertension had a significant influence on the causal association. The correlation between PAT and CVDs deserves further exploration. NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE What Is New?This was the first Mendelian randomization research to detect the potential causal relationship of genetically determined PTA on multiple CVDs risks and confirm the mediating effect of hypertension on the causal association. What Is Relevant?The MR research not only estimated the causal effect of PAT on hypertension but also identified the mediating role of hypertension between PAT and CVDs. Clinical/Pathophysiological Implications?This study revealed PAT promoted CVDs progression and hypertension played an intermediary role, which indicated that PAT might serve as a potential therapeutic target and antihypertensive drugs could be conjunctly used to provide cardiovascular benefits. especially for people with obesity, because they had more PAT accumulation.\n",

Meanwhile, the analysis encompassed the assessment of the risk associated with nineteen cardiovascular outcomes.

ResultsA total of 3, 201 potentially eligible studies were initially identified for consideration. Following rigorous literature screening and quality control measures, eighteen studies, encompassing 46, 083, 975 patients, met the specified criteria. In comparison to the control cohort, our investigation unveiled a heightened risk of 19 cardiovascular outcomes associated with long COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55-1.81) (I2 = 69.1%, p= 0.000) for the overall risk of cardiovascular outcomes, indicating an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals affected by long COVID-19. While the heterogeneity was relatively high, it is essential to acknowledge that all studies inherently carry an unavoidable risk of bias, irrespective of their quality rating. Moreover, there appears to be no significant publication bias based on the funnel plot, Beggs, and Eggers tests. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal substantial alterations in the overall stability of the results.

ConclusionsOur meta-analysis substantiates that individuals afflicted with long COVID-19 face an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Routine assessment of cardiac function is deemed essential for a long COVID-19 high-risk cardiovascular disease population. Timely interventions have the potential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated mortality in this population.

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing methods for continuous, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring suffer from poor accuracy, uncomfortable form factors, or a need for frequent calibration, limiting their adoption. We introduce a new framework for continuous BP measurement that is noninvasive and calibration-free. The method uses acoustic stimulation to induce resonance of the artery wall. Ultrasound imaging is used to measure resonance and capture arterial dimensions which are related to blood pressure via a fully-determined physical model. The approach and model are validated in vitro using arterial mock-ups and then in multiple arteries in human subjects. Further development could facilitate more robust continuous blood pressure measurement, providing significant benefits for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Reduction of intracellular Na&#43; accumulation through late Na&#43; current inhibition has been recognized as a target for cardiac Ca2&#43; handling which underlies myocardial contractility and relaxation in heart failure (HF). Riluzole, a Na&#43; channel blocker with enhancement of Ca2&#43; activated K&#43; channel function, used for management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is effective in suppressing Ca2&#43; leak and therefore may improve cardiac function. Objectives: The study aim was to investigate whether riluzole lowers HF incidence. Methods: Rates of HF incident were compared using a commercial insurance and Medicare supplement claims databases. Patients with a filled riluzole prescription (treatment) between 06/2009 and 12/2019 were compared to those with no riluzole (control). We excluded HF patients during the 180 day baseline period. Study endpoint was the first HF diagnosis from the index riluzole prescription or ALS diagnosis. HF onset was compared between the propensity score matched treatment and control cohorts. Results: The matched cohort consisted of 4,060 pairs of riluzole/control patients. The 24 month cumulative incidence of HF onset for riluzole vs. control patients was 4.96% vs. 7.27%, calculating hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI, p value] of 0.55 [0.40 to 0.76, p&lt;0.01]. The HR estimates favoring riluzole over the ALS control were consistent across the 3 months to 2 year follow up. The clinically and statistically significant effect on HF onset was driven by the lower rate of HFrEF with the 2 year HR [95% CI] of 0.46 [0.21 to 0.99]. Conclusions: Riluzole is associated with a lower rate of HF onset, suggesting a potential prevention strategy for early management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P&lt;8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimsNumerous diagnostic criteria for excessive trabeculation (ET), or so-called &#34;noncompaction&#34;, score the extent of the trabecular layer, yet whether the trabeculations themselves have a negative or positive impact on pump function is largely unknown. This study aimed to measure the ejection fraction (EF) of the trabecular layer and its impact on pump function assessment.

Methods and resultsWe retrospectively analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in patients with ET of the left ventricle (LV). The LV was labelled into four regions: compact wall, central cavity (CC), trabeculations, and intertrabecular recesses (IR). For each label we calculated the systolic fractional volume change (SFVC) in short-axis images (n=15) and systolic fractional area change (SFAC) in 4-chamber images (n=30), by dividing end-systolic to end-diastolic values. We measured the EF of IR, CC, and total cavity (TC). Three methods to calculate EF of the TC were compared: trabeculations included (per guidelines), IR excluded (Jacquier criterion), trabeculations contoured and excluded (contour-EF).

The SFVC and SFAC of the compact wall were similar with SFVC and SFAC of trabeculations (both P&gt;0.05). In contrast, the IR were more diminished in systole by comparison with the CC, having lower SFVC (39{&#43;/-}17% vs. 56{&#43;/-}16%, P&lt;0.001) and SFAC (37{&#43;/-}22% vs. 72{&#43;/-}12%, P&lt;0.001). EF of the IR was also greater than EF of the CC (61{&#43;/-}17% vs. 44{&#43;/-}16%, P&lt;0.001). Excluding IR from the TC or including trabeculations underestimates the contour-EF (44{&#43;/-}16% and 40{&#43;/-}12%, respectively, vs. 51{&#43;/-}16%; both P&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsThe trabecular layer has a high EF. Values of key prognostic indicators are better when this is accounted for.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlthough previous studies have presented a relevance between pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the precise role of PAT in CVDs remains uncertain.

MethodsIn the Mendelian randomization (MR) research, we extracted instrumental variants significantly correlated with PAT to assess its effects on CVDs. Inverse-variance weighted model was elected as the leading MR analytical method. F-statistic was utilized to assess the intensity of instrumental variants and avert weak-tool bias. Numerous sensitivity analyses were adopted to confirm the credibility of outcomes. The mediated effect of hypertension between PAT and CVDs was estimated in 2-step MR analysis.

ResultsThe MR research demonstrated genetically determined PAT was remarkably correlated with greater risks of cardiovascular disease (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09--1.22, P=1.32*10-6), heart failure (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.28--5.34, P=0.008), coronary heart disease (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.55--8.06, P=0.003), ischemic heart disease (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.14--4.67, P=0.020), ischemic stroke (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.63--6.20, P=0.001), and venous thromboembolism (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00--1.04, P=0.015). And the correlation was partially mediated by hypertension. Results were verified by sensitivity analysis.

ConclusionsGenetic determined PAT was remarkably correlated with additional risks of diverse CVDs. Identified as a mediator, hypertension had a significant influence on the causal association. The correlation between PAT and CVDs deserves further exploration.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE What Is New?This was the first Mendelian randomization research to detect the potential causal relationship of genetically determined PTA on multiple CVDs risks and confirm the mediating effect of hypertension on the causal association.

What Is Relevant?The MR research not only estimated the causal effect of PAT on hypertension but also identified the mediating role of hypertension between PAT and CVDs.

Clinical/Pathophysiological Implications?This study revealed PAT promoted CVDs progression and hypertension played an intermediary role, which indicated that PAT might serve as a potential therapeutic target and antihypertensive drugs could be conjunctly used to provide cardiovascular benefits.

especially for people with obesity, because they had more PAT accumulation.</p>
