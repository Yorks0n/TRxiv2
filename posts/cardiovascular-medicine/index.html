Interrogating distinct and overlapping mechanisms may shed new light on disease mechanisms. ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to: identify and compare (1) epidemiologic and (2) causal, genetic relationships between metabolites and CAD, PAD, and VTE. MethodsWe used metabolomic data from 95,402 individuals in the UK Biobank, excluding individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, first five principal components of ancestry, and statin use estimated the epidemiologic associations of 249 metabolites with incident CAD, PAD, or VTE. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) estimated the causal effects between metabolites and cardiovascular phenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics for metabolites (N = 118,466 from UK Biobank), CAD (N = 184,305 from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 2015), PAD (N = 243,060 from Million Veterans Project) and VTE (N = 650,119 from Million Veterans Project). Multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed in subsequent analyses. ResultsWe found that 194, 111, and 69 metabolites were epidemiologically associated (P \u003c 0.001) with CAD, PAD, and VTE, respectively. Metabolomic profiles exhibited variable similarity between disease pairs: CAD and PAD (N = 100 shared associations, R2 = 0.499), CAD and VTE (N = 68, R2 = 0.455), and PAD and VTE (N = 54, R2 = 0.752). MR revealed 28 metabolites that increased risk for both CAD and PAD and 2 metabolites that increased risk for CAD but decreased risk for VTE. Despite strong epidemiologic overlap, no metabolites had a shared genetic relationship between PAD and VTE. MVMR revealed several metabolites with shared causal effects on CAD and PAD related to cholesterol content within very-low-density lipoprotein particles. ConclusionsWhile common arterial and venous conditions are associated with overlapping metabolomic profiles, MR prioritized the role of remnant cholesterol in arterial diseases but not venous thrombosis.\nLarge language models to differentiate vasospastic angina using patient information\nAuthors: Kiyohara, Y.; Kodera, S.; Sato, M.; Ninomiya, K.; Sato, M.; Shinohara, H.; Takeda, N.; Akazawa, H.; Morita, H.; Komuro, I.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291913\nBackgroundVasospastic angina is sometimes suspected from patients medical history. It is essential to appropriately distinguish vasospastic angina from acute coronary syndrome because its standard treatment is pharmacotherapy, not catheter intervention. Large language models have recently been developed and are currently widely accessible. In this study, we aimed to use large language models to distinguish between vasospastic angina and acute coronary syndrome from patient information and compare the accuracies of these models. MethodWe searched for cases of vasospastic angina and acute coronary syndrome which were written in Japanese and published in online-accessible abstracts and journals, and randomly selected 66 cases as a test dataset. In addition, we selected another ten cases as data for few-shot learning. We used generative pre-trained transformer-3.5 and 4, and Bard, with zero- and few-shot learning. We evaluated the accuracies of the models using the test dataset. ResultsGenerative pre-trained transformer-3.5 with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 52%, sensitivity of 68%, and specificity of 29%; with few-shot learning, it achieved an accuracy of 52%, sensitivity of 26%, and specificity of 86%. Generative pre-trained transformer-4 with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 58%, sensitivity of 29%, and specificity of 96%; with few-shot learning, it achieved an accuracy of 61%, sensitivity of 63%, and specificity of 57%. Bard with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 47%, sensitivity of 16%, and specificity of 89%; with few-shot learning, this model could not be assessed because it failed to produce output. ConclusionGenerative pre-trained transformer-4 with few-shot learning was the best of all the models. The accuracies of models with zero- and few-shot learning were almost the same. In the future, models could be made more accurate by combining text data with other modalities.\nCombined near infrared photoacoustic imaging and ultrasound detects vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque\nAuthors: Schneider, M.; Wang, J.; Kare, A.; Adkar, S.; Salmi, D.; Bell, C.; Alsaigh, T.; Wagh, D.; Coller, J.; Mayer, A.; Snyder, S.; Borowsky, A. D.; Long, S. R.; Lansberg, M. G.; Steinberg, G. K.; Heit, J. J.; Leeper, N.; Ferrara, K. W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.11.23291099\nAtherosclerosis is an inflammatory process resulting in the deposition of cholesterol and cellular debris, narrowing of the vessel lumen and clot formation. Characterization of the morphology and vulnerability of the lesion is essential for effective clinical management. Photoacoustic imaging has sufficient penetration and sensitivity to map and characterize human atherosclerotic plaque. Here, near infrared photoacoustic imaging is shown to detect plaque components and, when combined with ultrasound imaging, to differentiate stable and vulnerable plaque. In an ex vivo study of photoacoustic imaging of excised plaque from 25 patients, 88.2% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity were achieved using a clinically-relevant protocol. In order to determine the origin of the near-infrared auto-photoacoustic (NIRAPA) signal, immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics were applied to adjacent sections of the plaque. The highest NIRAPA signal was spatially correlated with bilirubin and associated blood-based residue and inflammatory macrophages bearing CD74, HLA-DR, CD14 and CD163 markers. In summary, we establish the potential to apply the NIRAPA-ultrasound imaging combination to detect vulnerable carotid plaque.

C.; Lluri, G.; Lin, J.; Moore, J. P.; Van Arsdell, G.; Biniwale, R.; Si, M.-S.; Naini, B.; Venick, R.; Saab, S.; Wray, C.; Ponder, R.; Rosenthal, C.; Klomhaus, A.; Bostrom, K. I.; Aboulhosn, J. A.; Kaldas, F.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290997\nBackgroundThe molecular mechanisms underlying Fontan associated liver disease (FALD) remain largely unknown. We aimed to assess intrahepatic transcriptomic differences among patients with FALD according to the degree of liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included adults with the Fontan circulation at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data prior to the liver biopsy were extracted from medical records. Patients were classified into early (F1-F2) or advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples; RNA libraries were constructed using rRNA depletion method and sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and Metascape. Medical records were comprehensively reviewed for a composite clinical outcome which included decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, protein-losing enteropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or death. ResultsPatients with advanced fibrosis had higher serum BNP levels and Fontan, mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures. The composite clinical outcome was present in 23 patients (22%) and was predicted by age at Fontan, right ventricular morphology and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals on multivariable analysis. Samples with advanced fibrosis had 228 up-regulated genes compared to early fibrosis. Samples with the composite clinical outcome had 894 up-regulated genes compared to those without it. A total of 136 up-regulated genes were identified in both comparisons and these genes were enriched in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to oxidative stress, VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and vasculature development. ConclusionsPatients with FALD and advanced liver fibrosis or the composite clinical outcome exhibit up-regulated genes including pathways related to inflammation, congestion, and angiogenesis. This adds further insight into FALD pathophysiology.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundVasospastic angina is sometimes suspected from patients medical history. It is essential to appropriately distinguish vasospastic angina from acute coronary syndrome because its standard treatment is pharmacotherapy, not catheter intervention. Large language models have recently been developed and are currently widely accessible. In this study, we aimed to use large language models to distinguish between vasospastic angina and acute coronary syndrome from patient information and compare the accuracies of these models.

MethodWe searched for cases of vasospastic angina and acute coronary syndrome which were written in Japanese and published in online-accessible abstracts and journals, and randomly selected 66 cases as a test dataset. In addition, we selected another ten cases as data for few-shot learning. We used generative pre-trained transformer-3.5 and 4, and Bard, with zero- and few-shot learning. We evaluated the accuracies of the models using the test dataset.

ResultsGenerative pre-trained transformer-3.5 with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 52%, sensitivity of 68%, and specificity of 29%; with few-shot learning, it achieved an accuracy of 52%, sensitivity of 26%, and specificity of 86%. Generative pre-trained transformer-4 with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 58%, sensitivity of 29%, and specificity of 96%; with few-shot learning, it achieved an accuracy of 61%, sensitivity of 63%, and specificity of 57%. Bard with zero-shot learning achieved an accuracy of 47%, sensitivity of 16%, and specificity of 89%; with few-shot learning, this model could not be assessed because it failed to produce output.

ConclusionGenerative pre-trained transformer-4 with few-shot learning was the best of all the models. The accuracies of models with zero- and few-shot learning were almost the same. In the future, models could be made more accurate by combining text data with other modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process resulting in the deposition of cholesterol and cellular debris, narrowing of the vessel lumen and clot formation. Characterization of the morphology and vulnerability of the lesion is essential for effective clinical management. Photoacoustic imaging has sufficient penetration and sensitivity to map and characterize human atherosclerotic plaque. Here, near infrared photoacoustic imaging is shown to detect plaque components and, when combined with ultrasound imaging, to differentiate stable and vulnerable plaque. In an ex vivo study of photoacoustic imaging of excised plaque from 25 patients, 88.2% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity were achieved using a clinically-relevant protocol. In order to determine the origin of the near-infrared auto-photoacoustic (NIRAPA) signal, immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics were applied to adjacent sections of the plaque. The highest NIRAPA signal was spatially correlated with bilirubin and associated blood-based residue and inflammatory macrophages bearing CD74, HLA-DR, CD14 and CD163 markers. In summary, we establish the potential to apply the NIRAPA-ultrasound imaging combination to detect vulnerable carotid plaque.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe molecular mechanisms underlying Fontan associated liver disease (FALD) remain largely unknown. We aimed to assess intrahepatic transcriptomic differences among patients with FALD according to the degree of liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included adults with the Fontan circulation at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data prior to the liver biopsy were extracted from medical records. Patients were classified into early (F1-F2) or advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples; RNA libraries were constructed using rRNA depletion method and sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and Metascape. Medical records were comprehensively reviewed for a composite clinical outcome which included decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, protein-losing enteropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or death.

ResultsPatients with advanced fibrosis had higher serum BNP levels and Fontan, mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures. The composite clinical outcome was present in 23 patients (22%) and was predicted by age at Fontan, right ventricular morphology and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals on multivariable analysis. Samples with advanced fibrosis had 228 up-regulated genes compared to early fibrosis. Samples with the composite clinical outcome had 894 up-regulated genes compared to those without it. A total of 136 up-regulated genes were identified in both comparisons and these genes were enriched in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to oxidative stress, VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and vasculature development.

ConclusionsPatients with FALD and advanced liver fibrosis or the composite clinical outcome exhibit up-regulated genes including pathways related to inflammation, congestion, and angiogenesis. This adds further insight into FALD pathophysiology.</p>
