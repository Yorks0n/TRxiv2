K.; B\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23295485\nTo broaden our understanding of bradyarrhythmias and diseases of the cardiac conduction system, we performed cross-sectional multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analyses in up to 1.3 million individuals for sinus node dysfunction (SND), distal conduction disease (DCD), and pacemaker implantation (PM). We evaluated the biological relevance of bradyarrhythmia loci by analyses of transcriptomes, pleiotropy, and partitioned heritability based on cardiac single cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we performed rare variant burden testing in 460,000 whole exome sequenced individuals from two biobanks. We identified 13, 28, and 21 common variant loci for SND, DCD, and PM, respectively. Four well-known common variant arrhythmia loci (SCN5A/SCN10A, CCDC141, TBX20, and CAMK2D) were shared for SND and DCD, while other loci were more specific for either SND or DCD. Cardiomyocyte-expressed genes were strongly enriched for contributions to DCD heritability, while SND and PM were more heterogeneous. Rare variant analyses implicated LMNA for all bradyarrhythmia subtypes; SMAD6 and SCN5A for DCD; and TTN, MYBPC3, and SCN5A for PM. The genetic architectures of SND and DCD are both overlapping and distinct. Multiple genetic mechanisms involving ion channels, sarcomeric components, cellular homeostasis, and cardiac development may influence the development of bradyarrhythmias.\nNovel Liver Injury Phenotypes and Outcomes in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\nAuthors: Scott, J.; Moutchia Suh, J.; McClelland, R. L.; Al-Naamani, N.; Weinberg, E.; Palevsky, H.; Minhas, J. K.; Appleby, D. H.; Smith, K. A.; Ventetuolo, C. E.; Kawut, S. M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296316\nBackground: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are disorders of the pulmonary vasculature that cause right ventricular dysfunction. Systemic consequences of right ventricular dysfunction include damage to other solid organs, such as the liver. However, the profiles and consequences of hepatic injury due to PAH and CTEPH have not been well-studied. Methods: We aimed to identify underlying patterns of liver injury in a cohort of PAH and CTEPH patients enrolled in 15 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1998 and 2012. We used unsupervised machine learning to identify liver injury clusters in 13 trials and validated the findings in two additional trials. We then determined whether these liver injury clusters were associated with clinical outcomes or treatment effect heterogeneity. Results: Our training dataset included 4,219 patients and our validation dataset included 1,756 patients with complete liver laboratory panels (serum total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and albumin). Using k- means clustering paired with factor analysis, we identified four unique liver phenotypes (no liver injury, hepatocellular injury, cholestatic injury, and combined injury patterns). Patients in the cholestatic injury liver cluster had the shortest time to clinical worsening and highest chance of worsening World Health Organization functional class. Randomization to the experimental arm was associated with a transition to healthier liver clusters compared to randomization to the control arm. The cholestatic injury group experienced the greatest placebo-corrected treatment benefit in terms of six-minute walk distance. 3 Conclusions: Liver injury patterns were associated with adverse outcomes in patients with PAH and CTEPH. Randomization to active treatment of pulmonary hypertension in these clinical trials had beneficial effects on liver health compared to placebo. The role of liver disease in determining outcomes warrants prospective studies of the clinical utility of liver phenotyping for PAH prognosis and contribution to clinical disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To broaden our understanding of bradyarrhythmias and diseases of the cardiac conduction system, we performed cross-sectional multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analyses in up to 1.3 million individuals for sinus node dysfunction (SND), distal conduction disease (DCD), and pacemaker implantation (PM). We evaluated the biological relevance of bradyarrhythmia loci by analyses of transcriptomes, pleiotropy, and partitioned heritability based on cardiac single cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we performed rare variant burden testing in 460,000 whole exome sequenced individuals from two biobanks. We identified 13, 28, and 21 common variant loci for SND, DCD, and PM, respectively. Four well-known common variant arrhythmia loci (SCN5A/SCN10A, CCDC141, TBX20, and CAMK2D) were shared for SND and DCD, while other loci were more specific for either SND or DCD. Cardiomyocyte-expressed genes were strongly enriched for contributions to DCD heritability, while SND and PM were more heterogeneous. Rare variant analyses implicated LMNA for all bradyarrhythmia subtypes; SMAD6 and SCN5A for DCD; and TTN, MYBPC3, and SCN5A for PM. The genetic architectures of SND and DCD are both overlapping and distinct. Multiple genetic mechanisms involving ion channels, sarcomeric components, cellular homeostasis, and cardiac development may influence the development of bradyarrhythmias.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are disorders of the pulmonary vasculature that cause right ventricular dysfunction. Systemic consequences of right ventricular dysfunction include damage to other solid organs, such as the liver. However, the profiles and consequences of hepatic injury due to PAH and CTEPH have not been well-studied. Methods: We aimed to identify underlying patterns of liver injury in a cohort of PAH and CTEPH patients enrolled in 15 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1998 and 2012. We used unsupervised machine learning to identify liver injury clusters in 13 trials and validated the findings in two additional trials. We then determined whether these liver injury clusters were associated with clinical outcomes or treatment effect heterogeneity. Results: Our training dataset included 4,219 patients and our validation dataset included 1,756 patients with complete liver laboratory panels (serum total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and albumin). Using k- means clustering paired with factor analysis, we identified four unique liver phenotypes (no liver injury, hepatocellular injury, cholestatic injury, and combined injury patterns). Patients in the cholestatic injury liver cluster had the shortest time to clinical worsening and highest chance of worsening World Health Organization functional class. Randomization to the experimental arm was associated with a transition to healthier liver clusters compared to randomization to the control arm. The cholestatic injury group experienced the greatest placebo-corrected treatment benefit in terms of six-minute walk distance. 3 Conclusions: Liver injury patterns were associated with adverse outcomes in patients with PAH and CTEPH. Randomization to active treatment of pulmonary hypertension in these clinical trials had beneficial effects on liver health compared to placebo. The role of liver disease in determining outcomes warrants prospective studies of the clinical utility of liver phenotyping for PAH prognosis and contribution to clinical disease.</p>
