MethodsComprehensive details, encompassing the first authors name, publication year, sample inclusion criteria, sample size, and demographic characteristics, including age and gender of participants, were systematically extracted from all incorporated studies. Meanwhile, the analysis encompassed the assessment of the risk associated with nineteen cardiovascular outcomes. ResultsA total of 3, 201 potentially eligible studies were initially identified for consideration. Following rigorous literature screening and quality control measures, eighteen studies, encompassing 46, 083, 975 patients, met the specified criteria. In comparison to the control cohort, our investigation unveiled a heightened risk of 19 cardiovascular outcomes associated with long COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55-1.81) (I2 = 69.1%, p= 0.000) for the overall risk of cardiovascular outcomes, indicating an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals affected by long COVID-19. While the heterogeneity was relatively high, it is essential to acknowledge that all studies inherently carry an unavoidable risk of bias, irrespective of their quality rating. Moreover, there appears to be no significant publication bias based on the funnel plot, Beggs, and Eggers tests. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal substantial alterations in the overall stability of the results. ConclusionsOur meta-analysis substantiates that individuals afflicted with long COVID-19 face an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Routine assessment of cardiac function is deemed essential for a long COVID-19 high-risk cardiovascular disease population. Timely interventions have the potential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated mortality in this population.

M.; Tamlander, M.; Hlushchenko, I.; Ripatti, S.; Pfisterer, S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299827\nAimsLack of functional information for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mutations limits the use of genetics for early diagnosis, risk assessment and clinical decision making in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem. MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression. Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (\"Loss-of-function\", 0-10% activity; \"defective\", 10-30%; \"mildly-defective\", 30-70%; and \"non-defective\", \u003e 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants. ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making. Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.\nResonance sonomanometry for noninvasive, continuous monitoring of blood pressure\nAuthors: Jimenez, R.; Yurk, D.; Dell, S.; Rutledge, A. C.; Fu, M. K.; Dempsey, W. P.; Abu-Mostafa, Y.; Rajagopal, A.; Rajagopal, A. B.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300502\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing methods for continuous, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring suffer from poor accuracy, uncomfortable form factors, or a need for frequent calibration, limiting their adoption. We introduce a new framework for continuous BP measurement that is noninvasive and calibration-free. The method uses acoustic stimulation to induce resonance of the artery wall. Ultrasound imaging is used to measure resonance and capture arterial dimensions which are related to blood pressure via a fully-determined physical model. The approach and model are validated in vitro using arterial mock-ups and then in multiple arteries in human subjects. Further development could facilitate more robust continuous blood pressure measurement, providing significant benefits for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.\nIntegrative proteomic analyses across common cardiac diseases yield new mechanistic insights and enhanced prediction\nAuthors: Schuermans, A.; Pournamdari, A. B.; Lee, J.; Bhukar, R.; Ganesh, S.; Darosa, N.; Small, A. M.; Yu, Z.; Hornsby, W.; Koyama, S.; Januzzi, J. L.; Honigberg, M. C.; Natarajan, P.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300218\nCardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P\u003c8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.\nArtificial intelligence for ventricular arrhythmia capability using ambulatory electrocardiograms\nAuthors: Barker, J.; Li, X.; Kotb, A.; Mavilakandy, A.; Antoun, I.; Thaitirarot, C.; Koev, I.; Man, S.; Sclindwein, F. S.; Dhutia, H.; Chin, S. H.; Tyukin, I.; Nicolson, W. B.; Ng, G. A.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300017\nLay AbstractO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan artificial intelligence (AI) be used to predict if a person is at risk of a lethal heart rhythm, based solely on an electrocardiogram (an electrical heart tracing)? FindingsIn a study of 270 adults (of which 159 had lethal arrhythmias), the AI was correct in 4 out of every 5 cases. If the AI said a person was at risk, the risk of lethal event was three times higher than normal adults. MeaningIn this study, the AI performed better than current medical guidelines. The AI was able accurately determine the risk of lethal arrhythmia from standard heart tracings over a year away which is a conceptual shift in what an AI model can see and predict. This method shows promise in better allocating implantable shock box pacemakers (ICDs) that saves lives. Scientific AbstractO_ST_ABSAimC_ST_ABSCurrent clinical practice guidelines for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are insufficiently accurate for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) risk stratification leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence offers novel risk stratification lens through which VA capability can be determined from electrocardiogram in normal sinus rhythm. The aim was to develop and test a deep neural network for VA risk stratification using routinely collected ambulatory electrocardiograms. MethodsA multicentre case-control study was undertaken to assess VA-ResNet-50, our open source ResNet-50 based deep neural network. VA-ResNet-50 was designed to read pyramid samples of 3-lead 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to decide if a heart is capable of VA based on the electrocardiogram alone. Consecutive adults with VA from East Midlands, UK, who had ambulatory electrocardiograms as part of their NHS care between 2014 and 2022 were recruited and compared to all comer ambulatory electrocardiograms without VA. ResultsOf 270 patients, 159 heterogeneous patients had a composite VA outcome. The mean time difference between the electrocardiogram and VA was 1.6 years ([1/3] ambulatory electrocardiogram before VA). The deep neural network was able to classify electrocardiograms for VA capability with an accuracy of 0.76 (CI 95% 0.66 - 0.87), F1 score of 0.79 (0.67 - 0.90), AUC of 0.8 (0.67 - 0.91) and RR of 2.87 (1.41 - 5.81). ConclusionAmbulatory electrocardiograms confer risk signals for VA risk stratification when analysed using VA-ResNet-50. Pyramid sampling from the ambulatory electrocardiograms is hypothesised to capture autonomic activity. We encourage groups to build on this open-source model.\nLDLR Variant Classification for Improved Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Familial Hypercholesterolemia\nAuthors: Ibrahim, S.; Hartgers, M. L.; Reeskamp, L. F.; Zuurbier, L.; Defesche, J. C.; Kastelein, J. J. P.; Stroes, E. S.; Hovingh, G. K.; Huijgen, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300621\nBackgroundFamilial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder marked by high LDL cholesterol and an increased premature coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Current dichotomous classification of LDL receptor gene (LDLR) variants may inadequately capture patient variability in LDL cholesterol levels and CAD risk. This study assessed a novel approach for assessing LDLR variant severity using variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles. MethodsParticipants of the Dutch FH cascade screening program were screened for 456 LDLR variants. Sex- and age-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles were computed for each LDLR variant carrier. These percentiles were used to calculate the mean LDL cholesterol percentile for each variant. Based on the variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles, carriers were grouped into the following strata: \u003c75th, 75th-88th, 88th-92nd, 92nd-96.5th, 96.5th-98th, and [\u0026ge;]98th percentile. Additionally, variants were categorized into class 1 (LDLR deficient) and non-class 1 (often LDLR defective) variants. CAD risk between carriers in the different strata and non-carriers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model. ResultsOut of 35,257 participants, 12,485 (36%) LDLR variant carriers were identified. Carriers had a 5-fold higher CAD risk compared with non-carriers. Hazard ratios for CAD increased gradually from 2.2 (95%CI 0.97-5.0) to 12.0 (95%CI 5.5-24.8) across the strata. A 7.3-fold and 3.9-fold increased CAD risk was observed in carriers of class 1 and non-class 1 LDLR variants, respectively. ConclusionsThis study presents a refined approach for classifying LDLR variants based on their impact on LDL cholesterol levels, allowing for more precise, genotype-specific CAD risk estimation in FH patients compared with traditional methods.\nIdentification of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy on Electrocardiographic Images with Deep Learning\nAuthors: Sangha, V.; Dhingra, L. S.; Oikonomou, E. K.; Aminorroaya, A.; Sikand, N. V.; Sen, S.; Krumholz, H. M.; Khera, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.23300490\nBackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts. MethodsWe identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness \u003e 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. ResultsOverall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5). ConclusionsWe developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM.\nClinical Impact of Calcified Nodules in Patients with Severely Calcified Lesions Treated by Rotational Atherectomy: A Serial Optical Coherence Tomography Study\nAuthors: Narui, S.; Yamamoto, M. H.; Mori, H.; Amemiya, K.; Okabe, T.; Koyanagi, Y.; Ito, Y.; Gibo, Y.; Okura, T.; Fujioka, T.; Ishigaki, S.; Usumoto, S.; Kimura, T.; Suguru, S.; Saito, J.; Oyama, Y.; Igawa, W.; Ono, M.; ISOMURA, N.; Ochiai, M.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300649\nBackground: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for lesions with calcified nodules (CNs) is associated with worse outcomes than PCI for other calcified lesions. We aimed to clarify the relationship between CNs at index PCI, optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings at 8-month follow-up, and clinical outcomes using serial OCT. Methods This retrospective observational study utilized data from a prospective, single-center registry. We conducted consecutive PCI for calcified lesions requiring rotational atherectomy (RA) with OCT guidance. We categorized 51 patients (54 lesions) into those with (16 patients [16 lesions]) and without CNs (35 patients [38 lesions]). Results: Post-PCI, stent expansion was comparable between the two groups, and CN-like protrusion was observed in 75% of patients in the CN group. Follow-up OCT at 8 months revealed in-stent CNs in 54% of treated CN lesions with CN-like protrusion, whereas non-CN lesions lacked in-stent CNs. The CN group exhibited greater maximum neointimal tissue (NIT) thickness than the non-CN group (p\u003c0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that CN was associated with maximum NIT (p=0.02). Consequently, the CN group exhibited a higher clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate than the non-CN group at 1 (p=0.009) and 5 years (p=0.02). TLR primarily occurred in lesions with maximum CN angles \u003e180{degrees}. Conclusions: Following RA treatment with acceptable stent expansion, the presence of CNs before PCI correlated with greater neointimal tissue formation with in-stent CNs, resulting in a higher TLR rate, especially in lesions with maximum CN angles exceeding 180{degrees}.\nImpact of changes in Achilles tendon thickening on cardiovascular events in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia\nAuthors: Tada, H.; Kojima, N.; Takeji, Y.; Nohara, A.; Kawashiri, M.-a.; Takamura, M.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300597\nBackgroundAchilles tendon thickening (ATT) can be ameliorated by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) defines ATT as [\u0026ge;]8.0 mm in males and [\u0026ge;]7.5 mm in females. We aimed to determine the clinical impact of changes in ATT on the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed heterozygous FH (HeFH) (N = 1273; 614 males, 659 females) with ATT data from X-ray were assessed. Patients were divided into four groups: patients without ATT from baseline until follow-up (group 1), patients without ATT at baseline but developed ATT at follow-up (group 2), patients with ATT at baseline but regressed at follow-up (group 3), and patients with ATT from baseline until follow-up (group 4). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors associated with MACE, including cardiovascular death and any coronary events. ResultsOn follow-up (median: 10.9 years), 142 MACEs were observed, and the median ATT regressed from 7.8 to 7.6 mm. Changes in ATT were significantly associated with the occurrence of MACE in all groups, when compared to group 1 (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-4.13 [p \u003c 0.001], HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.08-3.28, [p \u003c 0.001], HR: 6.34, 95% CI: 3.10-9.58, [p \u003c 0.001], in groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively). ConclusionsAssessing ATT has diagnostic value and allows for risk stratification among patients with HeFH.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivateTo assess demographic characteristics and investigate the correlation between cardiovascular diseases and long COVID-19 patients.

MethodsComprehensive details, encompassing the first authors name, publication year, sample inclusion criteria, sample size, and demographic characteristics, including age and gender of participants, were systematically extracted from all incorporated studies. Meanwhile, the analysis encompassed the assessment of the risk associated with nineteen cardiovascular outcomes.

ResultsA total of 3, 201 potentially eligible studies were initially identified for consideration. Following rigorous literature screening and quality control measures, eighteen studies, encompassing 46, 083, 975 patients, met the specified criteria. In comparison to the control cohort, our investigation unveiled a heightened risk of 19 cardiovascular outcomes associated with long COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55-1.81) (I2 = 69.1%, p= 0.000) for the overall risk of cardiovascular outcomes, indicating an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals affected by long COVID-19. While the heterogeneity was relatively high, it is essential to acknowledge that all studies inherently carry an unavoidable risk of bias, irrespective of their quality rating. Moreover, there appears to be no significant publication bias based on the funnel plot, Beggs, and Eggers tests. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal substantial alterations in the overall stability of the results.

ConclusionsOur meta-analysis substantiates that individuals afflicted with long COVID-19 face an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Routine assessment of cardiac function is deemed essential for a long COVID-19 high-risk cardiovascular disease population. Timely interventions have the potential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated mortality in this population.

        <p class="abstract">AimsLack of functional information for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mutations limits the use of genetics for early diagnosis, risk assessment and clinical decision making in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem.

MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression.

Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (&#34;Loss-of-function&#34;, 0-10% activity; &#34;defective&#34;, 10-30%; &#34;mildly-defective&#34;, 30-70%; and &#34;non-defective&#34;, &gt; 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants.

ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making.

Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing methods for continuous, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring suffer from poor accuracy, uncomfortable form factors, or a need for frequent calibration, limiting their adoption. We introduce a new framework for continuous BP measurement that is noninvasive and calibration-free. The method uses acoustic stimulation to induce resonance of the artery wall. Ultrasound imaging is used to measure resonance and capture arterial dimensions which are related to blood pressure via a fully-determined physical model. The approach and model are validated in vitro using arterial mock-ups and then in multiple arteries in human subjects. Further development could facilitate more robust continuous blood pressure measurement, providing significant benefits for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiac diseases represent common highly morbid conditions for which underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged 1,459 protein measurements in 44,313 UK Biobank participants to characterize the circulating proteome associated with incident coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression identified 820 protein-disease associations--including 441 proteins--at Bonferroni-adjusted P&lt;8.6x10-6. Cis-Mendelian randomization suggested causal roles that aligned with epidemiological findings for 6% of proteins identified in primary analyses, prioritizing novel therapeutic targets for different cardiac diseases (e.g., interleukin-4 receptor for heart failure and spondin-1 for atrial fibrillation). Interaction analyses identified seven protein-disease associations that differed Bonferroni-significantly by sex. Models incorporating proteomic data (vs. clinical risk factors alone) improved prediction for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These results lay a foundation for future investigations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and assess the clinical utility of protein-based prevention strategies for cardiac diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lay AbstractO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan artificial intelligence (AI) be used to predict if a person is at risk of a lethal heart rhythm, based solely on an electrocardiogram (an electrical heart tracing)?

FindingsIn a study of 270 adults (of which 159 had lethal arrhythmias), the AI was correct in 4 out of every 5 cases. If the AI said a person was at risk, the risk of lethal event was three times higher than normal adults.

MeaningIn this study, the AI performed better than current medical guidelines. The AI was able accurately determine the risk of lethal arrhythmia from standard heart tracings over a year away which is a conceptual shift in what an AI model can see and predict. This method shows promise in better allocating implantable shock box pacemakers (ICDs) that saves lives.

Scientific AbstractO_ST_ABSAimC_ST_ABSCurrent clinical practice guidelines for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are insufficiently accurate for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) risk stratification leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence offers novel risk stratification lens through which VA capability can be determined from electrocardiogram in normal sinus rhythm. The aim was to develop and test a deep neural network for VA risk stratification using routinely collected ambulatory electrocardiograms.

MethodsA multicentre case-control study was undertaken to assess VA-ResNet-50, our open source ResNet-50 based deep neural network. VA-ResNet-50 was designed to read pyramid samples of 3-lead 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to decide if a heart is capable of VA based on the electrocardiogram alone. Consecutive adults with VA from East Midlands, UK, who had ambulatory electrocardiograms as part of their NHS care between 2014 and 2022 were recruited and compared to all comer ambulatory electrocardiograms without VA.

ResultsOf 270 patients, 159 heterogeneous patients had a composite VA outcome. The mean time difference between the electrocardiogram and VA was 1.6 years ([1/3] ambulatory electrocardiogram before VA). The deep neural network was able to classify electrocardiograms for VA capability with an accuracy of 0.76 (CI 95% 0.66 - 0.87), F1 score of 0.79 (0.67 - 0.90), AUC of 0.8 (0.67 - 0.91) and RR of 2.87 (1.41 - 5.81).

ConclusionAmbulatory electrocardiograms confer risk signals for VA risk stratification when analysed using VA-ResNet-50. Pyramid sampling from the ambulatory electrocardiograms is hypothesised to capture autonomic activity. We encourage groups to build on this open-source model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFamilial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder marked by high LDL cholesterol and an increased premature coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Current dichotomous classification of LDL receptor gene (LDLR) variants may inadequately capture patient variability in LDL cholesterol levels and CAD risk. This study assessed a novel approach for assessing LDLR variant severity using variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles.

MethodsParticipants of the Dutch FH cascade screening program were screened for 456 LDLR variants. Sex- and age-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles were computed for each LDLR variant carrier. These percentiles were used to calculate the mean LDL cholesterol percentile for each variant. Based on the variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles, carriers were grouped into the following strata: &lt;75th, 75th-88th, 88th-92nd, 92nd-96.5th, 96.5th-98th, and [&amp;ge;]98th percentile. Additionally, variants were categorized into class 1 (LDLR deficient) and non-class 1 (often LDLR defective) variants. CAD risk between carriers in the different strata and non-carriers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model.

ResultsOut of 35,257 participants, 12,485 (36%) LDLR variant carriers were identified. Carriers had a 5-fold higher CAD risk compared with non-carriers. Hazard ratios for CAD increased gradually from 2.2 (95%CI 0.97-5.0) to 12.0 (95%CI 5.5-24.8) across the strata. A 7.3-fold and 3.9-fold increased CAD risk was observed in carriers of class 1 and non-class 1 LDLR variants, respectively.

ConclusionsThis study presents a refined approach for classifying LDLR variants based on their impact on LDL cholesterol levels, allowing for more precise, genotype-specific CAD risk estimation in FH patients compared with traditional methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts.

MethodsWe identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness &gt; 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping.

ResultsOverall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5).

ConclusionsWe developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for lesions with calcified nodules (CNs) is associated with worse outcomes than PCI for other calcified lesions. We aimed to clarify the relationship between CNs at index PCI, optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings at 8-month follow-up, and clinical outcomes using serial OCT. Methods This retrospective observational study utilized data from a prospective, single-center registry. We conducted consecutive PCI for calcified lesions requiring rotational atherectomy (RA) with OCT guidance. We categorized 51 patients (54 lesions) into those with (16 patients [16 lesions]) and without CNs (35 patients [38 lesions]). Results: Post-PCI, stent expansion was comparable between the two groups, and CN-like protrusion was observed in 75% of patients in the CN group. Follow-up OCT at 8 months revealed in-stent CNs in 54% of treated CN lesions with CN-like protrusion, whereas non-CN lesions lacked in-stent CNs. The CN group exhibited greater maximum neointimal tissue (NIT) thickness than the non-CN group (p&lt;0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that CN was associated with maximum NIT (p=0.02). Consequently, the CN group exhibited a higher clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate than the non-CN group at 1 (p=0.009) and 5 years (p=0.02). TLR primarily occurred in lesions with maximum CN angles &gt;180{degrees}. Conclusions: Following RA treatment with acceptable stent expansion, the presence of CNs before PCI correlated with greater neointimal tissue formation with in-stent CNs, resulting in a higher TLR rate, especially in lesions with maximum CN angles exceeding 180{degrees}.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAchilles tendon thickening (ATT) can be ameliorated by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) defines ATT as [&amp;ge;]8.0 mm in males and [&amp;ge;]7.5 mm in females. We aimed to determine the clinical impact of changes in ATT on the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed heterozygous FH (HeFH) (N = 1273; 614 males, 659 females) with ATT data from X-ray were assessed. Patients were divided into four groups: patients without ATT from baseline until follow-up (group 1), patients without ATT at baseline but developed ATT at follow-up (group 2), patients with ATT at baseline but regressed at follow-up (group 3), and patients with ATT from baseline until follow-up (group 4). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors associated with MACE, including cardiovascular death and any coronary events.

ResultsOn follow-up (median: 10.9 years), 142 MACEs were observed, and the median ATT regressed from 7.8 to 7.6 mm. Changes in ATT were significantly associated with the occurrence of MACE in all groups, when compared to group 1 (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-4.13 [p &lt; 0.001], HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.08-3.28, [p &lt; 0.001], HR: 6.34, 95% CI: 3.10-9.58, [p &lt; 0.001], in groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

ConclusionsAssessing ATT has diagnostic value and allows for risk stratification among patients with HeFH.</p>
