ObjectivesDue to the lack of agreement on the optimal treatment for CSFP, we decided to examine the effectiveness of sildenafil in this context. MethodsWe assessed the eligibility of 196 CSFP patients to participate in a 12-week, triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study for receiving either 50 mg daily oral sildenafil or placebo. We evaluated the efficacy of sildenafil based on exercise tolerance test parameters, severity of angina, adverse effects, and major adverse cardiovascular events. ResultsTwenty eligible patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to two groups. Sildenafil demonstrated significant efficacy in improving angina severity, with all recipients achieving a Class I angina severity, contrasting with a 40% attainment in the placebo group (P=0.011). Notably, Sildenafil induced statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, unlike the placebo group. Although a reduction in the QT interval favored Sildenafil (-21 millisecond vs +3 milliseconds), statistical significance was not reached (P=0.09 vs. P=0.67). Moreover, Sildenafil markedly improved Duke Treadmill Score (DTS) (P=0.005), while the placebo group showed non-significant improvement. Concurrently, the Sildenafil group exhibited significant enhancements in functional capacity (METs) and maximum heart rate during exercise testing compared to the placebo group. ConclusionsWe suggest that a daily low dose of sildenafil could be a valuable therapeutic option for CSFP.

Methods154 patients that underwent ASA at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, between 2009 and 2021, were retrospectively included. Anatomical and hemodynamic parameters were collected from invasive catheterization before and during ASA, and from echocardiography (ECHO) examinations before, during, and at one-year follow-up after ASA. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between sex, BSWT, AML, PML, and outcome defined as remaining LVOTO (\u003e30 mmHg) after ASA. ResultsThe median follow-up was 364 days (IQR 334-385 days). BSWT \u003e23 mm (n=13, 12%) was associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up (p=0.004). Elongated MVLL (either AML or PML) was present in 125 (90%) of the patients. Elongated AML (\u003e24 mm) was present in 67 (44%) of the patients, although AML length was not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. Elongated PML (\u003e14 mm) was present in 114 (74%) and not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. No significant sex differences were observed regarding remaining LVOTO. ConclusionECHO measurement of BSWT can be used effectively for patient selection for successful ASA and for identification of patients with a risk of incomplete resolution of LVOTO after ASA.\n",
