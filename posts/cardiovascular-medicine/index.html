Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.\nSex-specific cardiovascular risk factors in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: St Pierre, S. R.; Kaczmarski, B. K.; Peirlinck, M.; Kuhl, E.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297622\nThe lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individuals risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors as well as tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score, and quantify the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. Strikingly, for first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that, out of the top 10 features across three sex and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40-50%, electrocardiogram 30-33%, pulse wave analysis 13-23%, and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound 0-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

H. I.; Lee, T. T. L.; Leung, B. K.-h.; Ngai, A. L.; Khan, A.; Wong, W. T.; Wai, A. K. C.; Chen, K. Y.; Liu, T.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297656\nBackgroundWeb-based risk prediction tools for cardiovascular diseases are crucial for providing rapid risk estimates for busy clinicians, but there is none available specifically for Chinese subjects. This study developed ChineseCVD, first-in-world web-based Chinese-specific Cardiovascular Risk Calculator incorporating long COVID, COVID-19 vaccination, SGLT2i and PCSK9i treatment effects. MethodsAdult patients attending government-funded family medicine clinics in Hong Kong between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003 were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attacks/ischaemic strokes, and cardiovascular mortality. ResultsA total of 155,066 patients were used as the derivation cohort. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) had MACE. Cox regression identified male gender, age, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and laboratory test results (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL) as significant predictors of the above outcomes. ChineseCVD further incorporates the impact of smoking status, COVID-19 infection, number of COVID-19 vaccination doses, and modifier effects of newest medication classes of PCSK9i and SGLT2i. The calculator enables clinicians to demonstrate to patients how risks vary with different medications. ConclusionsThe ChineseCVD risk calculator enables rapid web-based risk assessment for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making at the bedside or in the clinic.\nEchocardiographic characterisation in severe Covid-19 with respiratory failure - an observational study.\nAuthors: Isackson, H.; Larsson, A.; Lipcsey, M.; Frithiof, R.; Flachskampf, F.; Hultstrom, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297666\nObjectiveWe aimed to investigate cardiac effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of echocardiography-assessment and biomarkers. MethodsThis is an observational study of the first patients admitted to intensive care due to SARS-CoV-2-respiratory failure. Thirty-four underwent echocardiography of which twenty-five were included, compared to forty-four non-echo patients. Exclusion was based on absence of normofrequent sinus rhythm and/or mechanical respiratory support. Biomarkers were analysed on clinical indication. ResultsMortality was higher in the echo-compared to non-echo group (44 % vs. 16%, p\u003c0.05). Right-sided parameters were not under significant strain. Tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicated how increased pulmonary pressure was associated with mortality (survivors: 2.51 {+/-} 0.01 m/s vs. non-survivors: 3.06 {+/-} 0.11 m/s, p\u003c0.05), before multiple comparison-correction. Setting cut-off for pulmonary hypertension to 2.8 m/s generated p\u003c0.01 using frequency distribution testing. Cardiac markers, high sensitivity cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were higher in the echocardiography group. (hs-TnI (ng/L): echo : 133 {+/-} 45 vs. non-echo: 81.3 {+/-} 45, p\u003c0.01; NT-proBNP (ng/L): echo: 2959 {+/-} 573 vs. non-echo: 1641 {+/-} 420, p\u003c0.001; D-dimer (mg/L): echo: 16.1 {+/-} 3.7 vs. non-echo: 6.1 {+/-} 1.5, p\u003c0.01) and non-survivor group (hs-TnI (ng/L): survivors: 59.1 {+/-} 21 vs. non-survivors: 211 {+/-} 105, p\u003c0.0001; NT-proBNP (ng/L): survivors: 1310 {+/-} 314 vs. non-survivors: 4065 {+/-} 740, p\u003c0.0001; D-dimer (mg/L): survivors: 7.2 {+/-} 1.5 vs. non-survivors: 17.1 {+/-} 4.8, p\u003c0.01). Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was positively correlated with cardiac troponin I (r=0.93, r2=0.74, p\u003c0.001). ConclusionsThese results suggest there is no negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary pressure appears higher amongst non-survivors indicating pulmonary disease as the driver of mortality. Echocardiography was more commonly performed in the non-survivor group, and cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer was higher in the non-survivor group suggesting they carry negative prognostic values. Trial registration numberThis is an observational study from patients included in \"Clinical trials NCT04316884\" Strength and limitations of this study- The patient cohort is recruited from consecutive patients admitted to the ICU in need of mechanical respiratory support independent of background which makes it relevant to clinical practice. - The echocardiographic image acquisition was carried out by hospital assigned agents on clinical indication, which makes the results applicable in a clinical setting. - Since the image acquisition was carried out on a clinical indication, the results may be skewed towards the false positive if applied to all Covid19 patients.\nAutomatic Detection of Cardiac Conditions from Photos of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Captured by Smartphones\nAuthors: WONG, C. K.; Lau, Y. M.; Lui, H. W.; Chan, W.-F.; San, W.-C.; ZHOU, M.; CHENG, Y.-y.; Huang, D.; Lai, W.-H.; Lau, Y.-M.; Siu, C.-W.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297947\nBackground: Artificial intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic algorithms can achieve cardiologist-level accuracy, but their clinical use is limited as they cannot be installed in older ECG machines. Objective: To develop a smartphone application that extracts and analyzes ECG waveforms from photos using machine learning techniques. Methods: A smartphone application was developed to automatically extract ECG waveforms from photos taken by clinicians using computer vision and machine learning. Custom designed machine learning models were developed to perform waveform identification, gridline removal, and scale calibration. The extracted voltage-time series waveforms were analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning-based diagnostic algorithms, and the accuracy of the proof-of-concept application was assessed. Results: Waveforms from 40,516 scanned and 444 photographed ECGs were automatically extracted. 12,828 of 13,258 (96.8%) scanned and 5,399 of 5,743 (94.0%) photographed waveforms were correctly cropped and labelled. 11,604 of 12,735 (91.1%) scanned and 5,062 of 5,752 (88.0%) photographed waveforms achieved successful voltage-time signal extraction after automatic gridline and background noise removal. The AF diagnostic algorithm achieved 91.3% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity, 95.6% positive predictive value, 88.6% negative predictive value and 93.4% F1 score. Conclusion: Using computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect cardiac conditions from photos of ECGs taken with smartphones is feasible. This platform can enable widespread deployment of the latest machine learning-based ECG diagnostic algorithms.\nVentricular volume asymmetry as a novel imaging biomarker for disease discrimination and outcome prediction\nAuthors: McCracken, C.; Szabo, L.; Abdulelah, Z. A.; Vago, H.; Nichols, T.; Petersen, S. E.; Neubauer, S.; Raisi-Estabragh, Z.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298024\nBackground: The utility of ventricular asymmetry as an imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk has not been assessed in population cohorts. Objectives: This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the population distribution of ventricular asymmetry and its relationships across a range of prevalent and incident cardiorespiratory diseases. Methods: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging metrics derived from automated image analysis were examined, along with clinical outcomes ascertained through linked health records. Ventricular asymmetry was expressed as the ratio of left and right ventricular (LV, RV) end-diastolic volumes. The normal range for ventricular symmetry was defined in a healthy subset without cardiorespiratory disease. Participants with values outside the 5th-95th percentiles of the healthy distribution were classed as either LV dominant (LV/RV \u003e 112%) or RV dominant (LV/RV \u003c 80%) asymmetry. Associations of LV and RV dominant asymmetry with vascular risk factors, CMR features, and prevalent and incident cardiovascular diseases were examined using regression models, adjusting for vascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and conventional CMR measures. Results: The analysis includes 44,796 participants (average age 64.1, SD 7.7 years; 51.9% women). Ventricular asymmetry, in either direction, was associated with older age and adverse cardiovascular remodeling. LV-dominance was linked to an array of pre-existing vascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases, and a two-fold increased risk of incident heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Ventricular asymmetry has clinical utility for cardiovascular risk assessment, providing information that is incremental to traditional risk factors and conventional CMR metrics.\nLow density neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are new inflammatory players in heart failure\nAuthors: Dumont, B. L.; Neagoe, P.-E.; Charles, E.; Villeneuve, L. R.; Ninni, S.; Tardif, J.-C.; Räkel, A.; White, M.; Sirois, M. G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298072\nBackground: Heart failure with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation. Circulating neutrophils regroup two subtypes termed high- and low-density neutrophils (HDNs and LDNs). LDNs represent less than 2% of total neutrophil under physiological conditions, but their count increase in multiple pathologies, releasing more inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Objectives: Assess the differential count and role of HDNs, LDNs and NETs-related activities in HF patients. Methods: HDNs and LDNs were isolated from human blood by density gradient and purified by FACS and their counts obtained by flow cytometry. NETs formation (NETosis) was quantified by confocal microscopy. Circulating inflammatory and NETosis biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Neutrophil adhesion onto human extracellular matrix (hECM) was assessed by optical microscopy. Results: A total of 140 individuals were enrolled, including 33 healthy volunteers (HV), 41 HFrEF (19 stable patients and 22 presenting acute decompensated HF; ADHF) and 66 HFpEF patients (36 stable patients and 30 presenting HF decompensation). HDNs and LDNs counts were significantly increased up to 39% and 2740% respectively in HF patients compared to HV. In HF patients, the correlations between LDNs counts and circulating inflammatory (CRP, IL-6 and -8), Troponin T, NT-proBNP and NETosis components were all significant. In vitro, LDNs expressed more H3Cit and NETs and were more pro-adhesive, with ADHFpEF patients presenting the highest pro-inflammatory profile. Conclusions: HFpEF patients present higher levels of circulating LDNs and NETs related activities, which are the highest in the context of acute HF decompensation.\nIntegrating metabolomics and proteomics to identify novel drug targets for heart failure and atrial fibrillation\nAuthors: van Vugt, M.; Finan, C.; Chopade, S.; Providencia, R.; Bezzina, C. R.; Asselbergs, F. W.; van Setten, J.; Schmidt, A. F.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297247\nBackgroundAltered metabolism plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). We aimed to identify novel plasma metabolites and proteins associating with cardiac disease. MethodsMendelian randomisation (MR) was used to assess the association of 174 metabolites measured in up to 86,507 participants with AF, HF, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Subsequently, we sourced data on 1,567 plasma proteins and performed cis MR to identify proteins affecting the identified metabolites as well as the cardiac diseases. Proteins were prioritised on cardiac expression and druggability, and mapped to biological pathways. ResultsWe identified 35 metabolites associating with cardiac disease. AF was affected by seventeen metabolites, HF by nineteen, DCM by four, and NCIM by taurine. HF was particularly enriched for phosphatidylcholines (p=0.029) and DCM for acylcarnitines (p=0.001). Metabolite involvement with AF was more uniform, spanning for example phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines. We identified 38 druggable proteins expressed in cardiac tissue, with a directionally concordant effect on metabolites and cardiac disease. We recapitulated known associations, for example between the drug target of digoxin (AT1B2), taurine and NICM risk. Additionally, we identified numerous novel findings, such as higher RET values associating with phosphatidylcholines and decreasing AF and HF, and RET is targeted by drugs such as regorafenib which has known cardiotoxic side-effects. Pathway analysis implicated involvement of GDF15 signalling through RET, and ghrelin regulation of energy homeostasis in cardiac pathogenesis. ConclusionThis study identified 35 plasma metabolites involved with cardiac diseases and linked these to 38 druggable proteins, providing actionable leads for drug development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Metabolomic platforms using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can now rapidly quantify many circulating metabolites which are potential biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we analyse [~]170,000 UK Biobank participants (5,096 incident CVD cases) without a history of CVD and not on lipid-lowering treatments to evaluate the potential for improving 10-year CVD risk prediction using NMR biomarkers in addition to conventional risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Using machine learning, we developed sex-specific NMR scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, then estimated their incremental improvement of 10-year CVD risk prediction when added to guideline-recommended risk prediction models (i.e., SCORE2) with and without PRSs. The risk discrimination provided by SCORE2 (Harrells C-index = 0.718) was similarly improved by addition of NMR scores ({Delta}C-index 0.011; 0.009, 0.014) and PRSs ({Delta}C-index 0.009; 95% CI: 0.007, 0.012), which offered largely orthogonal information. Addition of both NMR scores and PRSs yielded the largest improvement in C-index over SCORE2, from 0.718 to 0.737 ({Delta}C-index 0.019; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.022). Concomitant improvements in risk stratification were observed in categorical net reclassification index when using guidelines-recommended risk categorisation, with net case reclassification of 13.04% (95% CI: 11.67%, 14.41%) when adding both NMR scores and PRSs to SCORE2. Using population modelling, we estimated that targeted risk-reclassification with NMR scores and PRSs together could increase the number of CVD events prevented per 100,000 screened from 201 to 370 ({Delta}CVDprevented: 170; 95% CI: 158, 182) while essentially maintaining the number of statins prescribed per CVD event prevented. Overall, we show combining NMR scores and PRSs with SCORE2 moderately enhances prediction of first-onset CVD, and could have substantial population health benefit if applied at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individuals risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors as well as tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score, and quantify the under-diagnosis of women compared to men. Strikingly, for first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that, out of the top 10 features across three sex and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40-50%, electrocardiogram 30-33%, pulse wave analysis 13-23%, and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound 0-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWeb-based risk prediction tools for cardiovascular diseases are crucial for providing rapid risk estimates for busy clinicians, but there is none available specifically for Chinese subjects. This study developed ChineseCVD, first-in-world web-based Chinese-specific Cardiovascular Risk Calculator incorporating long COVID, COVID-19 vaccination, SGLT2i and PCSK9i treatment effects.

MethodsAdult patients attending government-funded family medicine clinics in Hong Kong between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003 were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, transient ischaemic attacks/ischaemic strokes, and cardiovascular mortality.

ResultsA total of 155,066 patients were used as the derivation cohort. Over a median follow-up of 16.1 (11.6-17.8) years, 31,061 (20.44%) had MACE. Cox regression identified male gender, age, comorbidities, cardiovascular medications, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and laboratory test results (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, ALP, AST, ALT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglyceride, LDL and HDL) as significant predictors of the above outcomes. ChineseCVD further incorporates the impact of smoking status, COVID-19 infection, number of COVID-19 vaccination doses, and modifier effects of newest medication classes of PCSK9i and SGLT2i. The calculator enables clinicians to demonstrate to patients how risks vary with different medications.

ConclusionsThe ChineseCVD risk calculator enables rapid web-based risk assessment for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making at the bedside or in the clinic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate cardiac effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of echocardiography-assessment and biomarkers.

MethodsThis is an observational study of the first patients admitted to intensive care due to SARS-CoV-2-respiratory failure. Thirty-four underwent echocardiography of which twenty-five were included, compared to forty-four non-echo patients. Exclusion was based on absence of normofrequent sinus rhythm and/or mechanical respiratory support. Biomarkers were analysed on clinical indication.

ResultsMortality was higher in the echo-compared to non-echo group (44 % vs. 16%, p&lt;0.05). Right-sided parameters were not under significant strain. Tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicated how increased pulmonary pressure was associated with mortality (survivors: 2.51 {&#43;/-} 0.01 m/s vs. non-survivors: 3.06 {&#43;/-} 0.11 m/s, p&lt;0.05), before multiple comparison-correction. Setting cut-off for pulmonary hypertension to 2.8 m/s generated p&lt;0.01 using frequency distribution testing. Cardiac markers, high sensitivity cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were higher in the echocardiography group. (hs-TnI (ng/L): echo : 133 {&#43;/-} 45 vs. non-echo: 81.3 {&#43;/-} 45, p&lt;0.01; NT-proBNP (ng/L): echo: 2959 {&#43;/-} 573 vs. non-echo: 1641 {&#43;/-} 420, p&lt;0.001; D-dimer (mg/L): echo: 16.1 {&#43;/-} 3.7 vs. non-echo: 6.1 {&#43;/-} 1.5, p&lt;0.01) and non-survivor group (hs-TnI (ng/L): survivors: 59.1 {&#43;/-} 21 vs. non-survivors: 211 {&#43;/-} 105, p&lt;0.0001; NT-proBNP (ng/L): survivors: 1310 {&#43;/-} 314 vs. non-survivors: 4065 {&#43;/-} 740, p&lt;0.0001; D-dimer (mg/L): survivors: 7.2 {&#43;/-} 1.5 vs. non-survivors: 17.1 {&#43;/-} 4.8, p&lt;0.01). Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was positively correlated with cardiac troponin I (r=0.93, r2=0.74, p&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsThese results suggest there is no negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary pressure appears higher amongst non-survivors indicating pulmonary disease as the driver of mortality. Echocardiography was more commonly performed in the non-survivor group, and cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer was higher in the non-survivor group suggesting they carry negative prognostic values.

Trial registration numberThis is an observational study from patients included in &#34;Clinical trials NCT04316884&#34;

Strength and limitations of this study- The patient cohort is recruited from consecutive patients admitted to the ICU in need of mechanical respiratory support independent of background which makes it relevant to clinical practice.
- The echocardiographic image acquisition was carried out by hospital assigned agents on clinical indication, which makes the results applicable in a clinical setting.
- Since the image acquisition was carried out on a clinical indication, the results may be skewed towards the false positive if applied to all Covid19 patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Artificial intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic algorithms can achieve cardiologist-level accuracy, but their clinical use is limited as they cannot be installed in older ECG machines. Objective: To develop a smartphone application that extracts and analyzes ECG waveforms from photos using machine learning techniques. Methods: A smartphone application was developed to automatically extract ECG waveforms from photos taken by clinicians using computer vision and machine learning. Custom designed machine learning models were developed to perform waveform identification, gridline removal, and scale calibration. The extracted voltage-time series waveforms were analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning-based diagnostic algorithms, and the accuracy of the proof-of-concept application was assessed. Results: Waveforms from 40,516 scanned and 444 photographed ECGs were automatically extracted. 12,828 of 13,258 (96.8%) scanned and 5,399 of 5,743 (94.0%) photographed waveforms were correctly cropped and labelled. 11,604 of 12,735 (91.1%) scanned and 5,062 of 5,752 (88.0%) photographed waveforms achieved successful voltage-time signal extraction after automatic gridline and background noise removal. The AF diagnostic algorithm achieved 91.3% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity, 95.6% positive predictive value, 88.6% negative predictive value and 93.4% F1 score. Conclusion: Using computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect cardiac conditions from photos of ECGs taken with smartphones is feasible. This platform can enable widespread deployment of the latest machine learning-based ECG diagnostic algorithms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The utility of ventricular asymmetry as an imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk has not been assessed in population cohorts. Objectives: This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the population distribution of ventricular asymmetry and its relationships across a range of prevalent and incident cardiorespiratory diseases. Methods: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging metrics derived from automated image analysis were examined, along with clinical outcomes ascertained through linked health records. Ventricular asymmetry was expressed as the ratio of left and right ventricular (LV, RV) end-diastolic volumes. The normal range for ventricular symmetry was defined in a healthy subset without cardiorespiratory disease. Participants with values outside the 5th-95th percentiles of the healthy distribution were classed as either LV dominant (LV/RV &gt; 112%) or RV dominant (LV/RV &lt; 80%) asymmetry. Associations of LV and RV dominant asymmetry with vascular risk factors, CMR features, and prevalent and incident cardiovascular diseases were examined using regression models, adjusting for vascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and conventional CMR measures. Results: The analysis includes 44,796 participants (average age 64.1, SD 7.7 years; 51.9% women). Ventricular asymmetry, in either direction, was associated with older age and adverse cardiovascular remodeling. LV-dominance was linked to an array of pre-existing vascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases, and a two-fold increased risk of incident heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, and left-sided valvular disorders. RV dominance was associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Ventricular asymmetry has clinical utility for cardiovascular risk assessment, providing information that is incremental to traditional risk factors and conventional CMR metrics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Heart failure with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation. Circulating neutrophils regroup two subtypes termed high- and low-density neutrophils (HDNs and LDNs). LDNs represent less than 2% of total neutrophil under physiological conditions, but their count increase in multiple pathologies, releasing more inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Objectives: Assess the differential count and role of HDNs, LDNs and NETs-related activities in HF patients. Methods: HDNs and LDNs were isolated from human blood by density gradient and purified by FACS and their counts obtained by flow cytometry. NETs formation (NETosis) was quantified by confocal microscopy. Circulating inflammatory and NETosis biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Neutrophil adhesion onto human extracellular matrix (hECM) was assessed by optical microscopy. Results: A total of 140 individuals were enrolled, including 33 healthy volunteers (HV), 41 HFrEF (19 stable patients and 22 presenting acute decompensated HF; ADHF) and 66 HFpEF patients (36 stable patients and 30 presenting HF decompensation). HDNs and LDNs counts were significantly increased up to 39% and 2740% respectively in HF patients compared to HV. In HF patients, the correlations between LDNs counts and circulating inflammatory (CRP, IL-6 and -8), Troponin T, NT-proBNP and NETosis components were all significant. In vitro, LDNs expressed more H3Cit and NETs and were more pro-adhesive, with ADHFpEF patients presenting the highest pro-inflammatory profile. Conclusions: HFpEF patients present higher levels of circulating LDNs and NETs related activities, which are the highest in the context of acute HF decompensation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAltered metabolism plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). We aimed to identify novel plasma metabolites and proteins associating with cardiac disease.

MethodsMendelian randomisation (MR) was used to assess the association of 174 metabolites measured in up to 86,507 participants with AF, HF, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Subsequently, we sourced data on 1,567 plasma proteins and performed cis MR to identify proteins affecting the identified metabolites as well as the cardiac diseases. Proteins were prioritised on cardiac expression and druggability, and mapped to biological pathways.

ResultsWe identified 35 metabolites associating with cardiac disease. AF was affected by seventeen metabolites, HF by nineteen, DCM by four, and NCIM by taurine. HF was particularly enriched for phosphatidylcholines (p=0.029) and DCM for acylcarnitines (p=0.001). Metabolite involvement with AF was more uniform, spanning for example phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines. We identified 38 druggable proteins expressed in cardiac tissue, with a directionally concordant effect on metabolites and cardiac disease. We recapitulated known associations, for example between the drug target of digoxin (AT1B2), taurine and NICM risk. Additionally, we identified numerous novel findings, such as higher RET values associating with phosphatidylcholines and decreasing AF and HF, and RET is targeted by drugs such as regorafenib which has known cardiotoxic side-effects. Pathway analysis implicated involvement of GDF15 signalling through RET, and ghrelin regulation of energy homeostasis in cardiac pathogenesis.

ConclusionThis study identified 35 plasma metabolites involved with cardiac diseases and linked these to 38 druggable proteins, providing actionable leads for drug development.</p>
