MethodsComprehensive details, encompassing the first authors name, publication year, sample inclusion criteria, sample size, and demographic characteristics, including age and gender of participants, were systematically extracted from all incorporated studies. Meanwhile, the analysis encompassed the assessment of the risk associated with nineteen cardiovascular outcomes. ResultsA total of 3, 201 potentially eligible studies were initially identified for consideration. Following rigorous literature screening and quality control measures, eighteen studies, encompassing 46, 083, 975 patients, met the specified criteria. In comparison to the control cohort, our investigation unveiled a heightened risk of 19 cardiovascular outcomes associated with long COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55-1.81) (I2 = 69.1%, p= 0.000) for the overall risk of cardiovascular outcomes, indicating an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals affected by long COVID-19. While the heterogeneity was relatively high, it is essential to acknowledge that all studies inherently carry an unavoidable risk of bias, irrespective of their quality rating. Moreover, there appears to be no significant publication bias based on the funnel plot, Beggs, and Eggers tests. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal substantial alterations in the overall stability of the results. ConclusionsOur meta-analysis substantiates that individuals afflicted with long COVID-19 face an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Routine assessment of cardiac function is deemed essential for a long COVID-19 high-risk cardiovascular disease population. Timely interventions have the potential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated mortality in this population.

M.; Tamlander, M.; Hlushchenko, I.; Ripatti, S.; Pfisterer, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299827\nAimsLack of functional information for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mutations limits the use of genetics for early diagnosis, risk assessment and clinical decision making in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem. MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression. Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (\"Loss-of-function\", 0-10% activity; \"defective\", 10-30%; \"mildly-defective\", 30-70%; and \"non-defective\", \u003e 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants. ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making. Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.\nRiluzole is Associated With Reduced Risk of Heart Failure\nAuthors: KIM, K.; Kim, S.; Katana, M.; Terentyev, D.; Radwanski, P. B.; Munger, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300552\nBackground: Reduction of intracellular Na+ accumulation through late Na+ current inhibition has been recognized as a target for cardiac Ca2+ handling which underlies myocardial contractility and relaxation in heart failure (HF). Riluzole, a Na+ channel blocker with enhancement of Ca2+ activated K+ channel function, used for management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is effective in suppressing Ca2+ leak and therefore may improve cardiac function. Objectives: The study aim was to investigate whether riluzole lowers HF incidence. Methods: Rates of HF incident were compared using a commercial insurance and Medicare supplement claims databases. Patients with a filled riluzole prescription (treatment) between 06/2009 and 12/2019 were compared to those with no riluzole (control). We excluded HF patients during the 180 day baseline period. Study endpoint was the first HF diagnosis from the index riluzole prescription or ALS diagnosis. HF onset was compared between the propensity score matched treatment and control cohorts. Results: The matched cohort consisted of 4,060 pairs of riluzole/control patients. The 24 month cumulative incidence of HF onset for riluzole vs. control patients was 4.96% vs. 7.27%, calculating hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI, p value] of 0.55 [0.40 to 0.76, p\u003c0.01]. The HR estimates favoring riluzole over the ALS control were consistent across the 3 months to 2 year follow up. The clinically and statistically significant effect on HF onset was driven by the lower rate of HFrEF with the 2 year HR [95% CI] of 0.46 [0.21 to 0.99]. Conclusions: Riluzole is associated with a lower rate of HF onset, suggesting a potential prevention strategy for early management.\nLeft ventricular trabecular layer operates at high ejection fraction: implications for pump function assessment in excessive trabeculation\nAuthors: Visoiu, I. S.; Rimbas, R. C.; Nicula, A. I.; Vinereanu, D.; Jensen, B.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300719\nAimsNumerous diagnostic criteria for excessive trabeculation (ET), or so-called \"noncompaction\", score the extent of the trabecular layer, yet whether the trabeculations themselves have a negative or positive impact on pump function is largely unknown. This study aimed to measure the ejection fraction (EF) of the trabecular layer and its impact on pump function assessment. Methods and resultsWe retrospectively analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in patients with ET of the left ventricle (LV). The LV was labelled into four regions: compact wall, central cavity (CC), trabeculations, and intertrabecular recesses (IR). For each label we calculated the systolic fractional volume change (SFVC) in short-axis images (n=15) and systolic fractional area change (SFAC) in 4-chamber images (n=30), by dividing end-systolic to end-diastolic values. We measured the EF of IR, CC, and total cavity (TC). Three methods to calculate EF of the TC were compared: trabeculations included (per guidelines), IR excluded (Jacquier criterion), trabeculations contoured and excluded (contour-EF). The SFVC and SFAC of the compact wall were similar with SFVC and SFAC of trabeculations (both P\u003e0.05). In contrast, the IR were more diminished in systole by comparison with the CC, having lower SFVC (39{+/-}17% vs. 56{+/-}16%, P\u003c0.001) and SFAC (37{+/-}22% vs. 72{+/-}12%, P\u003c0.001). EF of the IR was also greater than EF of the CC (61{+/-}17% vs. 44{+/-}16%, P\u003c0.001). Excluding IR from the TC or including trabeculations underestimates the contour-EF (44{+/-}16% and 40{+/-}12%, respectively, vs. 51{+/-}16%; both P\u003c0.001). ConclusionsThe trabecular layer has a high EF. Values of key prognostic indicators are better when this is accounted for.

        <p class="abstract">AimsLack of functional information for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mutations limits the use of genetics for early diagnosis, risk assessment and clinical decision making in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The goal of this study was an in-depth and large-scale functional characterization of LDLR variants to overcome this problem.

MethodsOpen-source robotic tools were integrated with multiplexed high-content microscopy, image and data analysis into a novel semi-automated analysis pipeline for the characterization of LDLR variants to quantify LDL uptake, LDLR localization and expression.

Results315 LDLR coding variants were functionally characterized in this study and collapsed into four functional groups based on their residual LDL uptake activity (&#34;Loss-of-function&#34;, 0-10% activity; &#34;defective&#34;, 10-30%; &#34;mildly-defective&#34;, 30-70%; and &#34;non-defective&#34;, &gt; 90%). Integration of the activity groups with whole-exome sequencing and clinical data from UK biobank demonstrated that considering LDLR activity levels improved risk assessment in dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals carrying LDLR variants from the loss-of-function and defective groups displayed increased odds ratios for CVD (OR=6.1, 95% CI = 1.5 - 24.4; OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.7) as compared to the non-defective group. Also, plasma LDL-cholesterol, utilization of lipid-lowering drugs and combination therapy were higher in the loss-of-function (OR = 15.4, 95% CI = 3.8 - 61.7; OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.8 - 31.8; OR = 96.8, 95% CI = 22.6 - 414.1), defective (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 4.1 - 8.6; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.5 - 4.9; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 8.4 - 29.1) and mildly-defective group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 - 2.7; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6 - 2.4; OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 - 3.4) as compared to the non-defective group. Especially, the loss-of-function group displayed higher CVD risk, increased LDL-C and combination therapy usage as compared to the ClinVar pathogenic group for the same subjects. Furthermore, the functional data indicates that prediction tools tend to overestimate the fraction of pathogenic LDLR variants.

ConclusionSystematic functional data for LDLR variants paves the way for improved diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment optimization for FH patients, enabling a better utilization of genetic data in clinical decision making.

Translational perspectiveA loss-of-function LDLR variant leads to lifelong exposure of elevated LDL-C. Whilst sequencing of the LDLR gene is included in the genetic assessment of FH patients, most LDLR variants lack information about functional consequences at the cellular level. This limits the utility of genetic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of FH. This study overcomes this problem, providing functional information for a large set of LDLR variants. Integration with genetic and clinical data from UK biobank enables links between functional and clinical effects, making it easier to diagnose FH and estimate a patients cardiovascular risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Reduction of intracellular Na&#43; accumulation through late Na&#43; current inhibition has been recognized as a target for cardiac Ca2&#43; handling which underlies myocardial contractility and relaxation in heart failure (HF). Riluzole, a Na&#43; channel blocker with enhancement of Ca2&#43; activated K&#43; channel function, used for management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is effective in suppressing Ca2&#43; leak and therefore may improve cardiac function. Objectives: The study aim was to investigate whether riluzole lowers HF incidence. Methods: Rates of HF incident were compared using a commercial insurance and Medicare supplement claims databases. Patients with a filled riluzole prescription (treatment) between 06/2009 and 12/2019 were compared to those with no riluzole (control). We excluded HF patients during the 180 day baseline period. Study endpoint was the first HF diagnosis from the index riluzole prescription or ALS diagnosis. HF onset was compared between the propensity score matched treatment and control cohorts. Results: The matched cohort consisted of 4,060 pairs of riluzole/control patients. The 24 month cumulative incidence of HF onset for riluzole vs. control patients was 4.96% vs. 7.27%, calculating hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI, p value] of 0.55 [0.40 to 0.76, p&lt;0.01]. The HR estimates favoring riluzole over the ALS control were consistent across the 3 months to 2 year follow up. The clinically and statistically significant effect on HF onset was driven by the lower rate of HFrEF with the 2 year HR [95% CI] of 0.46 [0.21 to 0.99]. Conclusions: Riluzole is associated with a lower rate of HF onset, suggesting a potential prevention strategy for early management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimsNumerous diagnostic criteria for excessive trabeculation (ET), or so-called &#34;noncompaction&#34;, score the extent of the trabecular layer, yet whether the trabeculations themselves have a negative or positive impact on pump function is largely unknown. This study aimed to measure the ejection fraction (EF) of the trabecular layer and its impact on pump function assessment.

Methods and resultsWe retrospectively analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in patients with ET of the left ventricle (LV). The LV was labelled into four regions: compact wall, central cavity (CC), trabeculations, and intertrabecular recesses (IR). For each label we calculated the systolic fractional volume change (SFVC) in short-axis images (n=15) and systolic fractional area change (SFAC) in 4-chamber images (n=30), by dividing end-systolic to end-diastolic values. We measured the EF of IR, CC, and total cavity (TC). Three methods to calculate EF of the TC were compared: trabeculations included (per guidelines), IR excluded (Jacquier criterion), trabeculations contoured and excluded (contour-EF).

The SFVC and SFAC of the compact wall were similar with SFVC and SFAC of trabeculations (both P&gt;0.05). In contrast, the IR were more diminished in systole by comparison with the CC, having lower SFVC (39{&#43;/-}17% vs. 56{&#43;/-}16%, P&lt;0.001) and SFAC (37{&#43;/-}22% vs. 72{&#43;/-}12%, P&lt;0.001). EF of the IR was also greater than EF of the CC (61{&#43;/-}17% vs. 44{&#43;/-}16%, P&lt;0.001). Excluding IR from the TC or including trabeculations underestimates the contour-EF (44{&#43;/-}16% and 40{&#43;/-}12%, respectively, vs. 51{&#43;/-}16%; both P&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsThe trabecular layer has a high EF. Values of key prognostic indicators are better when this is accounted for.
