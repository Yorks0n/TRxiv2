M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301213\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD), primarily coronary heart disease and stroke, rank amongst the leading causes of long-term disability and mortality. Providing accurate disease risk predictions and identifying genes associated with CVD are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and the development of novel medications. The recent availability of UK Biobank Proteomics data enables the investigation of the blood proteome and its association with a wide variety of diseases. We employed the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), an interpretable machine learning model, for CVD risk prediction. The EBM model using proteomics outperforms traditional clinical models with an AUROC of 0.767 and an AUPRC of 0.2405. Adding clinical features further improves the AUROC to 0.785 and the AUPRC to 0.2835. Our models demonstrate consistent performance across sexes and ethnicities. While most prior studies using proteomics data for disease prediction have primarily focused on maximizing the accuracy at the population level, our model provides additional enriched insights into individualized disease risk predictions and in-depth biological insights into biomarkers. Our analysis also uncovers nonlinear risks linked to varying feature values. We further corroborate our findings using statistical approaches and evidence from the literature. In conclusion, we present a highly accurate and explanatory framework for proteomics data analysis, offering comprehensive and in-depth molecular and clinical insights. Our findings support future approaches that prioritize individualized disease risk prediction and the identification of target genes for drug development.\nAlcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: do sex, mitral valve leaflet length and septal thickness affect the outcome?\nAuthors: Mustafic, M.; Jander, R.; Marlevi, D.; Rickenlund, A.; Ruck, A.; Saleh, N.; Abdi, S.; Eriksson, M. J.; Damlin, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301419\nPurposeThis retrospective cohort study aimed to assess whether basal septal wall thickness (BSWT), anterior (AML) and posterior (PML) mitral leaflet length, or sex were associated with remaining left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA). Methods154 patients that underwent ASA at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, between 2009 and 2021, were retrospectively included. Anatomical and hemodynamic parameters were collected from invasive catheterization before and during ASA, and from echocardiography (ECHO) examinations before, during, and at one-year follow-up after ASA. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between sex, BSWT, AML, PML, and outcome defined as remaining LVOTO (\u003e30 mmHg) after ASA. ResultsThe median follow-up was 364 days (IQR 334-385 days). BSWT \u003e23 mm (n=13, 12%) was associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up (p=0.004). Elongated MVLL (either AML or PML) was present in 125 (90%) of the patients. Elongated AML (\u003e24 mm) was present in 67 (44%) of the patients, although AML length was not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. Elongated PML (\u003e14 mm) was present in 114 (74%) and not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. No significant sex differences were observed regarding remaining LVOTO. ConclusionECHO measurement of BSWT can be used effectively for patient selection for successful ASA and for identification of patients with a risk of incomplete resolution of LVOTO after ASA.\nOverweight followed by obesity have the lowest mortality among patients with systolic or diastolic heart failure independent of comorbidities whereas cachexia has the highest mortality.\nAuthors: Movahed, M. R. R.; Mineer, A.; Hashemzadeh, M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24300813\nIntroduction: A phenomenon known as the obesity paradox has been reported in patients with heart failure (HF) suggesting lower mortality with increasing weight. The goal of this study is to characterize this observation in HF using the largest available inpatient database of adult patients. Method: We searched the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for patients for the years 2016-2020 with a diagnosis of systolic (SHF) or diastolic heart failure (DHF) using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes. We evaluated mortality association based on body weight. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to adjust all-cause inpatient mortality for comorbidities. Results: There was a total of 7,364,023 patients with a diagnosis of SHF and 10,064,223 patients with a diagnosis of DHF. All-cause inpatient mortality was lowest in overweight patients followed by those with obesity and morbid obesity, whereas mortality was highest in cachexia compared to normal weight for SHF and DHF patients (mortality: overweight 2.56%, obese 3.12%, morbidly obese 3.70%, normal weight 5.60%, and cachexia 15.22%; p\u003c0.001) and DHF patients (mortality: overweight 2.08%, obese 2.43%, morbidly obese 2.93%, normal weight 4.58%, and cachexia 14.25%; p\u003c0.001). This relationship remains similar after multivariate analysis. (SHF patients: overweight OR: 0.49 (0.41-0.58), obesity OR: 0.64 (0.62-0.66), morbid obesity OR: 0.85 (0.83-0.88), and cachexia OR: 2.78 (2.67-2.90); p\u003c0.001; DHF patients: overweight OR: 0.47 (0.40-0.56), obesity OR: 0.61 (0.59-0.63), morbid obesity OR: 0.83 (0.81-0.85), and cachexia OR: 3.09 (2.96-3.23); p\u003c0.001). Conclusion: Our data observed that all-cause inpatient mortality in SHF and DHF is lowest in overweight populations followed by obese and morbidly obese populations whereas cachexia has the highest mortality. However, increasing weight above the overweight reduces the obesity paradox benefit.\nTitin-Truncating variants Predispose to Dilated Cardiomyopathy in Diverse Populations\nAuthors: DePaolo, J.; Bornstein, M.; Judy, R.; Abramowitz, S.; Verma, S. S.; Levin, M.; Arany, Z.; Damrauer, S. M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301405\nImportanceThe effect of high percentage spliced in (hiPSI) TTN truncating variants (TTNtvs) on risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has historically been studied among population subgroups defined by genetic similarity to European reference populations. This has raised questions about the effect of TTNtvs in diverse populations, especially among individuals genetically similar to African reference populations. ObjectiveTo determine the effect of TTNtvs on risk of DCM in diverse population as measured by genetic distance (GD) in principal component (PC) space. DesignCohort study SettingPenn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) is a large, diverse biobank. ParticipantsParticipants were recruited from across the Penn Medicine healthcare system and volunteered to have their electronic health records linked to biospecimen data including DNA which has undergone whole exome sequencing. Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisk of DCM among individuals carrying a hiPSI TTNtv. ResultsCarrying a hiPSI TTNtv was associated with DCM among PMBB participants across a range of GD deciles from the 1000G European centroid; the effect estimates ranged from odds ratio (OR) = 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 8.56) to OR = 9.39 (95% CI 3.82 to 23.13). When individuals were assigned to population subgroups based on genetic similarity to the 1000G reference populations, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred significant risk of DCM among those genetically similar to the 1000G European reference population (OR = 7.55, 95% CI 4.99 to 11.42, P\u003c0.001) and individuals genetically similar to the 1000G African reference population (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 8.24, P=0.004). Conclusions and RelevanceTTNtvs are associated with increased risk of DCM among a diverse cohort. There is no significant difference in effect of TTNtvs on DCM risk across deciles of GD from the 1000G European centroid, suggesting genetic background should not be considered when screening individuals for titin-related DCM. Key Points QuestionDo high percentage spliced in (hiPSI) titin truncating variants (TTNtvs) confer similar levels of risk for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) across diverse populations? FindingsIn a cohort study that comprised 43,731 individuals of diverse genetic background with electronic health records linked to whole exome sequencing data, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred increased risk of DCM across all individuals irrespective of genetic background as measured by genetic distance from the 1000 Genomes Project European centroid. MeaningThe findings of this study suggest that TTNtvs increase risk of DCM among individuals independent of genetic background and that genetic similarity to a reference population should not play a role in screening for genetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy.\nComprehensive Evaluation of Clonal Hematopoiesis and Mosaic Loss of Y Chromosome in Cardiovascular Risk: A Thorough Analysis in prospective studies\nAuthors: Fawaz, S.; Marti, S.; Dufossee, M.; Pucheu, Y.; Gaufroy, A.; Broitman, J.; Bidet, A.; Soumare, A.; Munsch, G.; Christophe, T.; Debette, S.; Tregouet, D.-A.; James, C.; Mansier, O.; Couffinhal, T.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.24301313\nBackgroundClonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was initially linked to a twofold increase in atherothrombotic events. However, recent investigations have revealed a more nuanced picture, suggesting that CHIP may confer only a modest rise in Myocardial Infarction (MI) risk. This observed lower risk might be influenced by yet unidentified factors that modulate the pathological effects of CHIP. Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY), a common marker of clonal hematopoiesis in men, has emerged as a potential candidate for modulating cardiovascular risk associated with CHIP. In this comprehensive study, we aimed to ascertain the precise risk linked to each somatic mutation or mLOY and explore whether mLOY could exert an influence on the cardiovascular risk associated with CHIP. MethodsWe conducted a meticulous examination for the presence of CHIP and mLOY using targeted high-throughput sequencing and digital PCR in a cohort of 446 individuals. Among them, 149 patients from the CHAth study had experienced a first myocardial infarction (MI) at the time of inclusion (MI(+) subjects), while 297 individuals from the 3-city cohort had no history of cardiovascular events (CVE) at the time of inclusion (MI(-) subjects). All subjects underwent thorough cardiovascular phenotyping, including a direct assessment of atherosclerotic burden. Our investigation aimed to determine whether mLOY could modulate inflammation, atherosclerosis burden, and atherothrombotic risk associated with CHIP. ResultsCHIP and mLOY were detected with a substantial prevalence (45.1% and 37.7%, respectively), and their occurrence was similar between MI(+) and MI(-) subjects. Notably, nearly 40% of CHIP(+) male subjects also exhibited mLOY. Interestingly, neither CHIP nor mLOY independently resulted in significant increases in plasma hsCRP levels, atherosclerotic burden, or MI incidence. Moreover, mLOY did not amplify or diminish inflammation, atherosclerosis, or MI incidence among CHIP(+) male subjects. Conversely, inMI(-) male subjects, CHIP heightened the risk of MI over a five-year period, particularly in those lacking mLOY. ConclusionOur study highlights the high prevalence of CHIP and mLOY in elderly individuals. Importantly, our results demonstrate that neither CHIP nor mLOY in isolation substantially contribute to inflammation, atherosclerosis, or MI incidence. Furthermore, we find that mLOY does not exert a significant influence on the modulation of inflammation, atherosclerosis burden, or atherothrombotic risk associated with CHIP. However, CHIP may accelerate the occurrence of MI, especially when unaccompanied by mLOY. These findings underscore the complexity of the interplay between CHIP, mLOY, and cardiovascular risk, suggesting that large-scale studies with thousands more patients may be necessary to elucidate subtle correlations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), primarily coronary heart disease and stroke, rank amongst the leading causes of long-term disability and mortality. Providing accurate disease risk predictions and identifying genes associated with CVD are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and the development of novel medications.

The recent availability of UK Biobank Proteomics data enables the investigation of the blood proteome and its association with a wide variety of diseases. We employed the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), an interpretable machine learning model, for CVD risk prediction. The EBM model using proteomics outperforms traditional clinical models with an AUROC of 0.767 and an AUPRC of 0.2405. Adding clinical features further improves the AUROC to 0.785 and the AUPRC to 0.2835. Our models demonstrate consistent performance across sexes and ethnicities.

While most prior studies using proteomics data for disease prediction have primarily focused on maximizing the accuracy at the population level, our model provides additional enriched insights into individualized disease risk predictions and in-depth biological insights into biomarkers. Our analysis also uncovers nonlinear risks linked to varying feature values. We further corroborate our findings using statistical approaches and evidence from the literature.

In conclusion, we present a highly accurate and explanatory framework for proteomics data analysis, offering comprehensive and in-depth molecular and clinical insights. Our findings support future approaches that prioritize individualized disease risk prediction and the identification of target genes for drug development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThis retrospective cohort study aimed to assess whether basal septal wall thickness (BSWT), anterior (AML) and posterior (PML) mitral leaflet length, or sex were associated with remaining left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA).

Methods154 patients that underwent ASA at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, between 2009 and 2021, were retrospectively included. Anatomical and hemodynamic parameters were collected from invasive catheterization before and during ASA, and from echocardiography (ECHO) examinations before, during, and at one-year follow-up after ASA. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between sex, BSWT, AML, PML, and outcome defined as remaining LVOTO (&gt;30 mmHg) after ASA.

ResultsThe median follow-up was 364 days (IQR 334-385 days). BSWT &gt;23 mm (n=13, 12%) was associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up (p=0.004). Elongated MVLL (either AML or PML) was present in 125 (90%) of the patients. Elongated AML (&gt;24 mm) was present in 67 (44%) of the patients, although AML length was not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. Elongated PML (&gt;14 mm) was present in 114 (74%) and not associated with remaining LVOTO at follow-up. No significant sex differences were observed regarding remaining LVOTO.

ConclusionECHO measurement of BSWT can be used effectively for patient selection for successful ASA and for identification of patients with a risk of incomplete resolution of LVOTO after ASA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: A phenomenon known as the obesity paradox has been reported in patients with heart failure (HF) suggesting lower mortality with increasing weight. The goal of this study is to characterize this observation in HF using the largest available inpatient database of adult patients. Method: We searched the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for patients for the years 2016-2020 with a diagnosis of systolic (SHF) or diastolic heart failure (DHF) using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes. We evaluated mortality association based on body weight. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to adjust all-cause inpatient mortality for comorbidities. Results: There was a total of 7,364,023 patients with a diagnosis of SHF and 10,064,223 patients with a diagnosis of DHF. All-cause inpatient mortality was lowest in overweight patients followed by those with obesity and morbid obesity, whereas mortality was highest in cachexia compared to normal weight for SHF and DHF patients (mortality: overweight 2.56%, obese 3.12%, morbidly obese 3.70%, normal weight 5.60%, and cachexia 15.22%; p&lt;0.001) and DHF patients (mortality: overweight 2.08%, obese 2.43%, morbidly obese 2.93%, normal weight 4.58%, and cachexia 14.25%; p&lt;0.001). This relationship remains similar after multivariate analysis. (SHF patients: overweight OR: 0.49 (0.41-0.58), obesity OR: 0.64 (0.62-0.66), morbid obesity OR: 0.85 (0.83-0.88), and cachexia OR: 2.78 (2.67-2.90); p&lt;0.001; DHF patients: overweight OR: 0.47 (0.40-0.56), obesity OR: 0.61 (0.59-0.63), morbid obesity OR: 0.83 (0.81-0.85), and cachexia OR: 3.09 (2.96-3.23); p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Our data observed that all-cause inpatient mortality in SHF and DHF is lowest in overweight populations followed by obese and morbidly obese populations whereas cachexia has the highest mortality. However, increasing weight above the overweight reduces the obesity paradox benefit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThe effect of high percentage spliced in (hiPSI) TTN truncating variants (TTNtvs) on risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has historically been studied among population subgroups defined by genetic similarity to European reference populations. This has raised questions about the effect of TTNtvs in diverse populations, especially among individuals genetically similar to African reference populations.

ObjectiveTo determine the effect of TTNtvs on risk of DCM in diverse population as measured by genetic distance (GD) in principal component (PC) space.

DesignCohort study

SettingPenn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) is a large, diverse biobank.

ParticipantsParticipants were recruited from across the Penn Medicine healthcare system and volunteered to have their electronic health records linked to biospecimen data including DNA which has undergone whole exome sequencing.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisk of DCM among individuals carrying a hiPSI TTNtv.

ResultsCarrying a hiPSI TTNtv was associated with DCM among PMBB participants across a range of GD deciles from the 1000G European centroid; the effect estimates ranged from odds ratio (OR) = 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 8.56) to OR = 9.39 (95% CI 3.82 to 23.13). When individuals were assigned to population subgroups based on genetic similarity to the 1000G reference populations, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred significant risk of DCM among those genetically similar to the 1000G European reference population (OR = 7.55, 95% CI 4.99 to 11.42, P&lt;0.001) and individuals genetically similar to the 1000G African reference population (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 8.24, P=0.004).

Conclusions and RelevanceTTNtvs are associated with increased risk of DCM among a diverse cohort. There is no significant difference in effect of TTNtvs on DCM risk across deciles of GD from the 1000G European centroid, suggesting genetic background should not be considered when screening individuals for titin-related DCM.

Key Points

QuestionDo high percentage spliced in (hiPSI) titin truncating variants (TTNtvs) confer similar levels of risk for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) across diverse populations?

FindingsIn a cohort study that comprised 43,731 individuals of diverse genetic background with electronic health records linked to whole exome sequencing data, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred increased risk of DCM across all individuals irrespective of genetic background as measured by genetic distance from the 1000 Genomes Project European centroid.

MeaningThe findings of this study suggest that TTNtvs increase risk of DCM among individuals independent of genetic background and that genetic similarity to a reference population should not play a role in screening for genetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundClonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was initially linked to a twofold increase in atherothrombotic events. However, recent investigations have revealed a more nuanced picture, suggesting that CHIP may confer only a modest rise in Myocardial Infarction (MI) risk. This observed lower risk might be influenced by yet unidentified factors that modulate the pathological effects of CHIP. Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY), a common marker of clonal hematopoiesis in men, has emerged as a potential candidate for modulating cardiovascular risk associated with CHIP. In this comprehensive study, we aimed to ascertain the precise risk linked to each somatic mutation or mLOY and explore whether mLOY could exert an influence on the cardiovascular risk associated with CHIP.

MethodsWe conducted a meticulous examination for the presence of CHIP and mLOY using targeted high-throughput sequencing and digital PCR in a cohort of 446 individuals. Among them, 149 patients from the CHAth study had experienced a first myocardial infarction (MI) at the time of inclusion (MI(&#43;) subjects), while 297 individuals from the 3-city cohort had no history of cardiovascular events (CVE) at the time of inclusion (MI(-) subjects). All subjects underwent thorough cardiovascular phenotyping, including a direct assessment of atherosclerotic burden. Our investigation aimed to determine whether mLOY could modulate inflammation, atherosclerosis burden, and atherothrombotic risk associated with CHIP.

ResultsCHIP and mLOY were detected with a substantial prevalence (45.1% and 37.7%, respectively), and their occurrence was similar between MI(&#43;) and MI(-) subjects. Notably, nearly 40% of CHIP(&#43;) male subjects also exhibited mLOY. Interestingly, neither CHIP nor mLOY independently resulted in significant increases in plasma hsCRP levels, atherosclerotic burden, or MI incidence. Moreover, mLOY did not amplify or diminish inflammation, atherosclerosis, or MI incidence among CHIP(&#43;) male subjects. Conversely, inMI(-) male subjects, CHIP heightened the risk of MI over a five-year period, particularly in those lacking mLOY.

ConclusionOur study highlights the high prevalence of CHIP and mLOY in elderly individuals. Importantly, our results demonstrate that neither CHIP nor mLOY in isolation substantially contribute to inflammation, atherosclerosis, or MI incidence. Furthermore, we find that mLOY does not exert a significant influence on the modulation of inflammation, atherosclerosis burden, or atherothrombotic risk associated with CHIP. However, CHIP may accelerate the occurrence of MI, especially when unaccompanied by mLOY. These findings underscore the complexity of the interplay between CHIP, mLOY, and cardiovascular risk, suggesting that large-scale studies with thousands more patients may be necessary to elucidate subtle correlations.</p>
