E.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294249\nBackgroundIn 2021, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) launched the National Hypertension Control Initiative (HTN Initiative) with the goal to enhance HTN control through Bluetooth-enabled self-measured blood pressure (BT SMBP) monitoring and use this data to inform clinical decisions in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with large proportion of their population with uncontrolled BP. We sought to understand the experience of Michigan-based FQHCs in implementing the HTN initiative. MethodsStaff from three Michigan-based FQHCs were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews from September to November 2022. Interviews were conducted in-person and were based on the Tailored Implementation of Chronic Diseases framework. Content analysis was performed by three coders. ResultsTen staff participated in interviews (FQHC 1: n=6, FQHC 2: n=1, FQHC 3: n=3). The FQHCs differed in their stage of implementation and their approach. FQHC 1 created a large-scale, community health worker driven program, FQHC 2 created a small-scale, short term, BP device loan program, and FQHC 3 created a primarily outsourced, large-scale program through a contracted partner. Positive staff attitudes and outcome expectations, previous experience with SMBP grants, and supportive clinic leadership were identified as facilitators to implementation; Patients high social needs, SMBP-related Technology, and insufficient workforce and staff capacity were identified as barriers. ConclusionBT SMBP among FQHC patients is promising but challenges in integrating SMBP data into clinic workflow, workforce capacity to support the high social needs of participants and to assist in reacting to the more frequent BP data remain to be overcome.\nNatural Language Processing for Adjudication of Heart Failure Hospitalizations in a Multi-Center Clinical Trial\nAuthors: Cunningham, J. W.; Singh, P.; Reeder, C.; Claggett, B.; Marti-Castellote, P. M.; Lau, E. S.; Khurshid, S.; Batra, P.; Lubitz, S.; Maddah, M.; Philippakis, A.; Desai, A.; Ellinor, P. T.; Vardeny, O.; Solomon, S. D.; Ho, J. E.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294234\nBackgroundThe gold standard for outcome adjudication in clinical trials is chart review by a physician clinical events committee (CEC), which requires substantial time and expertise. Automated adjudication by natural language processing (NLP) may offer a more resource-efficient alternative. We previously showed that the Community Care Cohort Project (C3PO) NLP model adjudicates heart failure (HF) hospitalizations accurately within one healthcare system. MethodsThis study externally validated the C3PO NLP model against CEC adjudication in the INVESTED trial. INVESTED compared influenza vaccination formulations in 5260 patients with cardiovascular disease at 157 North American sites. A central CEC adjudicated the cause of hospitalizations from medical records. We applied the C3PO NLP model to medical records from 4060 INVESTED hospitalizations and evaluated agreement between the NLP and final consensus CEC HF adjudications. We then fine-tuned the C3PO NLP model (C3PO+INVESTED) and trained a de novo model using half the INVESTED hospitalizations, and evaluated these models in the other half. NLP performance was benchmarked to CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility. Results1074 hospitalizations (26%) were adjudicated as HF by the CEC. There was high agreement between the C3PO NLP and CEC HF adjudications (agreement 87%, kappa statistic 0.69). C3PO NLP model sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 84%. The fine-tuned C3PO and de novo NLP models demonstrated agreement of 93% and kappa of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility was 94% (kappa 0.85). ConclusionOur NLP model developed within a single healthcare system accurately identified HF events relative to the gold-standard CEC in an external multi-center clinical trial. Fine-tuning the model improved agreement and approximated human reproducibility. NLP may improve the efficiency of future multi-center clinical trials by accurately identifying clinical events at scale.\nElectrocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram-based Heart Rate Variability Are Not Equivalent: A Bayesian Simulation Analysis\nAuthors: Dewig, H.; Cohen, J. N.; Renaghan, E. J.; Leary, M. E.; Leary, B. K.; Au, J. S.; Tenan, M. S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294449\nBackgroundHeart rate variability (HRV) is a common measure of autonomic and cardiovascular system function assessed via electrocardiography (ECG). Consumer wearables, commonly employed in epidemiological research, use photoplethysmography (PPG) to report HRV metrics (PRV), although these may not be equivalent. One potential cause of dissociation between HRV and PRV is the variability in pulse transit time (PTT). This study sought to determine if PPG-derived HRV (i.e., PRV) is equivalent to ECG-derived HRV and ascertain if PRV measurement error is sufficient for a biomarker separate from HRV. MethodsThe ECG data from 1,084 subjects were obtained from the PhysioNet Autonomic Aging dataset, and individual PTT variances for both the wrist (n=42) and finger (n=49) were derived from Mol et al. A Bayesian simulation was constructed whereby the individual arrival times of the PPG wave were calculated by placing a Gaussian prior on the individual QRS-wave timings of each ECG series. The standard deviation of the prior corresponds to the PTT variances. This was simulated 10,000 times for each PTT variance. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN) were calculated for both HRV and PRV. The Region of Practical Equivalence bounds (ROPE) were set a priori at {+/-}0.2% of true HRV. The Highest Density Interval (HDI) width, encompassing 95% of the posterior distribution, was calculated for each PTT variance. ResultsThe lowest PTT variance (2.0 SD) corresponded to 88.4% within ROPE for SDNN and 21.4% for RMSSD. As the SD of PTT increases, the equivalence of PRV and HRV decreases for both SDNN and RMSSD. Thus, between PRV and HRV, RMSSD is nearly never equivalent and SDNN is only somewhat equivalent under very strict circumstances. The HDI interval width increases with increasing PTT variance, with the HDI width increasing at a higher rate for RMSSD than SDNN. ConclusionsFor individuals with greater PTT variability, PRV is not a surrogate for HRV. When considering PRV as a unique biometric measure, our findings reveal that SDNN has more favorable measurement properties than RMSSD, though both exhibit a non-uniform measurement error.\nExercise stress in healthy adults: normal ranges for real time cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\nAuthors: Schweitzer, R.; de Marvao, A.; Shah, M.; Inglese, P.; Kellman, P.; Berry, A.; Statton, B.; O'Regan, D. P.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294458\nBackgroundReal-time (RT) exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (exCMR) is an emerging approach for cardiac stress testing as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular imaging assessment. It has advantages over alternative approaches due to its high spatial resolution and use of non-pharmacological stress. As access to exCMR increases, there is a need to establish reference ranges in healthy adults for clinical interpretation. MethodsWe analysed data from 162 healthy adults who had no known cardiovascular disease, did not harbour genetic variants associated with cardiomyopathy, and who completed an exCMR protocol using a pedal ergometer. Participants were imaged at rest and after exercise with left ventricular parameters measured using commercial software by two readers. Prediction intervals were calculated for each parameter. ResultsExercise caused an increase in heart rate (64{+/-}9 bpm vs 133{+/-}19 bpm, P \u003c 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (140{+/-}32 ml vs 148{+/-}36 ml, P \u003c 0.001), stroke volume (82{+/-}18 ml vs 102{+/-}26 ml, P \u003c 0.001), ejection fraction (59{+/-}6% vs 69{+/-}7%, P \u003c 0.001), and cardiac output (5.2{+/-}1.2 l/min vs 10.0{+/-}3.1 l/min, P \u003c 0.001), with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (58{+/-}18 ml vs 46{+/-}16 ml, P \u003c 0.001). There was an effect of gender and age on response to exercise across most parameters. Measurements showed moderate to excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement. ConclusionIn healthy adults, an increase in cardiac output after exercise is driven by a rise in heart rate with both increased ventricular filling and emptying. We establish normal ranges for exercise response, stratified by age and gender, as a reference for the use of exCMR in clinical practice.\nThe impact of Gam-COVID-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26 COVID-19 vaccine, on the biomarkers of endothelial function, coagulation and platelet activation\nAuthors: Turmukhambetova, A.; Yegorov, S.; Korshukov, I.; Barkhanskaya, V.; Kolesnichenko, S.; Klyuyev, D.; Zhumadilova, Z.; Pralieva, A.; Absaghit, L.; Belyayev, R.; Babenko, D.; Hortelano, G. H.; Miller, M. S.; Vazenmiller, D.; Kadyrova, I.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294400\nBackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Although overall considered safe, COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with rare but severe thrombotic events, occurring mainly in the context of adenoviral vectored vaccines. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced hypercoagulability and prothrombotic state is needed to improve vaccine safety profile. MethodsWe assessed changes to the biomarkers of endothelial function (endothelin, ET-1), coagulation (thrombomodulin, THBD and plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI) and platelet activation (platelet activating factor, PAF, and platelet factor 4 IgG antibody, PF4 IgG) within a three-week period after the first (prime) and second (boost) doses of Gam-Covid-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Blood plasma collected from vaccinees (n=58) was assayed using ELISA assays. Participants were stratified by prior COVID-19 exposure based on their baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific serology results. ResultsWe observed a significant post-prime increase in circulating ET-1, with levels sustained after the boost dose compared to baseline. ET-1 elevation following dose 2 was most pronounced in vaccinees without prior COVID-19 exposure. Prior COVID-19 was also associated with a mild increase in post-dose 1 PAI. ConclusionsVaccination was associated with elevated ET-1 up to day 21 after the second vaccine dose, while no marked alterations to other biomarkers, including PF4 IgG, were seen. A role of persistent endothelial activation followingCOVID-19 vaccination warrants further investigation.\nPrevalence of Modifiable Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease among School-going Children and Adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya.\nAuthors: Magutah, K.; Mbuthia, G. W.; Osengo, G.; Odhiambo, D.; Meiring, R.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294556\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in Kenya is rising. Overweight, pre-hypertension and physical inactivity in younger ages is contributory. These risk factors are inadequately documented among Kenyan children and adolescents, hampering CVD prevention. This cross-sectional study randomly sampled 384 school children and adolescents. After obtaining assent and consent, global physical activity (PA) questionnaire was used to assess PA. Body mass index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHtR) were determined. Blood pressure (BP) was also measured. Participants were 14.6{+/-}2.7 years, and 62.6% were female. Overall BMI was 19.8{+/-}3.9 kg/m2 with 8% having [\u0026ge;]25.0 kg/m2, 87% of whom were in secondary schools. Using SBP, 27.9% were at risk of CVD. For age [\u0026ge;]13 years old, males and females proportions were 42.5% and 20% respectively while that for \u003c13 years old, it was 26.5% and 27% respectively. For DBP, 12.8% had elevated- to-hypertensive BP. For ages [\u0026ge;] 13 years old, this was 13.2% and 8.3% for males and females respectively and for the \u003c13 years old, the respective percentages were 11.8 and 25.4. Combining SBP and DBP, 8.1% of participants, mostly males, had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. Thirty-one percent of boys and 15.6% of girls were at CVD risk using respective WHR cutoffs of 0.90 and 0.85 (males, 0.93{+/-}0.02; females, 0.89{+/-}0.03). For WHtR, 39.6% of boys had values \u003e0.463 cut-off (0.493{+/-}0.02), with 52.6% in secondary schools against 32.4% for girls having \u003e0.469 cut-off (0.517{+/-}0.05), 69.7% being in secondary schools. Overall, 45% of participants were sports-inactive and 77.2% did minimal PA. Among school-going children and adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya, prevalence of CVD risk-factors was high especially among boys and in high schools. Large proportions had elevated BP, BMI, WHR and WHtR, and, further, were sedentary, posing high CVD risk. Lifestyle interventions to mitigate this public health concern among children and adolescent are urgently needed.\nComparisons of new-onset peripheral arterial disease in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients exposed to SGLT2I, DPP4I or GLP1a: a population-based cohort study\nAuthors: Chou, O. H. I.; Luo, Z.; Chung, C. T.; Chan, J. S. K.; Li, H.; Lakhani, I.; L, S.; Zhang, Q.; Liu, T.; Wong, W. T.; Cheung, B. M. Y.; Lip, G. Y. H.; Tse, G.; LEUNG, C. F. P.; Zhou, J.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294389\nBackgroundSodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) have been suggested to have beneficial effects against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The comparative risks of new onset peripheral arterial disease (PAD) between SGLT2Is, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1a) remain unknown. ObjectiveThis real-world study aims to compare the risks of PAD upon exposure to SGLT2I and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4I). MethodsThis was a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on either SGLT2I or DPP4I between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2020 using a territory-wide registry in Hong Kong. The primary outcome was new-onset PAD. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching (1:1 ratio) using the nearest neighbour search was performed. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to identify significant associations. A three-arm sensitivity analysis including the GLP1a cohort was conducted. ResultsThis cohort included 75470 T2DM patients (median age: 62.3 years old [SD: 12.8]; 55.79 % males). The SGLT2I and DPP4I groups consisted of 28753 patients and 46717 patients, respectively. After matching, 186 and 256 patients suffered from PAD in the SGLT2I and DPP4I groups respectively, over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. SGLT2I use was associated with lower risks of PAD (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.67-0.98) compared to DPP4I use after adjustments for demographics, comorbidities, medications, renal function, and diabetic laboratory tests. Similar associations were observed in subgroup analyses in male patients above 65 years old, with hypertension, and low HbA1c levels. In the sensitivity analysis, SGLT2I was not associated with lower risks of PAD compared to GLP1a (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.65-1.18). The results remained consistent in the competing risk and the sensitivity analyses. ConclusionsSGLT2I use amongst T2DM patients was associated with lower risks of new-onset PAD and PAD-related outcomes when compared to DPP4I after adjustments.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn 2021, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) launched the National Hypertension Control Initiative (HTN Initiative) with the goal to enhance HTN control through Bluetooth-enabled self-measured blood pressure (BT SMBP) monitoring and use this data to inform clinical decisions in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with large proportion of their population with uncontrolled BP. We sought to understand the experience of Michigan-based FQHCs in implementing the HTN initiative.

MethodsStaff from three Michigan-based FQHCs were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews from September to November 2022. Interviews were conducted in-person and were based on the Tailored Implementation of Chronic Diseases framework. Content analysis was performed by three coders.

ResultsTen staff participated in interviews (FQHC 1: n=6, FQHC 2: n=1, FQHC 3: n=3). The FQHCs differed in their stage of implementation and their approach. FQHC 1 created a large-scale, community health worker driven program, FQHC 2 created a small-scale, short term, BP device loan program, and FQHC 3 created a primarily outsourced, large-scale program through a contracted partner. Positive staff attitudes and outcome expectations, previous experience with SMBP grants, and supportive clinic leadership were identified as facilitators to implementation; Patients high social needs, SMBP-related Technology, and insufficient workforce and staff capacity were identified as barriers.

ConclusionBT SMBP among FQHC patients is promising but challenges in integrating SMBP data into clinic workflow, workforce capacity to support the high social needs of participants and to assist in reacting to the more frequent BP data remain to be overcome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe gold standard for outcome adjudication in clinical trials is chart review by a physician clinical events committee (CEC), which requires substantial time and expertise. Automated adjudication by natural language processing (NLP) may offer a more resource-efficient alternative. We previously showed that the Community Care Cohort Project (C3PO) NLP model adjudicates heart failure (HF) hospitalizations accurately within one healthcare system.

MethodsThis study externally validated the C3PO NLP model against CEC adjudication in the INVESTED trial. INVESTED compared influenza vaccination formulations in 5260 patients with cardiovascular disease at 157 North American sites. A central CEC adjudicated the cause of hospitalizations from medical records. We applied the C3PO NLP model to medical records from 4060 INVESTED hospitalizations and evaluated agreement between the NLP and final consensus CEC HF adjudications. We then fine-tuned the C3PO NLP model (C3PO&#43;INVESTED) and trained a de novo model using half the INVESTED hospitalizations, and evaluated these models in the other half. NLP performance was benchmarked to CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility.

Results1074 hospitalizations (26%) were adjudicated as HF by the CEC. There was high agreement between the C3PO NLP and CEC HF adjudications (agreement 87%, kappa statistic 0.69). C3PO NLP model sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 84%. The fine-tuned C3PO and de novo NLP models demonstrated agreement of 93% and kappa of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. CEC reviewer inter-rater reproducibility was 94% (kappa 0.85).

ConclusionOur NLP model developed within a single healthcare system accurately identified HF events relative to the gold-standard CEC in an external multi-center clinical trial. Fine-tuning the model improved agreement and approximated human reproducibility. NLP may improve the efficiency of future multi-center clinical trials by accurately identifying clinical events at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHeart rate variability (HRV) is a common measure of autonomic and cardiovascular system function assessed via electrocardiography (ECG). Consumer wearables, commonly employed in epidemiological research, use photoplethysmography (PPG) to report HRV metrics (PRV), although these may not be equivalent. One potential cause of dissociation between HRV and PRV is the variability in pulse transit time (PTT). This study sought to determine if PPG-derived HRV (i.e., PRV) is equivalent to ECG-derived HRV and ascertain if PRV measurement error is sufficient for a biomarker separate from HRV.

MethodsThe ECG data from 1,084 subjects were obtained from the PhysioNet Autonomic Aging dataset, and individual PTT variances for both the wrist (n=42) and finger (n=49) were derived from Mol et al. A Bayesian simulation was constructed whereby the individual arrival times of the PPG wave were calculated by placing a Gaussian prior on the individual QRS-wave timings of each ECG series. The standard deviation of the prior corresponds to the PTT variances. This was simulated 10,000 times for each PTT variance. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN) were calculated for both HRV and PRV. The Region of Practical Equivalence bounds (ROPE) were set a priori at {&#43;/-}0.2% of true HRV. The Highest Density Interval (HDI) width, encompassing 95% of the posterior distribution, was calculated for each PTT variance.

ResultsThe lowest PTT variance (2.0 SD) corresponded to 88.4% within ROPE for SDNN and 21.4% for RMSSD. As the SD of PTT increases, the equivalence of PRV and HRV decreases for both SDNN and RMSSD. Thus, between PRV and HRV, RMSSD is nearly never equivalent and SDNN is only somewhat equivalent under very strict circumstances. The HDI interval width increases with increasing PTT variance, with the HDI width increasing at a higher rate for RMSSD than SDNN.

ConclusionsFor individuals with greater PTT variability, PRV is not a surrogate for HRV. When considering PRV as a unique biometric measure, our findings reveal that SDNN has more favorable measurement properties than RMSSD, though both exhibit a non-uniform measurement error.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundReal-time (RT) exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (exCMR) is an emerging approach for cardiac stress testing as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular imaging assessment. It has advantages over alternative approaches due to its high spatial resolution and use of non-pharmacological stress. As access to exCMR increases, there is a need to establish reference ranges in healthy adults for clinical interpretation.

MethodsWe analysed data from 162 healthy adults who had no known cardiovascular disease, did not harbour genetic variants associated with cardiomyopathy, and who completed an exCMR protocol using a pedal ergometer. Participants were imaged at rest and after exercise with left ventricular parameters measured using commercial software by two readers. Prediction intervals were calculated for each parameter.

ResultsExercise caused an increase in heart rate (64{&#43;/-}9 bpm vs 133{&#43;/-}19 bpm, P &lt; 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (140{&#43;/-}32 ml vs 148{&#43;/-}36 ml, P &lt; 0.001), stroke volume (82{&#43;/-}18 ml vs 102{&#43;/-}26 ml, P &lt; 0.001), ejection fraction (59{&#43;/-}6% vs 69{&#43;/-}7%, P &lt; 0.001), and cardiac output (5.2{&#43;/-}1.2 l/min vs 10.0{&#43;/-}3.1 l/min, P &lt; 0.001), with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (58{&#43;/-}18 ml vs 46{&#43;/-}16 ml, P &lt; 0.001). There was an effect of gender and age on response to exercise across most parameters. Measurements showed moderate to excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement.

ConclusionIn healthy adults, an increase in cardiac output after exercise is driven by a rise in heart rate with both increased ventricular filling and emptying. We establish normal ranges for exercise response, stratified by age and gender, as a reference for the use of exCMR in clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Although overall considered safe, COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with rare but severe thrombotic events, occurring mainly in the context of adenoviral vectored vaccines. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced hypercoagulability and prothrombotic state is needed to improve vaccine safety profile.

MethodsWe assessed changes to the biomarkers of endothelial function (endothelin, ET-1), coagulation (thrombomodulin, THBD and plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI) and platelet activation (platelet activating factor, PAF, and platelet factor 4 IgG antibody, PF4 IgG) within a three-week period after the first (prime) and second (boost) doses of Gam-Covid-Vac, an AdV5/AdV26-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. Blood plasma collected from vaccinees (n=58) was assayed using ELISA assays. Participants were stratified by prior COVID-19 exposure based on their baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific serology results.

ResultsWe observed a significant post-prime increase in circulating ET-1, with levels sustained after the boost dose compared to baseline. ET-1 elevation following dose 2 was most pronounced in vaccinees without prior COVID-19 exposure. Prior COVID-19 was also associated with a mild increase in post-dose 1 PAI.

ConclusionsVaccination was associated with elevated ET-1 up to day 21 after the second vaccine dose, while no marked alterations to other biomarkers, including PF4 IgG, were seen. A role of persistent endothelial activation followingCOVID-19 vaccination warrants further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in Kenya is rising. Overweight, pre-hypertension and physical inactivity in younger ages is contributory. These risk factors are inadequately documented among Kenyan children and adolescents, hampering CVD prevention.

This cross-sectional study randomly sampled 384 school children and adolescents. After obtaining assent and consent, global physical activity (PA) questionnaire was used to assess PA. Body mass index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHtR) were determined. Blood pressure (BP) was also measured.

Participants were 14.6{&#43;/-}2.7 years, and 62.6% were female. Overall BMI was 19.8{&#43;/-}3.9 kg/m2 with 8% having [&amp;ge;]25.0 kg/m2, 87% of whom were in secondary schools. Using SBP, 27.9% were at risk of CVD. For age [&amp;ge;]13 years old, males and females proportions were 42.5% and 20% respectively while that for &lt;13 years old, it was 26.5% and 27% respectively. For DBP, 12.8% had elevated- to-hypertensive BP. For ages [&amp;ge;] 13 years old, this was 13.2% and 8.3% for males and females respectively and for the &lt;13 years old, the respective percentages were 11.8 and 25.4. Combining SBP and DBP, 8.1% of participants, mostly males, had elevated-to-hypertensive BP. Thirty-one percent of boys and 15.6% of girls were at CVD risk using respective WHR cutoffs of 0.90 and 0.85 (males, 0.93{&#43;/-}0.02; females, 0.89{&#43;/-}0.03). For WHtR, 39.6% of boys had values &gt;0.463 cut-off (0.493{&#43;/-}0.02), with 52.6% in secondary schools against 32.4% for girls having &gt;0.469 cut-off (0.517{&#43;/-}0.05), 69.7% being in secondary schools. Overall, 45% of participants were sports-inactive and 77.2% did minimal PA.

Among school-going children and adolescents in Eldoret, Kenya, prevalence of CVD risk-factors was high especially among boys and in high schools. Large proportions had elevated BP, BMI, WHR and WHtR, and, further, were sedentary, posing high CVD risk. Lifestyle interventions to mitigate this public health concern among children and adolescent are urgently needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) have been suggested to have beneficial effects against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The comparative risks of new onset peripheral arterial disease (PAD) between SGLT2Is, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1a) remain unknown.

ObjectiveThis real-world study aims to compare the risks of PAD upon exposure to SGLT2I and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4I).

MethodsThis was a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on either SGLT2I or DPP4I between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2020 using a territory-wide registry in Hong Kong. The primary outcome was new-onset PAD. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching (1:1 ratio) using the nearest neighbour search was performed. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to identify significant associations. A three-arm sensitivity analysis including the GLP1a cohort was conducted.

ResultsThis cohort included 75470 T2DM patients (median age: 62.3 years old [SD: 12.8]; 55.79 % males). The SGLT2I and DPP4I groups consisted of 28753 patients and 46717 patients, respectively. After matching, 186 and 256 patients suffered from PAD in the SGLT2I and DPP4I groups respectively, over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. SGLT2I use was associated with lower risks of PAD (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.67-0.98) compared to DPP4I use after adjustments for demographics, comorbidities, medications, renal function, and diabetic laboratory tests. Similar associations were observed in subgroup analyses in male patients above 65 years old, with hypertension, and low HbA1c levels. In the sensitivity analysis, SGLT2I was not associated with lower risks of PAD compared to GLP1a (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.65-1.18). The results remained consistent in the competing risk and the sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsSGLT2I use amongst T2DM patients was associated with lower risks of new-onset PAD and PAD-related outcomes when compared to DPP4I after adjustments.
