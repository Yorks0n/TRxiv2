M.; Rätsch, G.; Borgwardt, K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24302063\nMotivationAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome that affects a large fraction of all critically ill patients, and early diagnosis to receive adequate treatment is as imperative as it is challenging to make early. Consequently, machine learning approaches have been developed to predict AKI ahead of time. However, the prevalence of AKI is often underestimated in state-of-the-art approaches, as they rely on an AKI event annotation solely based on creatinine, ignoring urine output. MethodsWe construct and evaluate early warning systems for AKI in a multi-disciplinary ICU setting, using the complete KDIGO definition of AKI. We propose several variants of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT)-based models, including a novel time-stacking based approach. A state-of-the-art LSTM-based model previously proposed for AKI prediction is used as a comparison, which was not specifically evaluated in ICU settings yet. ResultsWe find that optimal performance is achieved by using GBDT with the time-based stacking technique (AUPRC=65.7%, compared with the LSTM-based models AUPRC=62.6%), which is motivated by the high relevance of time since ICU admission for this task. Both models show mildly reduced performance in the limited training data setting, perform fairly across different subco-horts, and exhibit no issues in gender transfer. ConclusionFollowing the official KDIGO definition substantially increases the number of annotated AKI events. In our study GBDTs outperform LSTM models for AKI prediction. Generally, we find that both model types are robust in a variety of challenging settings arising for ICU data.\nCan unguided machine learning re-discover physiologic signatures of neonatal sepsis?\nAuthors: Sullivan, B. A.; Mesner, I. G.; Fairchild, K. D.; Lake, D. E.; Moorman, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302230\nBackgroundCardiorespiratory deterioration due to sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for extremely premature infants with very low birth weight (VLBW, birthweight \u003c1500g). Abnormal heart rate (HR) patterns precede the clinical diagnosis of late-onset sepsis in this population. Decades ago, clinicians recognized a pattern of reduced HR variability and increased HR decelerations in electrocardiogram tracings of septic preterm infants. A predictive logistic regression model was developed from this finding using mathematical algorithms that detect this signature of illness. Display of this model as the fold increase in risk of imminent sepsis reduced mortality in a large randomized trial. Here, we sought to determine if machine learning or deep learning approaches would identify this uncommon but distinctive signature of sepsis in VLBW infants. MethodsWe studied VLBW infants admitted from 2012 to 2021 to a regional Level IV NICU. We collected one-hour HR time series data from bedside monitoring sampled at 0.5 Hz (n=300 HR values per series) throughout the NICU admission. First, we applied the principles of highly comparative time series analysis (HCTSA) to generate many mathematical time series features and combined them in a machine learning model. Next, we used deep learning in the form of a convolutional neural network on the raw data to learn the HR features. The output was a set of HR records determined by HCTSA or deep learning to be at high risk for imminent sepsis. ResultsWe analyzed data from 566 infants with 61 episodes of sepsis. HCTSA and deep learning models predicted sepsis with high out-of-sample validation metrics. The riskiest records determined by both approaches demonstrated the previously identified HR signatures-reduced variability and increased decelerations. ConclusionsWe tested the ability of unguided machine learning approaches to detect the novel HR signature of sepsis in VLBW infants previously identified by human experts. Our main finding is that the computerized approach returned the same result - it identified heart rate characteristics of reduced variability and transient decelerations. We conclude that unguided machine learning can be as effective as human experts in identifying even a very rare phenotype in clinical data.\n",
