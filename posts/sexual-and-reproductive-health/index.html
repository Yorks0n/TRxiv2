M.; Benny, P.; Garmire, L.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294898\nEpigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis (EWAS) is an important approach to identify biomarkers for early disease detection and prognosis prediction, yet its results could be confounded by other factors such as cell-type heterogeneity and patient characteristics. In this study, we address the importance of confounding adjustment by examining DNA methylation patterns in cord blood exposed to severe preeclampsia (PE), a prevalent and potentially fatal pregnancy complication. Without such adjustment, a misleading global hypomethylation pattern is obtained. However, after adjusting cell type proportions and patient clinical characteristics, most of the so-called significant CpG methylation changes associated with severe PE disappear. Rather, the major effect of PE on cord blood is through the proportion changes in different cell types. These results are validated using a previously published cord blood DNA methylation dataset, where global hypomethylation pattern was also wrongfully obtained without confounding adjustment. Additionally, several cell types significantly change as gestation progress (eg. granulocyte, nRBC, CD4T, and B cells), further confirming the importance of cell type adjustment in EWAS study of cord blood tissues. Our study urges the community to perform confounding adjustments in EWAS studies, based on cell type heterogeneity and other patient characteristics.\nProtocol for a scoping review of literature on digital sexual, reproductive, and gender health care for LGBTQI+ youth\nAuthors: McLeod, J.; Flowers, P.; Gibbs, J.; Estcourt, C.

In high-income, developed countries, barriers include confidentiality concerns; stigma and discrimination; and health care providers lack of specific training. Digital SRHC and GHC have the potential to overcome key barriers for LGBTQI+ youth by offering anonymous and independent access to care. However, the literature on digital SRHC and GHC for LGBTQI+ youth is fragmented, often focussing on one sub-population at a time, despite shared barriers. The extent and nature of recent literature regarding digital SRHC and GHC for LGBTQI+ youth is unclear, as is acceptability of, and barriers/facilitators to, LGBTQI+ youth engaging with digital SRHC and GHC. ObjectiveTo identify, describe, and evaluate the methodological quality of, the existing literature on digital SRHC and GHC for LGBTQI+ youth in high-income, developed countries, synthesise study findings, and make recommendations for future research. Inclusion criteriaResearch studies from 2018 onward in published and grey literature on any aspect of digital (e.g., websites, mobile applications) SRHC and GHC (e.g., online information, support and advice, and clinical care for STIs and HIV, fertility, sexual violence, sexual wellbeing, and gender expression and transition) for LGBTQI+ youth (aged 10-35 years) in high-income, developed countries.
