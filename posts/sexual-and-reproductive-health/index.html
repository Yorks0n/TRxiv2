L.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296341\nIntroductionMultiplathogen home-based self-sampling offers an opportunity to increase access to screening and treatment. Infections include sexually transmitted (HIV, Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv), human papillomavirus [HPV] for cervical precancer detection) and non-sexually transmitted pathogens (Schistosoma haematobium (Sh)) pathogens, in endemic settings with high co-infection prevalence. Chronic infection may lead to disability (female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) and death (cervical cancer). The Zipime-Weka-Schista (Do self-testing sister!) aims to evaluate the validity, acceptability, uptake, impact and cost-effectiveness of multi-pathogen self-sampling for genital infections among women in Zambia. Methods and AnalysisThis is a longitudinal cohort study aiming to enrol 2,500 non-pregnant, sexually active and non-menstruating women aged 15-50 years from two districts in Zambia with two year follow up. During home visits, community health workers offer HIV and Tv self-testing and cervicovaginal self-swabs for (i) HPV by GeneXpert and, (ii) Sh DNA detection by conventional (PCR) and isothermal (RPA) molecular methods. Schistosoma ova and circulating anodic antigen are detected in urine. At a clinic follow-up midwifes perform same procedures and obtain hand-held colposcopic images. High-risk -HPV positive women are referred for a two-quadrant cervical biopsy according to age and HIV status. A cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted in parallel. Ethics and disseminationThe University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (UNZABREC) approved the study in September 2021 (reference: 1858-2021), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine(LSHTM) (reference: 25258) and Ministry of Health and local superintendents. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrolment. Data will be available upon request on LSHTM Data Compass.

Racial disparities specific to endometriosis treatments are unknown. ObjectiveWe aim to investigate differences in patterns of drug prescriptions specific to endometriosis management in Black and White patients prior to diagnosis and after diagnosis of endometriosis and compare these differences to racial disparities established in the general population. Study DesignWe conduct a retrospective cohort study using observational health data from the IBM MarketScan(R) Multi-state Medicaid dataset. We identify a cohort of endometriosis patients consisting of women between the ages of 15 and 49 with an endometriosis-related surgical procedure and a diagnosis code for endometriosis within 30 days of this procedure. Cohort is further restricted to patients with at least 3 years of continuous observation prior to diagnosis. We identify a non-endometriosis cohort of women between the ages of 15 and 49 with no endometriosis diagnosis and at least 1 year of continuous observation. We compare prevalence of prescriptions across selected drug classes for Black vs. White endometriosis patients. We further examine prevalence differences in the non-endometriosis cohort and prevalence differences pre- and post-diagnosis in the endometriosis cohort. ResultsThe endometriosis cohort comprised 16,372 endometriosis patients (23.3% Black, 66.0% White). Of the 28 drug classes examined, 17 were prescribed significantly less in Black patients compared to 21 in non-endometriosis cohort (n=3,663,904), and 4 were prescribed significantly more in Black patients compared to 6 in the non-endometriosis cohort. Of the 17 drugs prescribed more often in White patients, 16 have larger disparities pre-diagnosis than post-diagnosis. ConclusionsOur analysis identified significant differences in medication prescriptions between White and Black patients with endometriosis, notably in hormonal treatments, pain management, and treatments for common endometriosis co-morbidities. Racial disparities in drug prescriptions are well established in healthcare, and better understanding these disparities in the specific context of chronic reproductive conditions and chronic pain is important for increasing equity in drug prescription practices.\n",
