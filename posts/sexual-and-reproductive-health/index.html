M.; Benny, P.; Garmire, L.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294898\nEpigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis (EWAS) is an important approach to identify biomarkers for early disease detection and prognosis prediction, yet its results could be confounded by other factors such as cell-type heterogeneity and patient characteristics. In this study, we address the importance of confounding adjustment by examining DNA methylation patterns in cord blood exposed to severe preeclampsia (PE), a prevalent and potentially fatal pregnancy complication. Without such adjustment, a misleading global hypomethylation pattern is obtained. However, after adjusting cell type proportions and patient clinical characteristics, most of the so-called significant CpG methylation changes associated with severe PE disappear. Rather, the major effect of PE on cord blood is through the proportion changes in different cell types. These results are validated using a previously published cord blood DNA methylation dataset, where global hypomethylation pattern was also wrongfully obtained without confounding adjustment. Additionally, several cell types significantly change as gestation progress (eg. granulocyte, nRBC, CD4T, and B cells), further confirming the importance of cell type adjustment in EWAS study of cord blood tissues. Our study urges the community to perform confounding adjustments in EWAS studies, based on cell type heterogeneity and other patient characteristics.\nDoes screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis affect the incidence of these infections in men who have sex with men taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) ? Results from a randomized, multicentre controlled trial (the Gonoscreen study)\nAuthors: Vanbaelen, T.; Tsoumanis, A.; Florence, E.; Van Dijck, C.; Huis in 't Veld, D.; Sauvage, A.

We present the first randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of screening versus non-screening for NG/CT on the incidence of these infections in MSM taking PrEP. MethodsA multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 3X3 screening for NG/CT versus non-screening was conducted among MSM taking PrEP in five HIV reference centers in Belgium. Participants attended the PrEP clinics quarterly for 12 months. NG/CT was tested at each visit in both arms, but results were not provided to the non-screening arm. The primary outcome was the incidence rate (IR) of NG/CT infections in each arm, assessed in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of the non-screening arm was proven if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the IR ratio (IRR) was lower than 1.25. The trial protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04269434). FindingsBetween September 2020 and June 2021, 508 subjects were randomized to the 3X3 screening arm and 506 to the non-screening arm. The overall IR of NG/CT was 0.155 cases/100 person-days (95%CI 0.128-0.186) in the 3x3 screening arm and 0.205 (95%CI 0.171-0.246) in the non-screening arm. The IR was significantly higher in the non-screening arm (IRR 1.318, 95%CI 1.068-1.627). Participants in the non-screening arm had a higher incidence of CT infections and symptomatic CT infections. There were no significant differences in NG infections. Participants in the non-screening arm consumed significantly less antimicrobials. No serious adverse events were reported. InterpretationWe failed to show that non-screening for NG/CT is non-inferior to 3-site 3-monthly screening in MSM taking PrEP in Belgium. However, screening was associated with higher antibiotic consumption and had no effect on the incidence of NG. Therefore, our findings do not provide strong support for screening for NG/CT in this population. FundingBelgian Healthcare Knowledge Center (KCE - INV18-1133)\n",
