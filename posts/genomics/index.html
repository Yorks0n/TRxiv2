Q.\nScore: 261.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572975\nGenomic analyses of bacterial isolates are necessary to monitor the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence determinants. Herein, we provide a comprehensive genomic description of a collection of 339 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with bacteremia between 2014 and 2022. Nosocomial acquisition accounted for 56.6% of episodes, with vascular catheters being the predominant source of infection (31.8%). Cases of fatality (27.4%), persistent bacteremia (19.5%) and diagnosis of septic emboli (24.2%) were documented. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a 140% increase of the episodes of S. aureus bacteremia per year, with a concomitant increase of the cases from nosocomial origin. This prompted us to investigate the existence of genetic features associated with S. aureus isolates from the COVID-19 pandemic. While genes conferring resistance to {beta}-lactams (blaI-blaR-blaZ), macrolides (ermA, ermC, ermT, mphC, msrA) and aminoglycosides (ant(4)-Ia, ant(9)-Ia, aph(3)-IIIa, aph(2)-Ih) were prevalent in our collection, detection of the msrA and mphC genes increased significantly in pandemic S. aureus isolates. Similarly, we observed a higher prevalence of isolates carrying the genes encoding the Clumping Factors A and B, involved in fibrinogen binding. Of note, macrolides were extensively used as accessory therapy for COVID-19 and fibrinogen levels were usually elevated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, our results reveal a remarkable adaptation of the S. aureus isolates to the COVID-19 pandemic context and demonstrates the potential of whole-genome sequencing to conduct molecular epidemiology studies.\nCRISPRmap: Sequencing-free optical pooled screens mapping multi-omic phenotypes in cells and tissue\nAuthors: Gu, J.; Iyer, A.; Wesley, B.; Taglialatela, A.; Leuzzi, G.; Hangai, S.; Decker, A.; Gu, R.; Klickstein, N.; Shuai, Y.; Jankovic, K.; Parker-Burns, L.; Jin, Y.; Zhang, J. Y.; Hong, J.; Niu, X.; Chou, J.; Landau, D. A.; Azizi, E.; Chan, E. M.; Ciccia, A.; Gaublomme, J. T.\nScore: 48.3, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.572587\nPooled genetic screens are powerful tools to study gene function in a high-throughput manner. Typically, sequencing-based screens require cell lysis, which limits the examination of critical phenotypes such as cell morphology, protein subcellular localization, and cell-cell/tissue interactions. In contrast, emerging optical pooled screening methods enable the investigation of these spatial phenotypes in response to targeted CRISPR perturbations. In this study, we report a multi-omic optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we have named CRISPRmap. Our method combines a novel in situ CRISPR guide identifying barcode readout approach with concurrent multiplexed immunofluorescence and in situ RNA detection. CRISPRmap barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency, while reducing both dependency on third party proprietary sequencing reagents and assay cost. Notably, we conducted a multi-omic base-editing screen in a breast cancer cell line on core DNA damage repair genes involved in the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways investigating how nucleotide variants in those genes influence DNA damage signaling and cell cycle regulation following treatment with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents commonly used for cancer therapy. Approximately a million cells were profiled with our multi-omic approach, providing a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of the functional consequences of the studied variants. CRISPRmap enabled us to pinpoint likely-pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our approach effectively distinguished barcodes of a pooled library in tumor tissue, and we coupled it with cell-type and molecular phenotyping by cyclic immunofluorescence. Multi-omic spatial analysis of how CRISPR-perturbed cells respond to various environmental cues in the tissue context offers the potential to significantly expand our understanding of tissue biology in both health and disease.\nScalable ultra-high-throughput single-cell chromatin and RNA sequencing reveals gene regulatory dynamics linking macrophage polarization to autoimmune disease\nAuthors: Lobato-Moreno, S.; Yildiz, U.; Claringbould, A.; Servaas, N. H.; Vlachou, E. P.; Arnold, C.; Bauersachs, H. G.; Campos-Fornes, V.; Prummel, K. D.; Noh, K. M.; Marttinen, M.; Zaugg, J. B.\nScore: 40.7, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573253\nEnhancers and transcription factors (TFs) are crucial in regulating cellular processes, including disease-associated cell states. Current multiomic technologies to study these elements in gene regulatory mechanisms lack multiplexing capability and scalability. Here, we present SUM-seq, a cost-effective, scalable Single-cell Ultra-high-throughput Multiomic sequencing method for co-assaying chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single nuclei. SUM-seq enables profiling hundreds of samples at the million cell scale and outperforms current high-throughput single-cell methods. We applied SUM-seq to dissect the gene regulatory mechanisms governing macrophage polarization and explored their link to traits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our analyses confirmed known TFs orchestrating M1 and M2 macrophage programs, unveiled key regulators, and demonstrated extensive enhancer rewiring. Integration with GWAS data further pinpointed the impact of specific TFs on a set of immune traits. Notably, inferred enhancers regulated by the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (ISGF3) complex were enriched for rheumatoid arthritis-associated genetic variants, and their target genes included known drug targets. This highlights the potential of SUM-seq for dissecting molecular disease mechanisms. SUM-seq offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for ultra-high-throughput single-cell multiomic sequencing, excelling in unraveling complex gene regulatory networks in cell differentiation, responses to perturbations, and disease studies.\nA comparative analysis of planarian genomes reveals regulatory conservation in the face of rapid structural divergence\nAuthors: Ivankovic, M.; Brand, J. N.; Pandolfini, L.; Brown, T.; Pippel, M.; Rozanski, A.; Schubert, T.; Grohme, M. A.; Winkler, S.; Robledillo, L.; Zhang, M.; Codino, A.; Gustincich, S.; Vila-Farre, M.; Zhang, S.; Papantonis, A.; Marques, A.; Rink, J. C.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572568\nThe planarian Schmidtea mediterranea can regenerate its entire body from small tissue fragments and is studied as regeneration model species. The assembly and functional analysis of planarian genomes has proven challenging due its high A/T content (70% A/T), repetitive nature, and limited transferability of routine laboratory protocols due to their divergent biochemistry. Only few and often fragmented genome assemblies are currently available, and open challenges include the provision of well-annotated chromosome-scale reference assemblies of the model species and other planarians for a comparative genome evolution perspective. Here we report a haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly and high-quality gene annotations of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and provide putative regulatory region annotations via optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols. To additionally leverage sequence conservation for regulatory element annotations, we generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies and chromatin accessibility data for the three closest relatives of S. mediterranea: S. polychroa, S. nova, and S. lugubris. We find substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions, yet reveal remarkable conservation in ChIP-mark bearing open chromatin regions identified as promoters and enhancers in S. mediterranea. The resulting high-confidence set of evolutionary conserved enhancers and promoters provides a valuable resource for the analysis of gene regulatory circuits and their evolution within the taxon. In addition, our four chromosome-scale genome assemblies provide a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to a degradation of synteny across the genus. Interestingly, we further find independent and near-complete losses of the ancestral metazoan synteny across Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups, indicating that platyhelminth genomes largely evolve without syntenic constraints. Our work provides valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and sets a foundation for the comparative genomics of planarians. We reveal a contrast between the fast structural evolution of planarian genomes and the conservation of their regulatory elements, suggesting a unique genome evolution in flatworms where gene positioning may not be essential.\nA single-cell transposable element atlas of human cell identity\nAuthors: Reyes-Gopar, H.; Marston, J. L.; Singh, B.; Greenig, M.; Lin, J.; Ostrowski, M. A.; Randall, K. N.; Sandoval-Motta, S.; Dopkins, N.; Lawrence, E.; O'Mara, M. M.; Fei, T.; Duarte, R. R. R.; Powell, T. R.; Hernandez-Lemus, E.; Iniguez, L. P.; Nixon, D. F.; Bendall, M. L.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573568\nSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex biological systems. However, most sequencing studies overlook the contribution of transposable element (TE) expression to the transcriptome. In both scRNA-seq and bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantification of TE expression is challenging due to repetitive sequence content and poorly characterized TE gene models. Here, we developed a tool and analysis pipeline for Single cell Transposable Element Locus Level Analysis of scRNA Sequencing (Stellarscope) that reassigns multi-mapped reads to specific genomic loci using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Using Stellarscope, we built an atlas of TE expression in human PBMCs. We found that locus-specific TEs delineate cell types and define new cell subsets not identified by standard mRNA expression profiles. Altogether, this study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of transposable elements in human biology.\nAnnelid methylomes reveal ancestral developmental and ageing-associated epigenetic erosion across Bilateria\nAuthors: Guynes, K.; Sarre, L. A.; Carrillo-Baltodano, A. M.; Davies, B. E.; Xu, L.; Liang, Y.; Martin-Zamora, F. M.; Hurd, P. J.; de Mendoza, A.; Martin-Duran, J. M.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572802\nBackgroundDNA methylation in the form of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most abundant base modification in animals. However, 5mC levels vary widely across taxa. While vertebrate genomes are hypermethylated, in most invertebrates, 5mC concentrates on constantly and highly transcribed genes (gene body methylation; GbM) and, in some species, on transposable elements (TEs), a pattern known as mosaic. Yet, the role and developmental dynamics of 5mC and how these explain interspecific differences in DNA methylation patterns remain poorly understood, especially in Spiralia, a large clade of invertebrates comprising nearly half of the animal phyla. ResultsHere, we generate base-resolution methylomes for three species with distinct genomic features and phylogenetic positions in Annelida, a major spiralian phylum. All possible 5mC patterns occur in annelids, from typical invertebrate intermediate levels in a mosaic distribution to hypermethylation and methylation loss. GbM is common to annelids with 5mC, and methylation differences across species are explained by taxon-specific transcriptional dynamics or the presence of intronic TEs. Notably, the link between GbM and transcription decays during development, and there is a gradual and global, age-dependent demethylation in adult stages. Moreover, reducing 5mC levels with cytidine analogues during early development impairs normal embryogenesis and reactivates TEs in the annelid Owenia fusiformis. ConclusionsOur study indicates that global epigenetic erosion during development and ageing is an ancestral feature of bilateral animals. However, the tight link between transcription and gene body methylation is likely important in early embryonic stages, and 5mC-mediated TE silencing probably emerged convergently across animal lineages.\nComparative genomics of Cryptococcus and Kwoniella reveals pathogenesis evolution and contrasting modes of karyotype evolution via chromosome fusion or intercentromeric recombination\nAuthors: Coelho, M. A.; David-Palma, M.; Shea, T.; Bowers, K.; McGinley-Smith, S.; Mohammad, A. W.; Gnirke, A.; Yurkov, A. M.; Nowrousian, M.; Sun, S.; Cuomo, C. A.; Heitman, J.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573464\nA large-scale comparative genomic analysis was conducted for the global human fungal pathogens within the Cryptococcus genus, compared to non-pathogenic Cryptococcus species, and related species from the sister genus Kwoniella. Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for multiple species of both genera, resulting in a dataset encompassing virtually all of their known diversity. Although Cryptococcus and Kwoniella have comparable genome sizes (about 19.2 and 22.9 Mb) and similar gene content, hinting at pre-adaptive pathogenic potential, our analysis found evidence in pathogenic Cryptococcus species of specific examples of gene gain (via horizontal gene transfer) and gene loss, which might represent evolutionary signatures of pathogenic development. Genome analysis also revealed a significant variation in chromosome number and structure between the two genera. By combining synteny analysis and experimental centromere validation, we found that most Cryptococcus species have 14 chromosomes, whereas most Kwoniella species have fewer (11, 8, 5 or even as few as 3). Reduced chromosome number in Kwoniella is associated with formation of giant chromosomes (up to 18 Mb) through repeated chromosome fusion events, each marked by a pericentric inversion and centromere loss. While similar chromosome inversion-fusion patterns were observed in all Kwoniella species with fewer than 14 chromosomes, no such pattern was detected in Cryptococcus. Instead, Cryptococcus species with less than 14 chromosomes, underwent chromosome reductions primarily through rearrangements associated with the loss of repeat-rich centromeres. Additionally, Cryptococcus genomes exhibited frequent interchromosomal translocations, including intercentromeric recombination facilitated by transposons shared between centromeres. Taken together, our findings advance our understanding of genomic changes possibly associated with pathogenicity in Cryptococcus and provide a foundation to elucidate mechanisms of centromere loss and chromosome fusion driving distinct karyotypes in closely related fungal species, including prominent global human pathogens.\nCharacterizing uncertainty in predictions of genomic sequence-to-activity models\nAuthors: Bajwa, A.; Rastogi, R.; Kathail, P.; Shuai, R. W.; Ioannidis, N. M.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572730\nGenomic sequence-to-activity models are increasingly utilized to understand gene regulatory syntax and probe the functional consequences of regulatory variation. Current models make accurate predictions of relative activity levels across the human reference genome, but their performance is more limited for predicting the effects of genetic variants, such as explaining gene expression variation across individuals. To better understand the causes of these shortcomings, we examine the uncertainty in predictions of genomic sequence-to-activity models using an ensemble of Basenji2 model replicates. We characterize prediction consistency on four types of sequences: reference genome sequences, reference genome sequences perturbed with TF motifs, eQTLs, and personal genome sequences. We observe that models tend to make high-confidence predictions on reference sequences, even when incorrect, and low-confidence predictions on sequences with variants. For eQTLs and personal genome sequences, we find that model replicates make inconsistent predictions in \u003e50% of cases. Our findings suggest strategies to improve performance of these models.\nMnM: a machine learning approach to detect replication states and genomic subpopulations for single-cell DNA replication timing disentanglement\nAuthors: Josephides, J. M.; Chen, C.-L.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573369\nWe introduce MnM, an efficient tool for characterising single-cell DNA replication states and revealing genomic subpopulations in heterogeneous samples, notably cancers. MnM uses sin-gle-cell copy-number data to accurately perform missing-value imputation, classify cell repli-cation states and detect genomic heterogeneity, which allows to separate somatic copy-num-ber alterations from copy-number variations due to DNA replication. By applying our machine learning methods, our research unveils critical insights into chromosomal aberrations and showcases ubiquitous aneuploidy in tumorigenesis. MnM democratises single-cell subpopu-lation detection which, in hand, enables the extraction of single-cell DNA replication timing (scRT) profiles from genomically-heterogenous subpopulations detected by DNA content and issued from single samples. By analysing over 119,000 human single cells from cultured cell lines, patient tumours as well as patient-derived xenograft samples, the copy-number and rep-lication timing profiles issued in this study lead to the first multi-sample subpopulation-disen-tangled scRT atlas and act as data contribution for further cancer research. Our results high-light the necessity of studying in vivo samples to comprehensively grasp the complexities of DNA replication, given that cell lines, while convenient, lack dynamic environmental factors. This tool offers to advance our understanding of cancer initiation and progression, facilitating further research in the interface of genomic instability and replication stress.

A.; Goronzy, I. N.; Blanco, M. R.; Guo, J. K.; Guttman, M.\nScore: 146.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571730\nGene expression is controlled by the dynamic localization of thousands of distinct regulatory proteins to precise regions of DNA. Understanding this cell-type specific process has been a goal of molecular biology for decades yet remains challenging because most current DNA-protein mapping methods study one protein at a time. To overcome this, we developed ChIP-DIP (ChIP Done In Parallel), a split-pool based method that enables simultaneous, genome-wide mapping of hundreds of diverse regulatory proteins in a single experiment. We demonstrate that ChIP-DIP generates highly accurate maps for all classes of DNA-associated proteins, including histone modifications, chromatin regulators, transcription factors, and RNA Polymerases. Using these data, we explore quantitative combinations of protein localization on genomic DNA to define distinct classes of regulatory elements and their functional activity. Our data demonstrate that ChIP-DIP enables the generation of consortium level, context-specific protein localization maps within any molecular biology lab.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Genomic analyses of bacterial isolates are necessary to monitor the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence determinants. Herein, we provide a comprehensive genomic description of a collection of 339 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with bacteremia between 2014 and 2022. Nosocomial acquisition accounted for 56.6% of episodes, with vascular catheters being the predominant source of infection (31.8%). Cases of fatality (27.4%), persistent bacteremia (19.5%) and diagnosis of septic emboli (24.2%) were documented. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a 140% increase of the episodes of S. aureus bacteremia per year, with a concomitant increase of the cases from nosocomial origin. This prompted us to investigate the existence of genetic features associated with S. aureus isolates from the COVID-19 pandemic. While genes conferring resistance to {beta}-lactams (blaI-blaR-blaZ), macrolides (ermA, ermC, ermT, mphC, msrA) and aminoglycosides (ant(4)-Ia, ant(9)-Ia, aph(3)-IIIa, aph(2)-Ih) were prevalent in our collection, detection of the msrA and mphC genes increased significantly in pandemic S. aureus isolates. Similarly, we observed a higher prevalence of isolates carrying the genes encoding the Clumping Factors A and B, involved in fibrinogen binding. Of note, macrolides were extensively used as accessory therapy for COVID-19 and fibrinogen levels were usually elevated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, our results reveal a remarkable adaptation of the S. aureus isolates to the COVID-19 pandemic context and demonstrates the potential of whole-genome sequencing to conduct molecular epidemiology studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pooled genetic screens are powerful tools to study gene function in a high-throughput manner. Typically, sequencing-based screens require cell lysis, which limits the examination of critical phenotypes such as cell morphology, protein subcellular localization, and cell-cell/tissue interactions. In contrast, emerging optical pooled screening methods enable the investigation of these spatial phenotypes in response to targeted CRISPR perturbations. In this study, we report a multi-omic optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we have named CRISPRmap. Our method combines a novel in situ CRISPR guide identifying barcode readout approach with concurrent multiplexed immunofluorescence and in situ RNA detection. CRISPRmap barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency, while reducing both dependency on third party proprietary sequencing reagents and assay cost. Notably, we conducted a multi-omic base-editing screen in a breast cancer cell line on core DNA damage repair genes involved in the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways investigating how nucleotide variants in those genes influence DNA damage signaling and cell cycle regulation following treatment with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents commonly used for cancer therapy. Approximately a million cells were profiled with our multi-omic approach, providing a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of the functional consequences of the studied variants. CRISPRmap enabled us to pinpoint likely-pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our approach effectively distinguished barcodes of a pooled library in tumor tissue, and we coupled it with cell-type and molecular phenotyping by cyclic immunofluorescence. Multi-omic spatial analysis of how CRISPR-perturbed cells respond to various environmental cues in the tissue context offers the potential to significantly expand our understanding of tissue biology in both health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enhancers and transcription factors (TFs) are crucial in regulating cellular processes, including disease-associated cell states. Current multiomic technologies to study these elements in gene regulatory mechanisms lack multiplexing capability and scalability. Here, we present SUM-seq, a cost-effective, scalable Single-cell Ultra-high-throughput Multiomic sequencing method for co-assaying chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single nuclei. SUM-seq enables profiling hundreds of samples at the million cell scale and outperforms current high-throughput single-cell methods. We applied SUM-seq to dissect the gene regulatory mechanisms governing macrophage polarization and explored their link to traits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our analyses confirmed known TFs orchestrating M1 and M2 macrophage programs, unveiled key regulators, and demonstrated extensive enhancer rewiring. Integration with GWAS data further pinpointed the impact of specific TFs on a set of immune traits. Notably, inferred enhancers regulated by the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (ISGF3) complex were enriched for rheumatoid arthritis-associated genetic variants, and their target genes included known drug targets. This highlights the potential of SUM-seq for dissecting molecular disease mechanisms. SUM-seq offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for ultra-high-throughput single-cell multiomic sequencing, excelling in unraveling complex gene regulatory networks in cell differentiation, responses to perturbations, and disease studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea can regenerate its entire body from small tissue fragments and is studied as regeneration model species. The assembly and functional analysis of planarian genomes has proven challenging due its high A/T content (70% A/T), repetitive nature, and limited transferability of routine laboratory protocols due to their divergent biochemistry. Only few and often fragmented genome assemblies are currently available, and open challenges include the provision of well-annotated chromosome-scale reference assemblies of the model species and other planarians for a comparative genome evolution perspective. Here we report a haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly and high-quality gene annotations of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and provide putative regulatory region annotations via optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols. To additionally leverage sequence conservation for regulatory element annotations, we generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies and chromatin accessibility data for the three closest relatives of S. mediterranea: S. polychroa, S. nova, and S. lugubris. We find substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions, yet reveal remarkable conservation in ChIP-mark bearing open chromatin regions identified as promoters and enhancers in S. mediterranea. The resulting high-confidence set of evolutionary conserved enhancers and promoters provides a valuable resource for the analysis of gene regulatory circuits and their evolution within the taxon. In addition, our four chromosome-scale genome assemblies provide a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to a degradation of synteny across the genus. Interestingly, we further find independent and near-complete losses of the ancestral metazoan synteny across Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups, indicating that platyhelminth genomes largely evolve without syntenic constraints. Our work provides valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and sets a foundation for the comparative genomics of planarians. We reveal a contrast between the fast structural evolution of planarian genomes and the conservation of their regulatory elements, suggesting a unique genome evolution in flatworms where gene positioning may not be essential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex biological systems. However, most sequencing studies overlook the contribution of transposable element (TE) expression to the transcriptome. In both scRNA-seq and bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantification of TE expression is challenging due to repetitive sequence content and poorly characterized TE gene models. Here, we developed a tool and analysis pipeline for Single cell Transposable Element Locus Level Analysis of scRNA Sequencing (Stellarscope) that reassigns multi-mapped reads to specific genomic loci using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Using Stellarscope, we built an atlas of TE expression in human PBMCs. We found that locus-specific TEs delineate cell types and define new cell subsets not identified by standard mRNA expression profiles. Altogether, this study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of transposable elements in human biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDNA methylation in the form of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most abundant base modification in animals. However, 5mC levels vary widely across taxa. While vertebrate genomes are hypermethylated, in most invertebrates, 5mC concentrates on constantly and highly transcribed genes (gene body methylation; GbM) and, in some species, on transposable elements (TEs), a pattern known as  mosaic. Yet, the role and developmental dynamics of 5mC and how these explain interspecific differences in DNA methylation patterns remain poorly understood, especially in Spiralia, a large clade of invertebrates comprising nearly half of the animal phyla.

ResultsHere, we generate base-resolution methylomes for three species with distinct genomic features and phylogenetic positions in Annelida, a major spiralian phylum. All possible 5mC patterns occur in annelids, from typical invertebrate intermediate levels in a mosaic distribution to hypermethylation and methylation loss. GbM is common to annelids with 5mC, and methylation differences across species are explained by taxon-specific transcriptional dynamics or the presence of intronic TEs. Notably, the link between GbM and transcription decays during development, and there is a gradual and global, age-dependent demethylation in adult stages. Moreover, reducing 5mC levels with cytidine analogues during early development impairs normal embryogenesis and reactivates TEs in the annelid Owenia fusiformis.

ConclusionsOur study indicates that global epigenetic erosion during development and ageing is an ancestral feature of bilateral animals. However, the tight link between transcription and gene body methylation is likely important in early embryonic stages, and 5mC-mediated TE silencing probably emerged convergently across animal lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A large-scale comparative genomic analysis was conducted for the global human fungal pathogens within the Cryptococcus genus, compared to non-pathogenic Cryptococcus species, and related species from the sister genus Kwoniella. Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for multiple species of both genera, resulting in a dataset encompassing virtually all of their known diversity. Although Cryptococcus and Kwoniella have comparable genome sizes (about 19.2 and 22.9 Mb) and similar gene content, hinting at pre-adaptive pathogenic potential, our analysis found evidence in pathogenic Cryptococcus species of specific examples of gene gain (via horizontal gene transfer) and gene loss, which might represent evolutionary signatures of pathogenic development. Genome analysis also revealed a significant variation in chromosome number and structure between the two genera. By combining synteny analysis and experimental centromere validation, we found that most Cryptococcus species have 14 chromosomes, whereas most Kwoniella species have fewer (11, 8, 5 or even as few as 3). Reduced chromosome number in Kwoniella is associated with formation of giant chromosomes (up to 18 Mb) through repeated chromosome fusion events, each marked by a pericentric inversion and centromere loss. While similar chromosome inversion-fusion patterns were observed in all Kwoniella species with fewer than 14 chromosomes, no such pattern was detected in Cryptococcus. Instead, Cryptococcus species with less than 14 chromosomes, underwent chromosome reductions primarily through rearrangements associated with the loss of repeat-rich centromeres. Additionally, Cryptococcus genomes exhibited frequent interchromosomal translocations, including intercentromeric recombination facilitated by transposons shared between centromeres. Taken together, our findings advance our understanding of genomic changes possibly associated with pathogenicity in Cryptococcus and provide a foundation to elucidate mechanisms of centromere loss and chromosome fusion driving distinct karyotypes in closely related fungal species, including prominent global human pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic sequence-to-activity models are increasingly utilized to understand gene regulatory syntax and probe the functional consequences of regulatory variation. Current models make accurate predictions of relative activity levels across the human reference genome, but their performance is more limited for predicting the effects of genetic variants, such as explaining gene expression variation across individuals. To better understand the causes of these shortcomings, we examine the uncertainty in predictions of genomic sequence-to-activity models using an ensemble of Basenji2 model replicates. We characterize prediction consistency on four types of sequences: reference genome sequences, reference genome sequences perturbed with TF motifs, eQTLs, and personal genome sequences. We observe that models tend to make high-confidence predictions on reference sequences, even when incorrect, and low-confidence predictions on sequences with variants. For eQTLs and personal genome sequences, we find that model replicates make inconsistent predictions in &gt;50% of cases. Our findings suggest strategies to improve performance of these models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce MnM, an efficient tool for characterising single-cell DNA replication states and revealing genomic subpopulations in heterogeneous samples, notably cancers. MnM uses sin-gle-cell copy-number data to accurately perform missing-value imputation, classify cell repli-cation states and detect genomic heterogeneity, which allows to separate somatic copy-num-ber alterations from copy-number variations due to DNA replication. By applying our machine learning methods, our research unveils critical insights into chromosomal aberrations and showcases ubiquitous aneuploidy in tumorigenesis. MnM democratises single-cell subpopu-lation detection which, in hand, enables the extraction of single-cell DNA replication timing (scRT) profiles from genomically-heterogenous subpopulations detected by DNA content and issued from single samples. By analysing over 119,000 human single cells from cultured cell lines, patient tumours as well as patient-derived xenograft samples, the copy-number and rep-lication timing profiles issued in this study lead to the first multi-sample subpopulation-disen-tangled scRT atlas and act as data contribution for further cancer research. Our results high-light the necessity of studying in vivo samples to comprehensively grasp the complexities of DNA replication, given that cell lines, while convenient, lack dynamic environmental factors. This tool offers to advance our understanding of cancer initiation and progression, facilitating further research in the interface of genomic instability and replication stress.

        <p class="abstract">Gene expression is controlled by the dynamic localization of thousands of distinct regulatory proteins to precise regions of DNA. Understanding this cell-type specific process has been a goal of molecular biology for decades yet remains challenging because most current DNA-protein mapping methods study one protein at a time. To overcome this, we developed ChIP-DIP (ChIP Done In Parallel), a split-pool based method that enables simultaneous, genome-wide mapping of hundreds of diverse regulatory proteins in a single experiment. We demonstrate that ChIP-DIP generates highly accurate maps for all classes of DNA-associated proteins, including histone modifications, chromatin regulators, transcription factors, and RNA Polymerases. Using these data, we explore quantitative combinations of protein localization on genomic DNA to define distinct classes of regulatory elements and their functional activity. Our data demonstrate that ChIP-DIP enables the generation of  consortium level, context-specific protein localization maps within any molecular biology lab.</p>
