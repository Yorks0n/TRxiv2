Here we describe Splice Editing, a generalizable platform to correct gene transcripts in situ by programmable insertion or replacement of large RNA segments. By combining CRISPR-mediated RNA targeting with endogenous cellular RNA-splicing machinery, Splice Editing enables efficient, precise, and programmable large-scale editing of gene targets without DNA cleavage or mutagenesis. RNA sequencing and measurement of spliced protein products confirm that Splice Editing achieves efficient and specific targeted RNA and protein correction. We show that Splice Editors based on novel miniature RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems discovered and characterized in this work can be packaged for effective delivery to human cells and affect different types of edits across multiple targets and cell lines. By editing thousands of bases simultaneously in a single reversible step, Splice Editing could expand the treatable disease population for monogenic diseases with large allelic diversity without the permanent unintended effects of DNA editing. One-sentence summaryCRISPR-guided trans-splicing enables efficient and specific recombination of large RNA molecules in mammalian cells, with broad applications in therapeutic development for genetic diseases and as a research tool for the study of basic RNA biology.\nMapping the Genetic Interaction Network of PARP inhibitor Response\nAuthors: Simpson, D.; Ling, J.; Jing, Y.; Adamson, B.\nScore: 35.7, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553986\nGenetic interactions have long informed our understanding of the coordinated proteins and pathways that respond to DNA damage in mammalian cells, but systematic interrogation of the genetic network underlying that system has yet to be achieved. Towards this goal, we measured 147,153 pairwise interactions among genes implicated in PARP inhibitor (PARPi) response. Evaluating genetic interactions at this scale, with and without exposure to PARPi, revealed hierarchical organization of the pathways and complexes that maintain genome stability during normal growth and defined changes that occur upon accumulation of DNA lesions due to cytotoxic doses of PARPi. We uncovered unexpected relationships among DNA repair genes, including context-specific buffering interactions between the minimally characterized AUNIP and BRCA1-A complex genes. Our work thus establishes a foundation for mapping differential genetic interactions in mammalian cells and provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of DNA repair and PARP inhibitors.\nA genome-wide atlas of human cell morphology\nAuthors: Ramezani, M.; Bauman, J.; Singh, A.; Weisbart, E.; Yong, J.; Lozada, M.

T.\nScore: 65.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552164\nA key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing data-driven representations of gene function. Here, we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-scale genotype-phenotype maps comprising \u003e20,000 single-gene CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout experiments in \u003e30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling approach (PERISCOPE) combines a de-stainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting1,2) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This approach provides high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells, while simultaneously enabling interrogation of subcellular processes. Our atlas reconstructs known pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, identifies culture media-specific responses to gene knockout, and clusters thousands of human genes by phenotypic similarity. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly-characterized disease-associated transmembrane protein TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, showing the power of these representations. In sum, our atlas and screening technology represent a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale.\nEnvironmental challenge rewires functional connections among human genes\nAuthors: Herken, B. W.; Wong, G.; Norman, T.; Gilbert, L.\nScore: 23.7, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552346\nA fundamental question in biology is how a limited number of genes combinatorially govern cellular responses to environmental changes. While the prevailing hypothesis is that relationships between genes, processes, and ontologies could be plastic to achieve this adaptability, quantitatively comparing human gene functional connections between specific environmental conditions at scale is very challenging. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how human genetic interaction networks are rewired in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed a framework for mapping context-specific genetic interactions, enabling us to measure the plasticity of human genetic architecture upon environmental challenge for [~]250,000 interactions, using cell cycle interruption, genotoxic perturbation, and nutrient deprivation as archetypes. We discover large-scale rewiring of human gene relationships across conditions, highlighted by dramatic shifts in the functional connections of epigenetic regulators (TIP60), cell cycle regulators (PP2A), and glycolysis metabolism. Our study demonstrates that upon environmental perturbation, intra-complex genetic rewiring is rare while inter-complex rewiring is common, suggesting a modular and flexible evolutionary genetic strategy that allows a limited number of human genes to enable adaptation to a large number of environmental conditions. One Sentence SummaryFive human genetic interaction maps reveal how the landscape of genes functional relationships is rewired as cells experience environmental stress to DNA integrity, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism.\n16S rRNA phylogeny and clustering is not a reliable proxy for genome-based taxonomy in Streptomyces\nAuthors: Kiepas, A. B.; Hoskisson, P. A.; Pritchard, L.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553377\nAlthough Streptomyces is one of the most extensively studied genera of bacteria, their taxonomy remains contested and is suspected to contain significant species-level misclassification. Resolving the classification of Streptomyces would benefit many areas of study and applied microbiology that rely heavily on having an accurate ground truth classification of similar and dissimilar organisms, including comparative genomics-based searches for novel antimicrobials in the fight against the ongoing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. To attempt a resolution, we investigate taxonomic conflicts between 16S rRNA and whole genome classifications using all available 48,981 full-length 16S rRNA Streptomyces sequences from the combined SILVA, Greengenes, Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) databases, and 2,276 publicly available Streptomyces genome assemblies. We construct a 16S gene tree for 14,239 distinct Streptomyces 16S rRNA sequences, identifying three major lineages of Streptomyces, and find that existing taxonomic classifications are inconsistent with the tree topology. We also use these data to delineate 16S and whole genome landscapes for Streptomyces, finding that 16S and whole-genome classifications of Streptomyces strains are frequently in disagreement, and in particular that 16S zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) are often inconsistent with Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI)-based taxonomy. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence data does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and we propose that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community for classification and metabarcoding. As much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data and may in parts be in error, we also propose that reclassification of the genus by alternative approaches is required. Impact StatementAccurate classification of microbes, usually in the form of taxonomic assignments, provides a fundamental ground truth or reference point for many aspects of applied microbiology including comparative genomics, identification of strains for natural product discovery, and dereplication of strains. Bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces are an important source of bioactive metabolites and enzymes in biotechnology, and proper understanding of their phylogeny aids understanding of the evolution of industrially important gene products and metabolites, and prioritization of strains for industrial exploitation. Taxonomic classification in the genus Streptomyces is complex and contested, and there are clear conflicts between taxonomies inferred from 16S rRNA and from whole genome sequences. Despite this, 16S sequence-based classifications are still widely used to infer taxonomic identity, to determine community composition, and to prioritise strains for study. We investigate a diverse and comprehensive set of Streptomyces genomes using whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and 16S sequence analysis to delineate and compare classifications made using these approaches. We outline the genomic and 16S sequence landscape of Streptomyces, demonstrating that (i) distinct taxonomic species may share identical full-length 16S sequences, and (ii) in some instances, isolates representing the same taxonomic species do not share any common 16S rRNA sequence. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence variation does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community. Much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data, and we therefore propose that reclassification within this group by alternative approaches is required.

C.; Cohen, B. A.; White, M. A.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554146\nCis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct gene expression in health and disease, and models that can accurately predict their activities from DNA sequences are crucial for biomedicine. Deep learning represents one emerging strategy to model the regulatory grammar that relates CRE sequence to function. However, these models require training data on a scale that exceeds the number of CREs in the genome. We address this problem using active machine learning to iteratively train models on multiple rounds of synthetic DNA sequences assayed in live mammalian retinas. During each round of training the model actively selects sequence perturbations to assay, thereby efficiently generating informative training data. We iteratively trained a model that predicts the activities of sequences containing binding motifs for the photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) using an order of magnitude less training data than current approaches. The model's internal confidence estimates of its predictions are reliable guides for designing sequences with high activity. The model correctly identified critical sequence differences between active and inactive sequences with nearly identical transcription factor binding sites, and revealed order and spacing preferences for combinations of motifs. Our results establish active learning as an effective method to train accurate deep learning models of cis-regulatory function after exhausting naturally occurring training examples in the genome.\nMapping Human Tissues with Highly Multiplexed RNA in situ Hybridization\nAuthors: Kalhor, K.; Chen, C.-j.; Lee, H. S.; Cai, M.; Nafisi, M.; Que, R.; Palmer, C.; Yuan, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Song, J.; Knoten, A.; Lake, B.; Gaut, J.; Keene, D.; Lein, E.; Kharchenko, P.; Chun, J.; Jain, S.; Fan, J.-B.; Zhang, K.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553610\nIn situ transcriptomic techniques promise a holistic view of tissue organization and cell-cell interactions. Recently there has been a surge of multiplexed RNA in situ techniques but their application to human tissues and clinical biopsies has been limited due to their large size, general lower tissue quality and high background autofluorescence. Here we report DART-FISH, a versatile padlock probe-based technology capable of profiling hundreds to thousands of genes in centimeter-sized human tissue sections at cellular resolution. We introduced an omni-cell type cytoplasmic stain, dubbed RiboSoma that substantially improves the segmentation of cell bodies. We developed a computational decoding-by-deconvolution workflow to extract gene spots even in the presence of optical crowding. Our enzyme-free isothermal decoding procedure allowed us to image 121 genes in a large section from the human neocortex in less than 10 hours, where we successfully recapitulated the cytoarchitecture of 20 neuronal and non-neuronal subclasses. Additionally, we demonstrated the detection of transcripts as short as 461 nucleotides, including neuropeptides and discovered new cortical layer markers. We further performed in situ mapping of 300 genes on a diseased human kidney, profiled \u003e20 healthy and pathological cell states, and identified diseased niches enriched in transcriptionally altered epithelial cells and myofibroblasts.\nReconstructing the genetic relationship between ancient and present-day Siberian populations\nAuthors: Gill, H.; Lee, J.; Jeong, C.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554074\nHuman populations across a vast area in northern Eurasia, from Fennoscandia to Chukotka, share a distinct genetic component often referred to as the Siberian ancestry. Most enriched in present-day Samoyedic-speaking populations such as Nganasans, its origins and history still remain elusive despite the growing list of ancient and present-day genomes from Siberia. Here we reanalyze published ancient and present-day Siberian genomes focusing on the Baikal and Yakutia, resolving key questions regarding their genetic history. First, we show a long-term presence of a unique genetic profile in southern Siberia, up to 6,000 years ago, which distinctly shares a deep ancestral connection with Native Americans. Second, in the Baikal we find no direct contribution of the Early Neolithic Kitoi people to Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Serovo-Glazkovo ones. Third, the Middle Neolithic individual from Yakutia, belonging to the Belkachi culture, serves as the best source so far available for the spread of the Siberian ancestry into Fennoscandia and Greenland. These findings shed light on the genetic legacy of the Siberian ancestry and provide insights into the complex interplay between different populations in northern Eurasia throughout history.\nR2C2+UMI: Combining concatemeric consensus sequencing with unique molecular identifiers enables ultra-accurate sequencing of amplicons on Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers\nAuthors: Deng, D. Z. Q.; Verhage, J.; Neudorf, C.; Corbett-Detig, R.; Mekonen, H.; Castaldi, P. J.; Vollmers, C.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553937\nThe sequencing of PCR amplicons is a core application of high-throughput sequencing technology. Using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), individual amplified molecules can be sequenced to very high accuracy on an Illumina sequencer. However, Illumina sequencers have limited read length and are therefore restricted to sequencing amplicons shorter than 600bp unless using inefficient synthetic long-read approaches. Native long-read sequencers from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can, using consensus read approaches, match or exceed Illumina quality while achieving much longer read lengths. Using a circularization-based concatemeric consensus sequencing approach (R2C2) paired with UMIs (R2C2+UMI) we show that we can sequence ~550nt antibody heavy-chain (IGH) and ~1500nt 16S amplicons at accuracies up to and exceeding Q50 (\u003c1 error in 100,0000 sequenced bases), which exceeds accuracies of UMI-supported Illumina paired sequencing as well as synthetic long-read approaches.\nA Pooled Cell Painting CRISPR Screening Platform Enables de novo Inference of Gene Function by Self-supervised Deep Learning\nAuthors: Sivanandan, S.; Leitmann, B.; Lubeck, E.; Sultan, M. M.; Stanitsas, P.; Ranu, N.; Ewer, A.; Mancuso, J. E.; Phillips, Z. F.; Kim, A.; Bisognano, J. W.; Cesarek, J.; Ruggiu, F.; Feldman, D.; Koller, D.; Sharon, E.; Kaykas, A.; Salick, M. R.; Chu, C.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553051\nPooled CRISPR screening has emerged as a powerful method of mapping gene functions thanks to its scalability, affordability, and robustness against well or plate-specific confounders present in array-based screening 1-6. Most pooled CRISPR screens assay for low dimensional phenotypes (e.g. fitness, fluorescent markers). Higher-dimensional assays such as perturb-seq are available but costly and only applicable to transcriptomics readouts 7-11. Recently, pooled optical screening, which combines pooled CRISPR screening and microscopy-based assays, has been demonstrated in the studies of the NFkB pathway, essential human genes, cytoskeletal organization and antiviral response 12-15. While the pooled optical screening methodology is scalable and information-rich, the applications thus far employ hypothesis-specific assays. Here, we enable hypothesis-free reverse genetic screening for generic morphological phenotypes by re-engineering the Cell Painting 16 technique to provide compatibility with pooled optical screening. We validated this technique using well-defined morphological genesets (124 genes), compared classical image analysis and self-supervised learning methods using a mechanism-of-action (MoA) library (300 genes), and performed discovery screening with a druggable genome library (1640 genes) 17. Across these three experiments we show that the combination of rich morphological data and deep learning allows gene networks to emerge without the need for target-specific biomarkers, leading to better discovery of gene functions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Current gene editing approaches in eukaryotic cells are limited to single base edits or small DNA insertions and deletions, and remain encumbered by unintended permanent effects and significant challenges in the delivery of large DNA cargo. Here we describe Splice Editing, a generalizable platform to correct gene transcripts in situ by programmable insertion or replacement of large RNA segments. By combining CRISPR-mediated RNA targeting with endogenous cellular RNA-splicing machinery, Splice Editing enables efficient, precise, and programmable large-scale editing of gene targets without DNA cleavage or mutagenesis. RNA sequencing and measurement of spliced protein products confirm that Splice Editing achieves efficient and specific targeted RNA and protein correction. We show that Splice Editors based on novel miniature RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems discovered and characterized in this work can be packaged for effective delivery to human cells and affect different types of edits across multiple targets and cell lines. By editing thousands of bases simultaneously in a single reversible step, Splice Editing could expand the treatable disease population for monogenic diseases with large allelic diversity without the permanent unintended effects of DNA editing.

        <p class="abstract">Genetic interactions have long informed our understanding of the coordinated proteins and pathways that respond to DNA damage in mammalian cells, but systematic interrogation of the genetic network underlying that system has yet to be achieved. Towards this goal, we measured 147,153 pairwise interactions among genes implicated in PARP inhibitor (PARPi) response. Evaluating genetic interactions at this scale, with and without exposure to PARPi, revealed hierarchical organization of the pathways and complexes that maintain genome stability during normal growth and defined changes that occur upon accumulation of DNA lesions due to cytotoxic doses of PARPi. We uncovered unexpected relationships among DNA repair genes, including context-specific buffering interactions between the minimally characterized AUNIP and BRCA1-A complex genes. Our work thus establishes a foundation for mapping differential genetic interactions in mammalian cells and provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of DNA repair and PARP inhibitors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing data-driven representations of gene function. Here, we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-scale genotype-phenotype maps comprising &gt;20,000 single-gene CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout experiments in &gt;30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling approach (PERISCOPE) combines a de-stainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting1,2) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This approach provides high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells, while simultaneously enabling interrogation of subcellular processes. Our atlas reconstructs known pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, identifies culture media-specific responses to gene knockout, and clusters thousands of human genes by phenotypic similarity. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly-characterized disease-associated transmembrane protein TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, showing the power of these representations. In sum, our atlas and screening technology represent a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A fundamental question in biology is how a limited number of genes combinatorially govern cellular responses to environmental changes. While the prevailing hypothesis is that relationships between genes, processes, and ontologies could be plastic to achieve this adaptability, quantitatively comparing human gene functional connections between specific environmental conditions at scale is very challenging. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how human genetic interaction networks are rewired in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed a framework for mapping context-specific genetic interactions, enabling us to measure the plasticity of human genetic architecture upon environmental challenge for [~]250,000 interactions, using cell cycle interruption, genotoxic perturbation, and nutrient deprivation as archetypes. We discover large-scale rewiring of human gene relationships across conditions, highlighted by dramatic shifts in the functional connections of epigenetic regulators (TIP60), cell cycle regulators (PP2A), and glycolysis metabolism. Our study demonstrates that upon environmental perturbation, intra-complex genetic rewiring is rare while inter-complex rewiring is common, suggesting a modular and flexible evolutionary genetic strategy that allows a limited number of human genes to enable adaptation to a large number of environmental conditions.

        <p class="abstract">Although Streptomyces is one of the most extensively studied genera of bacteria, their taxonomy remains contested and is suspected to contain significant species-level misclassification. Resolving the classification of Streptomyces would benefit many areas of study and applied microbiology that rely heavily on having an accurate ground truth classification of similar and dissimilar organisms, including comparative genomics-based searches for novel antimicrobials in the fight against the ongoing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. To attempt a resolution, we investigate taxonomic conflicts between 16S rRNA and whole genome classifications using all available 48,981 full-length 16S rRNA Streptomyces sequences from the combined SILVA, Greengenes, Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) databases, and 2,276 publicly available Streptomyces genome assemblies. We construct a 16S gene tree for 14,239 distinct Streptomyces 16S rRNA sequences, identifying three major lineages of Streptomyces, and find that existing taxonomic classifications are inconsistent with the tree topology. We also use these data to delineate 16S and whole genome landscapes for Streptomyces, finding that 16S and whole-genome classifications of Streptomyces strains are frequently in disagreement, and in particular that 16S zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) are often inconsistent with Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI)-based taxonomy. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence data does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and we propose that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community for classification and metabarcoding. As much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data and may in parts be in error, we also propose that reclassification of the genus by alternative approaches is required.

Impact StatementAccurate classification of microbes, usually in the form of taxonomic assignments, provides a fundamental ground truth or reference point for many aspects of applied microbiology including comparative genomics, identification of strains for natural product discovery, and dereplication of strains. Bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces are an important source of bioactive metabolites and enzymes in biotechnology, and proper understanding of their phylogeny aids understanding of the evolution of industrially important gene products and metabolites, and prioritization of strains for industrial exploitation. Taxonomic classification in the genus Streptomyces is complex and contested, and there are clear conflicts between taxonomies inferred from 16S rRNA and from whole genome sequences. Despite this, 16S sequence-based classifications are still widely used to infer taxonomic identity, to determine community composition, and to prioritise strains for study. We investigate a diverse and comprehensive set of Streptomyces genomes using whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and 16S sequence analysis to delineate and compare classifications made using these approaches. We outline the genomic and 16S sequence landscape of Streptomyces, demonstrating that (i) distinct taxonomic species may share identical full-length 16S sequences, and (ii) in some instances, isolates representing the same taxonomic species do not share any common 16S rRNA sequence. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence variation does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community. Much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data, and we therefore propose that reclassification within this group by alternative approaches is required.

        <p class="abstract">Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct gene expression in health and disease, and models that can accurately predict their activities from DNA sequences are crucial for biomedicine. Deep learning represents one emerging strategy to model the regulatory grammar that relates CRE sequence to function. However, these models require training data on a scale that exceeds the number of CREs in the genome. We address this problem using active machine learning to iteratively train models on multiple rounds of synthetic DNA sequences assayed in live mammalian retinas. During each round of training the model actively selects sequence perturbations to assay, thereby efficiently generating informative training data. We iteratively trained a model that predicts the activities of sequences containing binding motifs for the photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) using an order of magnitude less training data than current approaches. The model&#39;s internal confidence estimates of its predictions are reliable guides for designing sequences with high activity. The model correctly identified critical sequence differences between active and inactive sequences with nearly identical transcription factor binding sites, and revealed order and spacing preferences for combinations of motifs. Our results establish active learning as an effective method to train accurate deep learning models of cis-regulatory function after exhausting naturally occurring training examples in the genome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In situ transcriptomic techniques promise a holistic view of tissue organization and cell-cell interactions. Recently there has been a surge of multiplexed RNA in situ techniques but their application to human tissues and clinical biopsies has been limited due to their large size, general lower tissue quality and high background autofluorescence. Here we report DART-FISH, a versatile padlock probe-based technology capable of profiling hundreds to thousands of genes in centimeter-sized human tissue sections at cellular resolution. We introduced an omni-cell type cytoplasmic stain, dubbed RiboSoma that substantially improves the segmentation of cell bodies. We developed a computational decoding-by-deconvolution workflow to extract gene spots even in the presence of optical crowding. Our enzyme-free isothermal decoding procedure allowed us to image 121 genes in a large section from the human neocortex in less than 10 hours, where we successfully recapitulated the cytoarchitecture of 20 neuronal and non-neuronal subclasses. Additionally, we demonstrated the detection of transcripts as short as 461 nucleotides, including neuropeptides and discovered new cortical layer markers. We further performed in situ mapping of 300 genes on a diseased human kidney, profiled &gt;20 healthy and pathological cell states, and identified diseased niches enriched in transcriptionally altered epithelial cells and myofibroblasts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human populations across a vast area in northern Eurasia, from Fennoscandia to Chukotka, share a distinct genetic component often referred to as the Siberian ancestry. Most enriched in present-day Samoyedic-speaking populations such as Nganasans, its origins and history still remain elusive despite the growing list of ancient and present-day genomes from Siberia. Here we reanalyze published ancient and present-day Siberian genomes focusing on the Baikal and Yakutia, resolving key questions regarding their genetic history. First, we show a long-term presence of a unique genetic profile in southern Siberia, up to 6,000 years ago, which distinctly shares a deep ancestral connection with Native Americans. Second, in the Baikal we find no direct contribution of the Early Neolithic Kitoi people to Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Serovo-Glazkovo ones. Third, the Middle Neolithic individual from Yakutia, belonging to the Belkachi culture, serves as the best source so far available for the spread of the Siberian ancestry into Fennoscandia and Greenland. These findings shed light on the genetic legacy of the Siberian ancestry and provide insights into the complex interplay between different populations in northern Eurasia throughout history.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The sequencing of PCR amplicons is a core application of high-throughput sequencing technology. Using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), individual amplified molecules can be sequenced to very high accuracy on an Illumina sequencer. However, Illumina sequencers have limited read length and are therefore restricted to sequencing amplicons shorter than 600bp unless using inefficient synthetic long-read approaches. Native long-read sequencers from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can, using consensus read approaches, match or exceed Illumina quality while achieving much longer read lengths. Using a circularization-based concatemeric consensus sequencing approach (R2C2) paired with UMIs (R2C2&#43;UMI) we show that we can sequence ~550nt antibody heavy-chain (IGH) and ~1500nt 16S amplicons at accuracies up to and exceeding Q50 (&lt;1 error in 100,0000 sequenced bases), which exceeds accuracies of UMI-supported Illumina paired sequencing as well as synthetic long-read approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pooled CRISPR screening has emerged as a powerful method of mapping gene functions thanks to its scalability, affordability, and robustness against well or plate-specific confounders present in array-based screening 1-6. Most pooled CRISPR screens assay for low dimensional phenotypes (e.g. fitness, fluorescent markers). Higher-dimensional assays such as perturb-seq are available but costly and only applicable to transcriptomics readouts 7-11. Recently, pooled optical screening, which combines pooled CRISPR screening and microscopy-based assays, has been demonstrated in the studies of the NFkB pathway, essential human genes, cytoskeletal organization and antiviral response 12-15. While the pooled optical screening methodology is scalable and information-rich, the applications thus far employ hypothesis-specific assays. Here, we enable hypothesis-free reverse genetic screening for generic morphological phenotypes by re-engineering the Cell Painting 16 technique to provide compatibility with pooled optical screening. We validated this technique using well-defined morphological genesets (124 genes), compared classical image analysis and self-supervised learning methods using a mechanism-of-action (MoA) library (300 genes), and performed discovery screening with a druggable genome library (1640 genes) 17. Across these three experiments we show that the combination of rich morphological data and deep learning allows gene networks to emerge without the need for target-specific biomarkers, leading to better discovery of gene functions.</p>
