M.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561663\nActivation of the p53 tumor suppressor triggers a transcriptional program to control cellular response to stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 controls gene transcription are not completely understood. Here, using a multi-omics integration framework, we uncover the critical role of spatio-temporal genome architecture in this process. We demonstrate that p53 drives direct and indirect changes in genome compartments, topologically associating domains and DNA loops within minutes of its activation, which escort the p53 transcriptional program along time. Focused on p53-bound enhancers, we report a core transcriptional program of 340 genes directly regulated by p53 over distance, most of these not previously identified. Finally, we showcase that p53 controls transcription of distal genes through newly formed and pre-existing enhancer-promoter loops in a cohesin dependent manner. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated architectural role of p53 as regulator at distinct topological layers and provide a reliable set of new p53 direct target genes that may help future designs of p53-based cancer therapies.\nDevelopmental and housekeeping transcriptional programs display distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity in Drosophila\nAuthors: LOUBIERE, V.; de Almeida, B. P.; Pagani, M.; Stark, A.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561770\nGenomic enhancers are key transcriptional regulators which, upon the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors, activate their cognate target promoters. Although enhancers have been extensively studied in isolation, a substantial number of genes have more than one simultaneously active enhancer, and it remains unclear how these cooperate to regulate transcription. Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model, we assay the activities of more than a thousand individual enhancers and a million enhancer pairs towards housekeeping and developmental core promoters with STARR-seq. We report that housekeeping and developmental enhancers show distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity: while housekeeping enhancers are additive such that their combined activity mirrors the sum of their individual activities, developmental enhancers are synergistic and follow a multiplicative model of cooperativity. This developmental enhancer synergy is promiscuous and neither depends on the enhancers' endogenous genomic contexts nor on specific transcription factor motif signatures, but it saturates for the highest levels of enhancer activity. These results have important implications for our understanding of gene-regulation in complex multi-enhancer loci and genomically clustered housekeeping genes, providing a rationale for strong and mild transcriptional effects of mutations within enhancer regions.\nThe single-molecule accessibility landscape of newly replicated mammalian chromatin\nAuthors: Ostrowski, M. S.; Yang, M. G.; McNally, C. P.; Abdulhay, N. J.; Wang, S.; Nora, E. P.; Goodarzi, H.; Ramani, V.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561582\nThe higher-order structure of newly replicated (i.e. nascent) chromatin fibers remains poorly-resolved, limiting our understanding of how epigenomes are maintained across cell divisions. To address this, we present Replication-Aware Single-molecule Accessibility Mapping (RASAM), a long-read sequencing method that nondestructively measures genome-wide replication-status and protein-DNA interactions simultaneously on intact chromatin templates. We report that individual human and mouse nascent chromatin fibers are hyperaccessible compared to steady-state chromatin. This hyperaccessibility occurs at two, coupled length-scales: first, individual nucleosome core particles on nascent DNA exist as a mixture of partially-unwrapped nucleosomes and other subnucleosomal species; second, newly-replicated chromatin fibers are significantly enriched for irregularly-spaced nucleosomes on individual DNA molecules. Focusing on specific cis-regulatory elements (e.g. transcription factor binding sites; active transcription start sites [TSSs]), we discover unique modes by which nascent chromatin hyperaccessibility is resolved at the single-molecule level: at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, CTCF and nascent nucleosomes compete for motifs on nascent chromatin fibers, resulting in quantitatively-reduced CTCF occupancy and motif accessibility post-replication; at active TSSs, high levels of steady-state chromatin accessibility are preserved, implying that nucleosome free regions (NFRs) are rapidly re-established behind the fork. Our study introduces a new paradigm for studying higher-order chromatin fiber organization behind the replication fork. More broadly, we uncover a unique organization of newly replicated chromatin that must be reset by active processes, providing a substrate for epigenetic reprogramming.\nNon-coding variants impact cis-regulatory coordination in a cell type-specific manner\nAuthors: Pushkarev, O.; van Mierlo, G.; Kribelbauer, J. F.; Saelens, W.; Gardeux, V.; Deplancke, B.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561870\nBACKGROUNDInteractions among cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a crucial role in gene regulation. Various approaches have been developed to map these interactions genome-wide, including those relying on interindividual epigenomic variation to identify groups of covariable regulatory elements, referred to as chromatin modules (CMs). While CM mapping allows to investigate the relationship between chromatin modularity and gene expression, the computational principles used for CM identification vary in their application and outcomes. RESULTSWe comprehensively evaluate and streamline existing CM mapping tools and present guidelines for optimal utilization of epigenome data from a diverse population of individuals to assess regulatory coordination across the human genome. We showcase the effectiveness of our recommended practices by analysing distinct cell types and demonstrate cell type-specificity of CRE interactions in CMs and their relevance for gene expression. Integration of genotype information revealed that many non-coding disease-associated variants affect the activity of CMs in a cell type-specific manner by affecting the binding of cell type-specific transcription factors. We provide example cases that illustrate in detail how CMs can be used to deconstruct GWAS loci, understand variable expression of cell surface receptors in immune cells and reveal how genetic variation can impact the expression of prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CONCLUSIONSOur study presents an optimal strategy for CM mapping, and reveals how CMs capture the coordination of CREs and its impact on gene expression. Non-coding genetic variants can disrupt this coordination, and we highlight how this may lead to disease predisposition in a cell type-specific manner.\nEpigenetic context predicts gene expression variation and reproductive traits across genetically identical individuals\nAuthors: Webster, A. K.; Willis, J. H.; Johnson, E.; Sarkies, P.; Phillips, P. C.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562270\nIn recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been the major approach to understand the biological basis of individual differences in traits and diseases. However, GWAS approaches have proven to have limited predictive power to explain individual differences, particularly for complex traits and diseases in which environmental factors play a substantial role in their etiology. Indeed, individual differences persist even in genetically identical individuals, although fully separating genetic and environmental causation is difficult or impossible in most organisms. To understand the basis of individual differences in the absence of genetic differences, we measured two quantitative reproductive traits in 180 genetically identical young adult Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms in a shared environment and performed single-individual transcriptomics on each worm. We identified hundreds of genes for which expression variation was strongly associated with reproductive traits, some of which depended on prior environmental experience and some of which was random. Multiple small sets of genes together were highly predictive of reproductive traits across individuals, explaining on average over half and over a quarter of variation in the two traits. We manipulated mRNA levels of predictive genes using RNA interference to identify a set of causal genes, demonstrating the utility of this approach for both prediction and understanding underlying biology. Finally, we found that the chromatin environment of predictive genes was enriched for H3K27 trimethylation, suggesting that individual gene expression differences underlying critical traits may be driven in part by chromatin structure. Together, this work shows that individual differences in gene expression that arise independently of underlying genetic differences are both predictive and causal in shaping reproductive traits at levels that equal or exceed genetic variation.\nThe European Reference Genome Atlas: piloting a decentralised approach to equitable biodiversity genomics\nAuthors: Mc Cartney, A.

However, regardless of the major advances in genome sequencing technologies, only a tiny fraction of species have genomic information available. To contribute to a more complete planetary genomic database, scientists and institutions across the world have united under the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which plans to sequence and assemble high-quality reference genomes for all [~]1.5 million recognized eukaryotic species through a stepwise phased approach. As the initiative transitions into Phase II, where 150,000 species are to be sequenced in just four years, worldwide participation in the project will be fundamental to success. As the European node of the EBP, the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) seeks to implement a new decentralised, accessible, equitable and inclusive model for producing high-quality reference genomes, which will inform EBP as it scales. To embark on this mission, ERGA launched a Pilot Project to establish a network across Europe to develop and test the first infrastructure of its kind for the coordinated and distributed reference genome production on 98 European eukaryotic species from sample providers across 33 European countries. Here we outline the process and challenges faced during the development of a pilot infrastructure for the production of reference genome resources, and explore the effectiveness of this approach in terms of high-quality reference genome production, considering also equity and inclusion. The outcomes and lessons learned during this pilot provide a solid foundation for ERGA while offering key learnings to other transnational and national genomic resource projects.\nPostglacial genomes from foragers across Northern Eurasia reveal prehistoric mobility associated with the spread of the Uralic and Yeniseian languages\nAuthors: Zeng, T.

S.; Slepchenko, S. M.\nScore: 47.8, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560332\nThe North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples. We present genome-wide ancient DNA data for 181 individuals from this region spanning the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age. We find that Early to Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherer populations from across the southern forest and forest-steppes of Northern Eurasia can be characterized by a continuous gradient of ancestry that remained stable for millennia, ranging from fully West Eurasian in the Baltic region to fully East Asian in the Transbaikal region. In contrast, cotemporaneous groups in far Northeast Siberia were genetically distinct, retaining high levels of continuity from a population that was the primary source of ancestry for Native Americans. By the mid-Holocene, admixture between this early Northeastern Siberian population and groups from Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin produced two distinctive populations in eastern Siberia that played an important role in the genetic formation of later people. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic-Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is found substantially only among Yeniseian-speaking groups and those known to have admixed with them. Ancestry from the second, Yakutian Late Neolithic-Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is strongly associated with present-day Uralic speakers. We show how Yakutia_LNBA ancestry spread from an east Siberian origin [~]4.5kya, along with subclades of Y-chromosome haplogroup N occurring at high frequencies among present-day Uralic speakers, into Western and Central Siberia in communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy: a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that spread explosively across an enormous region of Northern Eurasia [~]4.0kya. However, the ancestry of the 16 Seima-Turbino-period individuals--the first reported from sites with this metallurgy--was otherwise extraordinarily diverse, with partial descent from Indo-Iranian-speaking pastoralists and multiple hunter-gatherer populations from widely separated regions of Eurasia. Our results provide support for theories suggesting that early Uralic speakers at the beginning of their westward dispersal where involved in the expansion of Seima-Turbino metallurgical traditions, and suggests that both cultural transmission and migration were important in the spread of Seima-Turbino material culture.\nKeratinocytes Drive the Epithelial Hyperplasia Key to Sea Lice Resistance in Coho Salmon\nAuthors: Salisbury, S. J.; Ruiz Daniels, R.; Monaghan, S. J.; Bron, J. E.; Villamayor, P. R.; Gervais, O.; Fast, M. D.; Sveen, L.; Houston, R. D.; Robinson, N.; Robledo, D.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562030\nBackground: Salmonid species have followed markedly divergent evolutionary trajectories in their interactions with sea lice. While sea lice parasitism poses significant economic, environmental, and animal welfare challenges for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exhibit near-complete resistance to sea lice, achieved through a potent epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid louse detachment. The molecular mechanisms underlying these divergent responses to sea lice are unknown. Results: We characterised the cellular and molecular responses of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon to sea lice using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Juvenile fish were exposed to copepodid sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), and lice-attached pelvic fin and skin samples were collected 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, and 60h after exposure, along with control samples. Comparative analysis of control and treatment samples revealed an immune and wound-healing response that was common to both species, but attenuated in Atlantic salmon, potentially reflecting greater sea louse immunomodulation. Our results revealed unique but complementary roles of three layers of keratinocytes in the epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid sea lice rejection in coho salmon. Our results suggest that basal keratinocytes direct the expansion and mobility of intermediate and, especially, superficial keratinocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasite. Conclusion: Our results highlight the key role of keratinocytes to coho salmon's sea lice resistance, and the diverged biological response of the two salmonid host species when interacting with this parasite. This study has identified key pathways and candidate genes that could be manipulated using various biotechnological solutions to improve Atlantic salmon sea lice resistance.\nImproved Resolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Haemagglutinin Cleavage Site Using Oxford Nanopore R10 Sequencing Chemistry\nAuthors: Ratcliff, J.; Merritt, B.; Gooden, H.; Siegers, J.; Srikanth, A.; Yann, S.; Kol, S.; Sin, S.; Tok, S.; Karlsson, E. A.; Thielen, P. M.\nScore: 17.2, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560331\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses continue to pose global risks to One Health, including agriculture, public, and animal health. Rapid and accurate genomic surveillance is critical for monitoring viral mutations, tracing transmission, and guiding interventions in near real-time. Oxford Nanopore sequencing holds promise for real-time influenza genotyping, but data quality from R9 chemistry has limited its adoption due to challenges resolving low-complexity regions such as the biologically critical hemagglutinin cleavage site, a homopolymer of basic amino acids that distinguish highly pathogenic strains. In this study, human and avian influenza isolates (n=45) from Cambodia were sequenced using both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 flow cells and chemistries to evaluate performance between approaches. Overall, R10.4.1 yielded increased data output with higher average quality compared to R9.4.1, producing improved consensus sequences using a reference-based bioinformatics approach. R10.4.1 had significantly lower minor population insertion and deletion frequencies, driven by improved performance in low sequence complexity regions prone to insertion and deletion errors, such as homopolymers. Within the hemagglutinin cleavage site, R10.4.1 resolved the correct motif in 90% of genomes compared to only 60% with R9.4.1. Further examination showed reduced frameshift mutations in consensus sequences generated with R10.4.1 that could result in incorrectly classified virulence. Improved consensus genome quality from nanopore sequencing approaches, especially across biologically important low-complexity regions, is critical to reduce subjective hand-curation and will improve local and global genomic surveillance responses.\nInsights from Melipona bicolor hybrid genome assembly: A stingless bee genome with chromosome-level scaffold\nAuthors: Araujo, N. d. S.; Ogihara, F.; Mariano-Martins, P.; Arias, M. C.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561533\nBackgroundThe highly eusocial stingless bees are crucial pollinators of native and agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, genomic studies within this bee tribe remain scarce. We present the genome assembly of the stingless bee Melipona bicolor. This bee is a remarkable exception to the typical single-queen colony structure, since in this species, multiple queens may coexist and share reproductive duties, resulting in genetically diverse colonies with weak kinship connections. As the only known genuinely polygynous bee, M. bicolors genome provides a valuable resource for investigating sociality beyond kin selection. ResultsThe genome was assembled employing a hybrid approach combining short and long reads, resulting in 241 contigs spanning 259 Mb (N50 of 6.2 Mb and 97.5% complete BUSCOs). Comparative analyses shed light on some evolutionary aspects of stingless bee genomics, including multiple chromosomal rearrangements in Melipona. Additionally, we explored the evolution of venom genes in M. bicolor and other stingless bees, revealing that, apart from two genes, the conserved repertoire of venom components remains under purifying selection in this clade. ConclusionThis study advances our understanding of stingless bee genomics, contributing to the conservation efforts of these vital pollinators and offering insights into the evolutionary mechanisms driving their unique adaptations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor triggers a transcriptional program to control cellular response to stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 controls gene transcription are not completely understood. Here, using a multi-omics integration framework, we uncover the critical role of spatio-temporal genome architecture in this process. We demonstrate that p53 drives direct and indirect changes in genome compartments, topologically associating domains and DNA loops within minutes of its activation, which escort the p53 transcriptional program along time. Focused on p53-bound enhancers, we report a core transcriptional program of 340 genes directly regulated by p53 over distance, most of these not previously identified. Finally, we showcase that p53 controls transcription of distal genes through newly formed and pre-existing enhancer-promoter loops in a cohesin dependent manner. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated architectural role of p53 as regulator at distinct topological layers and provide a reliable set of new p53 direct target genes that may help future designs of p53-based cancer therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic enhancers are key transcriptional regulators which, upon the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors, activate their cognate target promoters. Although enhancers have been extensively studied in isolation, a substantial number of genes have more than one simultaneously active enhancer, and it remains unclear how these cooperate to regulate transcription. Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model, we assay the activities of more than a thousand individual enhancers and a million enhancer pairs towards housekeeping and developmental core promoters with STARR-seq. We report that housekeeping and developmental enhancers show distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity: while housekeeping enhancers are additive such that their combined activity mirrors the sum of their individual activities, developmental enhancers are synergistic and follow a multiplicative model of cooperativity. This developmental enhancer synergy is promiscuous and neither depends on the enhancers&#39; endogenous genomic contexts nor on specific transcription factor motif signatures, but it saturates for the highest levels of enhancer activity. These results have important implications for our understanding of gene-regulation in complex multi-enhancer loci and genomically clustered housekeeping genes, providing a rationale for strong and mild transcriptional effects of mutations within enhancer regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The higher-order structure of newly replicated (i.e.  nascent) chromatin fibers remains poorly-resolved, limiting our understanding of how epigenomes are maintained across cell divisions. To address this, we present Replication-Aware Single-molecule Accessibility Mapping (RASAM), a long-read sequencing method that nondestructively measures genome-wide replication-status and protein-DNA interactions simultaneously on intact chromatin templates. We report that individual human and mouse nascent chromatin fibers are  hyperaccessible compared to steady-state chromatin. This hyperaccessibility occurs at two, coupled length-scales: first, individual nucleosome core particles on nascent DNA exist as a mixture of partially-unwrapped nucleosomes and other subnucleosomal species; second, newly-replicated chromatin fibers are significantly enriched for irregularly-spaced nucleosomes on individual DNA molecules. Focusing on specific cis-regulatory elements (e.g. transcription factor binding sites; active transcription start sites [TSSs]), we discover unique modes by which nascent chromatin hyperaccessibility is resolved at the single-molecule level: at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, CTCF and nascent nucleosomes compete for motifs on nascent chromatin fibers, resulting in quantitatively-reduced CTCF occupancy and motif accessibility post-replication; at active TSSs, high levels of steady-state chromatin accessibility are preserved, implying that nucleosome free regions (NFRs) are rapidly re-established behind the fork. Our study introduces a new paradigm for studying higher-order chromatin fiber organization behind the replication fork. More broadly, we uncover a unique organization of newly replicated chromatin that must be reset by active processes, providing a substrate for epigenetic reprogramming.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDInteractions among cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a crucial role in gene regulation. Various approaches have been developed to map these interactions genome-wide, including those relying on interindividual epigenomic variation to identify groups of covariable regulatory elements, referred to as chromatin modules (CMs). While CM mapping allows to investigate the relationship between chromatin modularity and gene expression, the computational principles used for CM identification vary in their application and outcomes.

RESULTSWe comprehensively evaluate and streamline existing CM mapping tools and present guidelines for optimal utilization of epigenome data from a diverse population of individuals to assess regulatory coordination across the human genome. We showcase the effectiveness of our recommended practices by analysing distinct cell types and demonstrate cell type-specificity of CRE interactions in CMs and their relevance for gene expression. Integration of genotype information revealed that many non-coding disease-associated variants affect the activity of CMs in a cell type-specific manner by affecting the binding of cell type-specific transcription factors. We provide example cases that illustrate in detail how CMs can be used to deconstruct GWAS loci, understand variable expression of cell surface receptors in immune cells and reveal how genetic variation can impact the expression of prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

CONCLUSIONSOur study presents an optimal strategy for CM mapping, and reveals how CMs capture the coordination of CREs and its impact on gene expression. Non-coding genetic variants can disrupt this coordination, and we highlight how this may lead to disease predisposition in a cell type-specific manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been the major approach to understand the biological basis of individual differences in traits and diseases. However, GWAS approaches have proven to have limited predictive power to explain individual differences, particularly for complex traits and diseases in which environmental factors play a substantial role in their etiology. Indeed, individual differences persist even in genetically identical individuals, although fully separating genetic and environmental causation is difficult or impossible in most organisms. To understand the basis of individual differences in the absence of genetic differences, we measured two quantitative reproductive traits in 180 genetically identical young adult Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms in a shared environment and performed single-individual transcriptomics on each worm. We identified hundreds of genes for which expression variation was strongly associated with reproductive traits, some of which depended on prior environmental experience and some of which was random. Multiple small sets of genes together were highly predictive of reproductive traits across individuals, explaining on average over half and over a quarter of variation in the two traits. We manipulated mRNA levels of predictive genes using RNA interference to identify a set of causal genes, demonstrating the utility of this approach for both prediction and understanding underlying biology. Finally, we found that the chromatin environment of predictive genes was enriched for H3K27 trimethylation, suggesting that individual gene expression differences underlying critical traits may be driven in part by chromatin structure. Together, this work shows that individual differences in gene expression that arise independently of underlying genetic differences are both predictive and causal in shaping reproductive traits at levels that equal or exceed genetic variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A global genome database of all of Earths species diversity could be a treasure trove of scientific discoveries. However, regardless of the major advances in genome sequencing technologies, only a tiny fraction of species have genomic information available. To contribute to a more complete planetary genomic database, scientists and institutions across the world have united under the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which plans to sequence and assemble high-quality reference genomes for all [~]1.5 million recognized eukaryotic species through a stepwise phased approach. As the initiative transitions into Phase II, where 150,000 species are to be sequenced in just four years, worldwide participation in the project will be fundamental to success. As the European node of the EBP, the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) seeks to implement a new decentralised, accessible, equitable and inclusive model for producing high-quality reference genomes, which will inform EBP as it scales. To embark on this mission, ERGA launched a Pilot Project to establish a network across Europe to develop and test the first infrastructure of its kind for the coordinated and distributed reference genome production on 98 European eukaryotic species from sample providers across 33 European countries. Here we outline the process and challenges faced during the development of a pilot infrastructure for the production of reference genome resources, and explore the effectiveness of this approach in terms of high-quality reference genome production, considering also equity and inclusion. The outcomes and lessons learned during this pilot provide a solid foundation for ERGA while offering key learnings to other transnational and national genomic resource projects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples. We present genome-wide ancient DNA data for 181 individuals from this region spanning the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age. We find that Early to Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherer populations from across the southern forest and forest-steppes of Northern Eurasia can be characterized by a continuous gradient of ancestry that remained stable for millennia, ranging from fully West Eurasian in the Baltic region to fully East Asian in the Transbaikal region. In contrast, cotemporaneous groups in far Northeast Siberia were genetically distinct, retaining high levels of continuity from a population that was the primary source of ancestry for Native Americans. By the mid-Holocene, admixture between this early Northeastern Siberian population and groups from Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin produced two distinctive populations in eastern Siberia that played an important role in the genetic formation of later people. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic-Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is found substantially only among Yeniseian-speaking groups and those known to have admixed with them. Ancestry from the second, Yakutian Late Neolithic-Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is strongly associated with present-day Uralic speakers. We show how Yakutia_LNBA ancestry spread from an east Siberian origin [~]4.5kya, along with subclades of Y-chromosome haplogroup N occurring at high frequencies among present-day Uralic speakers, into Western and Central Siberia in communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy: a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that spread explosively across an enormous region of Northern Eurasia [~]4.0kya. However, the ancestry of the 16 Seima-Turbino-period individuals--the first reported from sites with this metallurgy--was otherwise extraordinarily diverse, with partial descent from Indo-Iranian-speaking pastoralists and multiple hunter-gatherer populations from widely separated regions of Eurasia. Our results provide support for theories suggesting that early Uralic speakers at the beginning of their westward dispersal where involved in the expansion of Seima-Turbino metallurgical traditions, and suggests that both cultural transmission and migration were important in the spread of Seima-Turbino material culture.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Salmonid species have followed markedly divergent evolutionary trajectories in their interactions with sea lice. While sea lice parasitism poses significant economic, environmental, and animal welfare challenges for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exhibit near-complete resistance to sea lice, achieved through a potent epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid louse detachment. The molecular mechanisms underlying these divergent responses to sea lice are unknown. Results: We characterised the cellular and molecular responses of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon to sea lice using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Juvenile fish were exposed to copepodid sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), and lice-attached pelvic fin and skin samples were collected 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, and 60h after exposure, along with control samples. Comparative analysis of control and treatment samples revealed an immune and wound-healing response that was common to both species, but attenuated in Atlantic salmon, potentially reflecting greater sea louse immunomodulation. Our results revealed unique but complementary roles of three layers of keratinocytes in the epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid sea lice rejection in coho salmon. Our results suggest that basal keratinocytes direct the expansion and mobility of intermediate and, especially, superficial keratinocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasite. Conclusion: Our results highlight the key role of keratinocytes to coho salmon&#39;s sea lice resistance, and the diverged biological response of the two salmonid host species when interacting with this parasite. This study has identified key pathways and candidate genes that could be manipulated using various biotechnological solutions to improve Atlantic salmon sea lice resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses continue to pose global risks to One Health, including agriculture, public, and animal health. Rapid and accurate genomic surveillance is critical for monitoring viral mutations, tracing transmission, and guiding interventions in near real-time. Oxford Nanopore sequencing holds promise for real-time influenza genotyping, but data quality from R9 chemistry has limited its adoption due to challenges resolving low-complexity regions such as the biologically critical hemagglutinin cleavage site, a homopolymer of basic amino acids that distinguish highly pathogenic strains. In this study, human and avian influenza isolates (n=45) from Cambodia were sequenced using both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 flow cells and chemistries to evaluate performance between approaches. Overall, R10.4.1 yielded increased data output with higher average quality compared to R9.4.1, producing improved consensus sequences using a reference-based bioinformatics approach. R10.4.1 had significantly lower minor population insertion and deletion frequencies, driven by improved performance in low sequence complexity regions prone to insertion and deletion errors, such as homopolymers. Within the hemagglutinin cleavage site, R10.4.1 resolved the correct motif in 90% of genomes compared to only 60% with R9.4.1. Further examination showed reduced frameshift mutations in consensus sequences generated with R10.4.1 that could result in incorrectly classified virulence. Improved consensus genome quality from nanopore sequencing approaches, especially across biologically important low-complexity regions, is critical to reduce subjective hand-curation and will improve local and global genomic surveillance responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe highly eusocial stingless bees are crucial pollinators of native and agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, genomic studies within this bee tribe remain scarce. We present the genome assembly of the stingless bee Melipona bicolor. This bee is a remarkable exception to the typical single-queen colony structure, since in this species, multiple queens may coexist and share reproductive duties, resulting in genetically diverse colonies with weak kinship connections. As the only known genuinely polygynous bee, M. bicolors genome provides a valuable resource for investigating sociality beyond kin selection.

ResultsThe genome was assembled employing a hybrid approach combining short and long reads, resulting in 241 contigs spanning 259 Mb (N50 of 6.2 Mb and 97.5% complete BUSCOs). Comparative analyses shed light on some evolutionary aspects of stingless bee genomics, including multiple chromosomal rearrangements in Melipona. Additionally, we explored the evolution of venom genes in M. bicolor and other stingless bees, revealing that, apart from two genes, the conserved repertoire of venom components remains under purifying selection in this clade.

ConclusionThis study advances our understanding of stingless bee genomics, contributing to the conservation efforts of these vital pollinators and offering insights into the evolutionary mechanisms driving their unique adaptations.</p>
