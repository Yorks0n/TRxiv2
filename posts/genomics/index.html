A.; Zhu, H.; Dennis, T.; Mohda, S.; Lytras, S.; Hughes, J. J.; Gatseva, A.; Gifford, R. J.\nScore: 30.3, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562709\nBackgroundGenomic regions that remain poorly understood, often referred to as the \"dark genome,\" contain a variety of functionally relevant and biologically informative genome features. These include endogenous viral elements (EVEs) - virus-derived sequences that can dramatically impact host biology and serve as a virus \"fossil record\". In this study, we introduce a database-integrated genome screening (DIGS) approach to investigating the dark genome in silico, focusing on EVEs found within vertebrate genomes. ResultsUsing DIGS on 874 vertebrate species genomes, we uncovered approximately 1.1 million EVE sequences, with over 99% originating from endogenous retroviruses or transposable elements that contain EVE DNA. We show that the remaining 6038 sequences represent over a thousand distinct horizontal gene transfer events across ten virus families, including some that have not previously been reported as EVEs. We explore the genomic and phylogenetic characteristics of non-retroviral EVEs and determine their rates of acquisition during vertebrate evolution. Our study uncovers novel virus diversity and broadens our knowledge of virus distribution among vertebrate hosts. It also provides new insights into the long-term evolution of highly pathogenic filoviruses. ConclusionsWe comprehensively catalogue and analyse EVEs within 874 vertebrate genomes, shedding light on the distribution, diversity and long-term evolution of viruses, and revealing their extensive impact on vertebrate genome evolution. Our results demonstrate the power of linking a relational database management system to a similarity search-based screening pipeline for in silico exploration of the dark genome.\nA Deep Dive into Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Foundation Models\nAuthors: Boiarsky, R.; Singh, N. M.; Buendia, A.; Getz, G.; Sontag, D.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563100\nLarge-scale foundation models, which are pre-trained on massive, unlabeled datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on specific tasks, have recently achieved unparalleled success on a wide array of applications, including in healthcare and biology. In this paper, we explore two foundation models recently developed for single-cell RNA sequencing data, scBERT and scGPT. Focusing on the fine-tuning task of cell type annotation, we explore the relative performance of pre-trained models compared to a simple baseline, L1-regularized logistic regression, including in the few-shot setting. We perform ablation studies to understand whether pretraining improves model performance and to better understand the difficulty of the pre-training task in scBERT. Finally, using scBERT as an example, we demonstrate the potential sensitivity of fine-tuning to hyperparameter settings and parameter initializations. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of rigorously testing foundation models against well established baselines, establishing challenging fine-tuning tasks on which to benchmark foundation models, and performing deep introspection into the embeddings learned by the model in order to more effectively harness these models to transform single-cell data analysis.

L.; Roberts, N.; Kassouf, M.; Riva, S. G.; Sanders, E. L.; Francis, H. S.; Blayney, J.; Oudelaar, M.; Milne, T. A.; Higgs, D.; Hughes, J. R.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562171\nAs the structure of the genome is analysed at ever increasing resolution it is becoming clear that there is considerable variation in the 3D chromatin architecture across different cell types. It has been proposed that this may, in part, be due to increased recruitment of cohesin to activated cis-elements (enhancers and promoters) leading to cell-type specific loop extrusion underlying the formation of new subTADs. Here we show that cohesin correlates well with the presence of active enhancers and this varies in an allele-specific manner with the presence or absence of polymorphic enhancers which vary from one individual to another. Using the alpha globin cluster as a model, we show that when all enhancers are removed, peaks of cohesin disappear from these regions and the erythroid specific subTAD is no longer formed. Re-insertion of the major alpha globin enhancer (R2) is associated with the appearance of a new peak of cohesin at the site of insertion. In complementary experiments insertion of R2 into a \"neutral\" region of the genome recruits cohesin, induces transcription and creates a new large (75kb) erythroid specific domain. Together these findings support the proposal that active enhancers recruit cohesin, stimulate loop extrusion and promote the formation of cell specific subTADs.\nQuantification of the escape from X chromosome inactivation with the million cell-scale human single-cell omics datasets reveals heterogeneity of escape across cell types and tissues\nAuthors: Tomofuji, Y.; Edahiro, R.; Shirai, Y.; Kock, K.

W.; Prabhakar, S.; Kumanogoh, A.; Okada, Y.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.561800\nOne of the two X chromosomes of females is silenced through X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to compensate for the difference in the dosage between sexes. Among the X-linked genes, several genes escape from XCI, which could contribute to the differential gene expression between the sexes. However, the differences in the escape across cell types and tissues are still poorly characterized because no methods could directly evaluate the escape under a physiological condition at the cell-cluster resolution with versatile technology. Here, we developed a method, single-cell Level inactivated X chromosome mapping (scLinaX), which directly quantifies relative gene expression from the inactivated X chromosome with droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The scLinaX and differentially expressed genes analyses with the scRNA-seq datasets of [~]1,000,000 blood cells consistently identified the relatively strong degree of escape in lymphocytes compared to myeloid cells. An extension of scLinaX for multi-modal datasets, scLinaX-multi, suggested a stronger degree of escape in lymphocytes than myeloid cells at the chromatin-accessibility level with a 10X multiome dataset. The scLinaX analysis with the human multiple-organ scRNA-seq datasets also identified the relatively strong degree of escape from XCI in lymphoid tissues and lymphocytes. Finally, effect size comparisons of genome-wide association studies between sexes identified the larger effect sizes of the PRKX gene locus-lymphocyte counts association in females than males. This could suggest evidence of the underlying impact of escape on the genotype-phenotype association in humans. Overall, scLinaX and the quantified catalog of escape identified the heterogeneity of escape across cell types and tissues and would contribute to expanding the current understanding of the XCI, escape, and sex differences in gene regulation.\nKeratinocytes Drive the Epithelial Hyperplasia Key to Sea Lice Resistance in Coho Salmon\nAuthors: Salisbury, S. J.; Ruiz Daniels, R.; Monaghan, S. J.; Bron, J. E.; Villamayor, P. R.; Gervais, O.; Fast, M. D.; Sveen, L.; Houston, R. D.; Robinson, N.; Robledo, D.\nScore: 12.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562030\nBackgroundSalmonid species have followed markedly divergent evolutionary trajectories in their interactions with sea lice. While sea lice parasitism poses significant economic, environmental, and animal welfare challenges for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exhibit near-complete resistance to sea lice, achieved through a potent epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid louse detachment. The molecular mechanisms underlying these divergent responses to sea lice are unknown. ResultsWe characterised the cellular and molecular responses of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon to sea lice using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Juvenile fish were exposed to copepodid sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), and lice-attached pelvic fin and skin samples were collected 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, and 60h after exposure, along with control samples. Comparative analysis of control and treatment samples revealed an immune and wound-healing response that was common to both species, but attenuated in Atlantic salmon, potentially reflecting greater sea louse immunomodulation. Our results revealed unique but complementary roles of three layers of keratinocytes in the epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid sea lice rejection in coho salmon. Our results suggest that basal keratinocytes direct the expansion and mobility of intermediate and, especially, superficial keratinocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasite. ConclusionOur results highlight the key role of keratinocytes to coho salmons sea lice resistance, and the diverged biological response of the two salmonid host species when interacting with this parasite. This study has identified key pathways and candidate genes that could be manipulated using various biotechnological solutions to improve Atlantic salmon sea lice resistance.\nEpigenome erosion in Alzheimer's disease brain cells and induced neurons\nAuthors: Wang, B.; Jones, J.; Zhou, J.; Tian, W.; Wu, Y.; Wang, W.; Berube, P.; Bartlett, A.; Castanon, R. G.; Nery, J. R.; Chen, H.; Kenworthy, M.; Altshul, J.; Valadon, C.; Wang, Y.; Kang, A.; Goodman, R.; Liem, M.; Claffey, N.; O'Connor, C.; Metcalf, J.; Luo, C.; Gage, F. H.; Ecker, J. R.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562394\nLate-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) is typically sporadic, correlated only to advanced age, and has no clear genetic risk factors. The sporadic nature of LOAD presents a challenge to understanding its pathogenesis and mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively investigated the epigenome of LOAD primary entorhinal cortex brain tissues via single-cell multi-omics technologies, simultaneously capturing DNA methylation and 3D chromatin conformation. We identified AD-specific DNA methylation signatures and found they interact with bivalent promoters of AD differentially expressed genes. In addition, we discovered global chromosomal epigenome erosion of 3D genome structure within and across brain cell types. Furthermore, to evaluate whether these age- and disease-dependent molecular signatures could be detected in the in vitro cellular models, we derived induced neurons (iNs) converted directly from AD patients fibroblasts and found a set of conserved methylation signatures and shared molecular processes. We developed a machine-learning algorithm to identify robust and consistent methylation signatures of LOAD in vivo primary brain tissues and in vitro fibroblast-derived iNs. The results recapitulate the age- and disease-related epigenetic features in iNs and highlight the power of epigenome and chromatin conformation for identifying molecular mechanisms of neuronal aging and generating biomarkers for LOAD. HIGHLIGHTO_LIAD-specific DNA methylation signatures are identified in entorhinal cortex brain cell types C_LIO_LIThe AD differentially expressed genes linked with differentially methylated regions via loop interactions are enriched in a bivalent chromatin state C_LIO_LIChromosomal epigenome erosion of 3D genome structures occurs in LOAD brain cell types.

M.; Goel, V.; Blanchette, M.; Bhakta, M. S.; Hansen, A. S.; Joung, J. K.; Johnstone, S.; Eyler, C. E.; Aryee, M. J.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563340\nDNA looping is vital for establishing many enhancer-promoter interactions. While CTCF is known to anchor many cohesin-mediated loops, the looped chromatin fiber appears to predominantly exist in a poorly characterized actively extruding state. To better characterize extruding chromatin loop structures, we used CTCF MNase HiChIP data to determine both CTCF binding at high resolution and 3D contact information. Here we present FactorFinder, a tool that identifies CTCF binding sites at near base-pair resolution. We leverage this substantial advance in resolution to determine that the fully extruded (CTCF-CTCF) state is rare genome-wide with locus-specific variation from ~1-10%. We further investigate the impact of chromatin state on loop extrusion dynamics, and find that active enhancers and RNA Pol II impede cohesin extrusion, facilitating an enrichment of enhancer-promoter contacts in the partially extruded loop state. We propose a model of topological regulation whereby the transient, partially extruded states play active roles in transcription.\nMaximizing Efficiency in SedaDNA Analysis: A Novel Extract Pooling Approach\nAuthors: Oberreiter, V.; Gelabert, P.; Brueck, F.; Franz, S.; Zelger, E.; Szedlacsek, S.; Cheronet, O.; Tenorio Cano, F.; Exler, F.; Zagorc, B.; Karavanic, I.; Banda, M.; Gasparyan, B.; Straus, L. G.; Gonzalez Morales, M. R.; Kappelman, J.; Stahlschmidt, M.; Rattei, T.; Kraemer, S. M.; Sawyer, S.; Pinhasi, R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562718\nIn recent years, the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) has taken a new direction toward studying human population dynamics through sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA), enabling the study of past ecosystems. However, the screening of numerous sediment samples from archaeological sites remains a time-consuming and costly endeavor, particularly when targeting hominin DNA. Here, we present a novel high-throughput method that facilitates the fast and efficient analysis of sediment samples by applying a pooled testing method. Our approach involves combining multiple extracts, allowing users to parallelize laboratory procedures early in the sample preparation pipeline while effectively screening for the presence of aDNA. Pooled samples that exhibit aDNA signals can then undergo detailed analysis, while empty pools are discarded. We have successfully applied our extract pooling method to various sediment samples from Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Notably, our results reveal that an aDNA signal remains discernible even when pooled with four negative samples. We also demonstrate that the DNA yield of double-stranded libraries increases significantly when reducing the extract input, potentially mitigating the effects of inhibition. By embracing this innovative approach, researchers can analyze large numbers of sediment samples for aDNA preservation, achieving significant cost reductions of up to 70% and reducing hands-on laboratory time to one-fifth.\nChromosomal DNA sequences of the Pacific saury genome: versatile resources for fishery science and comparative biology\nAuthors: Sato, M.; Fukuda, K.; Kadota, M.; Makino-Itou, H.; Tatsumi, K.; Yamauchi, S.; Kuraku, S.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562003\nPacific saury (Cololabis saira) is a commercially important small pelagic fish species in Asian. In this study, we conducted the first-ever whole genome sequencing of this species, with single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. The obtained high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequence data, which amount to approximately 30 folds of its haploid genome size that was measured with quantitative PCR (1.17 Gb), were assembled into contigs. Scaffolding with Hi-C reads yielded a whole genome assembly containing 24 chromosome-scale sequences, with a scaffold N50 length of 47.7 Mb. Screening of repetitive elements including telomeric repeats was performed to characterize possible factors that need to be resolved towards telomere-to-telomere sequencing. The larger genome size than in medaka, a close relative in Beloniformes, is at least partly explained by larger repetitive element quantity, which is reflected in more abundant tRNAs, in the Pacific saury genome. Protein-coding regions was predicted using transcriptome data, which resulted in 22,274 components. Retrieval of Pacific saury homologs of aquaporin (AQP) genes known from other teleost fishes validated high completeness and continuity of the genome assembly. These resources are available at https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/saira/ and will assist various molecular-level studies in fishery science and comparative biology.\nExploring polymorphic interspecies structural variants in Eucalyptus: Unravelling Their Role in Reproductive Isolation and Adaptive Divergence.\nAuthors: Ferguson, S.; Jones, A.; Murray, K. D.; Andrew, R. L.; Bothwell, H.; Schwessinger, B.; Borevitz, J. O.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563207\nStructural variants (SVs) play a significant role in speciation and adaptation in many species, yet few studies have explored the prevalence and impact of different categories of SVs. We conducted a comparative analysis of long-read assembled reference genomes of closely related Eucalyptus species to identify candidate SVs potentially influencing speciation and adaptation. Interspecies SVs can be either fixed differences, or polymorphic in one or both species. To describe SV patterns, we employed short-read whole-genome sequencing on over 600 individuals of E. melliodora and E. sideroxylon, along with recent high quality genome assemblies. We aligned reads and genotyped interspecies SVs predicted between species reference genomes. Our results revealed that 49,756 of 58,025 and 39,536 of 47,064 interspecies SVs could be typed with short reads, in E. melliodora and E. sideroxylon respectively. Focusing on inversions and translocations, symmetric SVs which are readily genotyped within both populations, 24 were found to be structural divergences, 2,623 structural polymorphisms, and 928 shared structural polymorphisms. We assessed the functional significance of fixed interspecies SVs by examining differences in estimated recombination rates and genetic differentiation between species, revealing a complex history of natural selection. Shared structural polymorphisms displayed enrichment of potentially adaptive genes. Understanding how different classes of genetic mutations contribute to genetic diversity and reproductive barriers is essential for understanding how organisms enhance fitness, adapt to changing environments, and diversify. Our findings reveal the prevalence of interspecies SVs and elucidate their role in genetic differentiation, adaptive evolution, and species divergence within and between populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGenomic regions that remain poorly understood, often referred to as the &#34;dark genome,&#34; contain a variety of functionally relevant and biologically informative genome features. These include endogenous viral elements (EVEs) - virus-derived sequences that can dramatically impact host biology and serve as a virus &#34;fossil record&#34;. In this study, we introduce a database-integrated genome screening (DIGS) approach to investigating the dark genome in silico, focusing on EVEs found within vertebrate genomes.

ResultsUsing DIGS on 874 vertebrate species genomes, we uncovered approximately 1.1 million EVE sequences, with over 99% originating from endogenous retroviruses or transposable elements that contain EVE DNA. We show that the remaining 6038 sequences represent over a thousand distinct horizontal gene transfer events across ten virus families, including some that have not previously been reported as EVEs. We explore the genomic and phylogenetic characteristics of non-retroviral EVEs and determine their rates of acquisition during vertebrate evolution. Our study uncovers novel virus diversity and broadens our knowledge of virus distribution among vertebrate hosts. It also provides new insights into the long-term evolution of highly pathogenic filoviruses.

ConclusionsWe comprehensively catalogue and analyse EVEs within 874 vertebrate genomes, shedding light on the distribution, diversity and long-term evolution of viruses, and revealing their extensive impact on vertebrate genome evolution. Our results demonstrate the power of linking a relational database management system to a similarity search-based screening pipeline for in silico exploration of the dark genome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large-scale foundation models, which are pre-trained on massive, unlabeled datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on specific tasks, have recently achieved unparalleled success on a wide array of applications, including in healthcare and biology. In this paper, we explore two foundation models recently developed for single-cell RNA sequencing data, scBERT and scGPT. Focusing on the fine-tuning task of cell type annotation, we explore the relative performance of pre-trained models compared to a simple baseline, L1-regularized logistic regression, including in the few-shot setting. We perform ablation studies to understand whether pretraining improves model performance and to better understand the difficulty of the pre-training task in scBERT. Finally, using scBERT as an example, we demonstrate the potential sensitivity of fine-tuning to hyperparameter settings and parameter initializations. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of rigorously testing foundation models against well established baselines, establishing challenging fine-tuning tasks on which to benchmark foundation models, and performing deep introspection into the embeddings learned by the model in order to more effectively harness these models to transform single-cell data analysis.

        <p class="abstract">As the structure of the genome is analysed at ever increasing resolution it is becoming clear that there is considerable variation in the 3D chromatin architecture across different cell types. It has been proposed that this may, in part, be due to increased recruitment of cohesin to activated cis-elements (enhancers and promoters) leading to cell-type specific loop extrusion underlying the formation of new subTADs. Here we show that cohesin correlates well with the presence of active enhancers and this varies in an allele-specific manner with the presence or absence of polymorphic enhancers which vary from one individual to another. Using the alpha globin cluster as a model, we show that when all enhancers are removed, peaks of cohesin disappear from these regions and the erythroid specific subTAD is no longer formed. Re-insertion of the major alpha globin enhancer (R2) is associated with the appearance of a new peak of cohesin at the site of insertion. In complementary experiments insertion of R2 into a &#34;neutral&#34; region of the genome recruits cohesin, induces transcription and creates a new large (75kb) erythroid specific domain. Together these findings support the proposal that active enhancers recruit cohesin, stimulate loop extrusion and promote the formation of cell specific subTADs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the two X chromosomes of females is silenced through X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to compensate for the difference in the dosage between sexes. Among the X-linked genes, several genes escape from XCI, which could contribute to the differential gene expression between the sexes. However, the differences in the escape across cell types and tissues are still poorly characterized because no methods could directly evaluate the escape under a physiological condition at the cell-cluster resolution with versatile technology. Here, we developed a method, single-cell Level inactivated X chromosome mapping (scLinaX), which directly quantifies relative gene expression from the inactivated X chromosome with droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The scLinaX and differentially expressed genes analyses with the scRNA-seq datasets of [~]1,000,000 blood cells consistently identified the relatively strong degree of escape in lymphocytes compared to myeloid cells. An extension of scLinaX for multi-modal datasets, scLinaX-multi, suggested a stronger degree of escape in lymphocytes than myeloid cells at the chromatin-accessibility level with a 10X multiome dataset. The scLinaX analysis with the human multiple-organ scRNA-seq datasets also identified the relatively strong degree of escape from XCI in lymphoid tissues and lymphocytes. Finally, effect size comparisons of genome-wide association studies between sexes identified the larger effect sizes of the PRKX gene locus-lymphocyte counts association in females than males. This could suggest evidence of the underlying impact of escape on the genotype-phenotype association in humans. Overall, scLinaX and the quantified catalog of escape identified the heterogeneity of escape across cell types and tissues and would contribute to expanding the current understanding of the XCI, escape, and sex differences in gene regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSalmonid species have followed markedly divergent evolutionary trajectories in their interactions with sea lice. While sea lice parasitism poses significant economic, environmental, and animal welfare challenges for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exhibit near-complete resistance to sea lice, achieved through a potent epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid louse detachment. The molecular mechanisms underlying these divergent responses to sea lice are unknown.

ResultsWe characterised the cellular and molecular responses of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon to sea lice using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Juvenile fish were exposed to copepodid sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), and lice-attached pelvic fin and skin samples were collected 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, and 60h after exposure, along with control samples. Comparative analysis of control and treatment samples revealed an immune and wound-healing response that was common to both species, but attenuated in Atlantic salmon, potentially reflecting greater sea louse immunomodulation. Our results revealed unique but complementary roles of three layers of keratinocytes in the epithelial hyperplasia response leading to rapid sea lice rejection in coho salmon. Our results suggest that basal keratinocytes direct the expansion and mobility of intermediate and, especially, superficial keratinocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasite.

ConclusionOur results highlight the key role of keratinocytes to coho salmons sea lice resistance, and the diverged biological response of the two salmonid host species when interacting with this parasite. This study has identified key pathways and candidate genes that could be manipulated using various biotechnological solutions to improve Atlantic salmon sea lice resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) is typically sporadic, correlated only to advanced age, and has no clear genetic risk factors. The sporadic nature of LOAD presents a challenge to understanding its pathogenesis and mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively investigated the epigenome of LOAD primary entorhinal cortex brain tissues via single-cell multi-omics technologies, simultaneously capturing DNA methylation and 3D chromatin conformation. We identified AD-specific DNA methylation signatures and found they interact with bivalent promoters of AD differentially expressed genes. In addition, we discovered global chromosomal epigenome erosion of 3D genome structure within and across brain cell types. Furthermore, to evaluate whether these age- and disease-dependent molecular signatures could be detected in the in vitro cellular models, we derived induced neurons (iNs) converted directly from AD patients fibroblasts and found a set of conserved methylation signatures and shared molecular processes. We developed a machine-learning algorithm to identify robust and consistent methylation signatures of LOAD in vivo primary brain tissues and in vitro fibroblast-derived iNs. The results recapitulate the age- and disease-related epigenetic features in iNs and highlight the power of epigenome and chromatin conformation for identifying molecular mechanisms of neuronal aging and generating biomarkers for LOAD.

        <p class="abstract">DNA looping is vital for establishing many enhancer-promoter interactions. While CTCF is known to anchor many cohesin-mediated loops, the looped chromatin fiber appears to predominantly exist in a poorly characterized actively extruding state. To better characterize extruding chromatin loop structures, we used CTCF MNase HiChIP data to determine both CTCF binding at high resolution and 3D contact information. Here we present FactorFinder, a tool that identifies CTCF binding sites at near base-pair resolution. We leverage this substantial advance in resolution to determine that the fully extruded (CTCF-CTCF) state is rare genome-wide with locus-specific variation from ~1-10%. We further investigate the impact of chromatin state on loop extrusion dynamics, and find that active enhancers and RNA Pol II impede cohesin extrusion, facilitating an enrichment of enhancer-promoter contacts in the partially extruded loop state. We propose a model of topological regulation whereby the transient, partially extruded states play active roles in transcription.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) has taken a new direction toward studying human population dynamics through sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA), enabling the study of past ecosystems. However, the screening of numerous sediment samples from archaeological sites remains a time-consuming and costly endeavor, particularly when targeting hominin DNA. Here, we present a novel high-throughput method that facilitates the fast and efficient analysis of sediment samples by applying a pooled testing method. Our approach involves combining multiple extracts, allowing users to parallelize laboratory procedures early in the sample preparation pipeline while effectively screening for the presence of aDNA. Pooled samples that exhibit aDNA signals can then undergo detailed analysis, while empty pools are discarded. We have successfully applied our extract pooling method to various sediment samples from Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Notably, our results reveal that an aDNA signal remains discernible even when pooled with four negative samples. We also demonstrate that the DNA yield of double-stranded libraries increases significantly when reducing the extract input, potentially mitigating the effects of inhibition. By embracing this innovative approach, researchers can analyze large numbers of sediment samples for aDNA preservation, achieving significant cost reductions of up to 70% and reducing hands-on laboratory time to one-fifth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) is a commercially important small pelagic fish species in Asian. In this study, we conducted the first-ever whole genome sequencing of this species, with single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. The obtained high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequence data, which amount to approximately 30 folds of its haploid genome size that was measured with quantitative PCR (1.17 Gb), were assembled into contigs. Scaffolding with Hi-C reads yielded a whole genome assembly containing 24 chromosome-scale sequences, with a scaffold N50 length of 47.7 Mb. Screening of repetitive elements including telomeric repeats was performed to characterize possible factors that need to be resolved towards  telomere-to-telomere sequencing. The larger genome size than in medaka, a close relative in Beloniformes, is at least partly explained by larger repetitive element quantity, which is reflected in more abundant tRNAs, in the Pacific saury genome. Protein-coding regions was predicted using transcriptome data, which resulted in 22,274 components. Retrieval of Pacific saury homologs of aquaporin (AQP) genes known from other teleost fishes validated high completeness and continuity of the genome assembly. These resources are available at https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/saira/ and will assist various molecular-level studies in fishery science and comparative biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural variants (SVs) play a significant role in speciation and adaptation in many species, yet few studies have explored the prevalence and impact of different categories of SVs. We conducted a comparative analysis of long-read assembled reference genomes of closely related Eucalyptus species to identify candidate SVs potentially influencing speciation and adaptation. Interspecies SVs can be either fixed differences, or polymorphic in one or both species. To describe SV patterns, we employed short-read whole-genome sequencing on over 600 individuals of E. melliodora and E. sideroxylon, along with recent high quality genome assemblies. We aligned reads and genotyped interspecies SVs predicted between species reference genomes. Our results revealed that 49,756 of 58,025 and 39,536 of 47,064 interspecies SVs could be typed with short reads, in E. melliodora and E. sideroxylon respectively. Focusing on inversions and translocations, symmetric SVs which are readily genotyped within both populations, 24 were found to be structural divergences, 2,623 structural polymorphisms, and 928 shared structural polymorphisms. We assessed the functional significance of fixed interspecies SVs by examining differences in estimated recombination rates and genetic differentiation between species, revealing a complex history of natural selection. Shared structural polymorphisms displayed enrichment of potentially adaptive genes. Understanding how different classes of genetic mutations contribute to genetic diversity and reproductive barriers is essential for understanding how organisms enhance fitness, adapt to changing environments, and diversify. Our findings reveal the prevalence of interspecies SVs and elucidate their role in genetic differentiation, adaptive evolution, and species divergence within and between populations.</p>
