E.; Maste\nScore: 36.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569198\nApes possess two sex chromosomes--the male-specific Y and the X shared by males and females. The Y chromosome is crucial for male reproduction, with deletions linked to infertility. The X chromosome carries genes vital for reproduction and cognition. Variation in mating patterns and brain function among great apes suggests corresponding differences in their sex chromosome structure and evolution. However, due to their highly repetitive nature and incomplete reference assemblies, ape sex chromosomes have been challenging to study. Here, using the state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods developed for the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human genome, we produced gapless, complete assemblies of the X and Y chromosomes for five great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans) and a lesser ape, the siamang gibbon. These assemblies completely resolved ampliconic, palindromic, and satellite sequences, including the entire centromeres, allowing us to untangle the intricacies of ape sex chromosome evolution. We found that, compared to the X, ape Y chromosomes vary greatly in size and have low alignability and high levels of structural rearrangements. This divergence on the Y arises from the accumulation of lineage-specific ampliconic regions and palindromes (which are shared more broadly among species on the X) and from the abundance of transposable elements and satellites (which have a lower representation on the X). Our analysis of Y chromosome genes revealed lineage-specific expansions of multi-copy gene families and signatures of purifying selection. In summary, the Y exhibits dynamic evolution, while the X is more stable. Finally, mapping short-read sequencing data from \u003e100 great ape individuals revealed the patterns of diversity and selection on their sex chromosomes, demonstrating the utility of these reference assemblies for studies of great ape evolution. These complete sex chromosome assemblies are expected to further inform conservation genetics of nonhuman apes, all of which are endangered species.\nSystematic comparison of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic methods\nAuthors: You, Y.; Fu, Y.; Li, L.; Zhang, Z.; Jia, S.; Lu, S.; Ren, W.; Liu, Y.; Xu, Y.; Liu, X.; Jiang, F.; Peng, G.; Kumar, A. S.; Ritchie, M. E.; Liu, X.; Tian, L.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569744\nRecent advancements of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (sST) have catalyzed significant advancements by facilitating transcriptome-scale spatial gene expression measurement. Despite this progress, efforts to comprehensively benchmark different platforms are currently lacking. The extant variability across technologies and datasets poses challenges in formulating standardized evaluation metrics. In this study, we established a collection of reference tissues and regions characterized by well-defined histological architectures, and used them to generate data to compare six sST methods. We highlighted molecular diffusion as a variable parameter across different methods and tissues, significantly impacting the effective resolutions. Furthermore, we observed that spatial transcriptomic data demonstrate unique attributes beyond merely adding a spatial axis to single-cell data, including an enhanced ability to capture patterned rare cell states along with specific markers, albeit being influenced by multiple factors including sequencing depth and resolution. Our study assists biologists in sST platform selection, and helps foster a consensus on evaluation standards and establish a framework for future benchmarking efforts that can be used as a gold standard for the development and benchmarking of computational tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis.\nStrain-specific evolution and host-specific regulation of transposable elements in the model plant symbiont Rhizophagus irregularis\nAuthors: Oliveira, J. I. N.; Corradi, N.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569630\nTransposable elements (TE) are repetitive DNA that can create variability in genome structure and regulation. The genome of Rhizophagus irregularis, a widely studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), comprises approximately 50% repetitive sequences that include transposable elements (TE). Despite their abundance, two-thirds of TE remain unclassified, and their regulation among AMF life-stages remains unknown. Here, we aimed to improve our understanding of TE diversity and regulation in this model species by curating repeat datasets obtained from chromosome-level assemblies and by investigating their expression across multiple conditions. Our analyses uncovered new TE superfamilies and families in this model symbiont and revealed significant differences in how these sequences evolve both within and between R. irregularis genomes. With this curated TE annotation, we detected that the number of upregulated TE families in colonized roots is four times higher than extraradical mycelium, and their overall expression differs depending on their host. This work provides a fine-scale view of TE diversity and evolution in model plant symbionts and highlights their transcriptional dynamism and specificity during host-microbe interactions. We also provide Hidden Markov Model profiles of TE domains are now available for future manual curation of uncharacterized sequences (https://github.com/jordana-olive/TE-manual-curation/tree/main).\nExtensive remodelling of XIST regulatory networks during primate evolution\nAuthors: Cazottes, E.; Alfeghaly, C.; Rognard, C.; Loda, A.; Castel, G.; Villacorta, L.; Dong, M.; Heard, E.; Aksoy, I.; Savatier, P.; Morey, C.; Rougeulle, C.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569904\nUnravelling how gene regulatory networks are remodelled during evolution is crucial to understand how species adapt to environmental changes. We addressed this question for X-chromosome inactivation, a process essential to female development that is governed, in eutherians, by the XIST lncRNA and its cis-regulators. To reach high resolution, we studied closely related primate species, spanning 55 million years of evolution. We show that the XIST regulatory circuitry has diversified extensively over such evolutionary timeframe. The insertion of a HERVK transposon has reshuffled XIST 3D interaction network in macaque embryonic stem cells (ESC) and XIST expression is maintained by the additive effects of the JPX lncRNA gene and a macaque specific enhancer. In contrast, JPX is the main contributor to XIST expression in human ESCs but is not significantly involved in XIST regulation in marmoset ESCs. None of these entities are however under purifying selection, which suggests that neutrally evolving non-coding elements harbour high adaptive potentials.\nDevelopment of a Next Generation SNP Genotyping Array for Wheat\nAuthors: Burridge, A. J.; Winfield, M.; Przewieslik-Allen, A.; Edwards, K. J.; Siddique, I.; Barral-Arca, R.; Griffiths, S.; Cheng, S.; Huang, Z.; Feng, C.; Dreisigacker, S.; Bentley, A.; Brown-Guedira, G.; Barker, G.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568448\nHigh throughput genotyping arrays have provided a cost effective, reliable and interoperable system for genotyping hexaploid wheat and its related germplasm pool. Existing, highly cited arrays including our 35K Axiom Wheat Breeders genotyping array and the Illumina 90K iSelect array were designed based on a limited amount of varietal sequence diversity and with imperfect knowledge of SNP positions. Recent progress in sequencing wheat varieties and landraces has given us access to a vast pool of SNP diversity, whilst technological improvements in array design has allowed us to fit significantly more probes onto a 384-well format Axiom array than was previously possible. Here we describe a novel High Density Axiom genotyping array, the Triticum aestivum Next Generation array (TaNG), largely derived from whole genome skim sequencing of 204 elite wheat lines and 111 wheat landraces taken from the Watkins \"Core Collection\". We use a novel \"minimal marker\" optimisation approach to select up to six SNPs in each 1.5 MB region of the wheat genome with the highest combined varietal discrimination potential. A design iteration step allowed us to test and replace skim-sequence derived SNPs which failed to convert to reliable Axiom markers, resulting in a final design, designated TaNG1.1 with 43,372 SNPs derived from a haplotype-optimised combination of novel SNPs, DArTAG-derived and legacy wheat Axiom markers. We show that this design has an even distribution of SNPs across chromosomes and sub-genomes compared to previous arrays and can be used to generate genetic maps with a significantly higher number of distinct bins than our previous Axiom array. We also demonstrate the improved performance of TaNG1.1 for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and its utility for Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis. The array is commercially available, and the marker annotations, initial genotyping results and software used to generate the optimised marker sets are freely available.\nImproving population scale statistical phasing with whole-genome sequencing data\nAuthors: Wertenbroek, R.; Hofmeister, R.; Xenarios, I.; Thoma, Y.; Delaneau, O.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570528\nHaplotype estimation, or phasing, has gained significant traction in large-scale projects due to its valuable contributions to population genetics, variant analysis, and the creation of reference panels for imputation and phasing of new samples. To scale with the growing number of samples, haplotype estimation methods designed for population scale rely on highly optimized statistical models to phase genotype data, and usually ignore read-level information. Statistical methods excel in resolving common variants, however, they still struggle at rare variants due to the lack of statistical information. In this study we introduce SAPPHIRE, a new method that leverages whole genome sequencing data to enhance the precision of haplotype calls produced by statistical phasing. SAPPHIRE achieves this by refining haplotype estimates through the realignment of sequencing reads, particularly targeting low-confidence phase calls. Our findings demonstrate that SAPPHIRE significantly enhances the accuracy of haplotypes obtained from state of the art methods and also provides the subset of phase calls that are validated by sequencing reads. Finally, we show that our method scales to large data sets by its successful application to the extensive 3.6 Petabytes of sequencing data of the last UK Biobank 200,031 sample release.\nEarly Pastoralism in Central European Forests: Insights from Ancient Environmental Genomics\nAuthors: Zampirolo, G.; Holman, L. E.; Sawafuji, R.; Ptakova, M.; Kovacikova, L.; Sida, P.; Pokorny, P.; Pedersen, M. W.; Walls, M.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569562\nCentral European forests have been shaped by complex human interactions throughout the Holocene, with significant changes following the introduction of domesticated animals in the Neolithic ([~]7.5 - 6.0 kyr BP). However, understanding early pastoral practices and their impact on forests is limited by methods for detecting animal movement across past landscapes. Here we examine ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) preserved at the Velky Mamu[t]ak rock shelter, in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic), which has been a forested enclave since the early Holocene. We find that domesticated animals, their associated microbiomes, and plants potentially gathered for fodder, have clear representation by the Late Neolithic, around 6.0 kyr BP, and persist throughout the Bronze Age into recent times. We identify a change in dominant grazing species from sheep to pigs in the Bronze Age ([~]4.1 - 3.0 kyr BP) and interpret the impact this had in the mid-Holocene retrogressions that still define the structure of Central European forests today. This study highlights the ability of ancient metagenomics to bridge archaeological and paleoecological methods and provide an enhanced perspective on the roots of the Anthropocene.\nDiploid genome assembly of the Malbec grapevine cultivar enables haplotype-aware analysis of transcriptomic differences underlying clonal phenotypic variation\nAuthors: Calderon, L.; Carbonell-Bejerano, P.; Munoz, C.; Bree, L.; Sola, C.; Bergamin, D.; Tulle, W.; Gomez-Talquenca, S.; Lanz, C.; Royo, C.; Ibanez, J.; Martinez-Zapater, J. M.; Weigel, D.; Lijavetzky, D.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569420\nGrapevine cultivars (Vitis vinifera L. ssp. vinifera) must be clonally propagated because of their highly heterozygous genomes. Malbec, a France-originated cultivar appreciated for the production of high-quality wines, is the offspring of cultivars Prunelard and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes. Here, we have built a diploid genome assembly of Malbec, after trio binning of PacBio long reads into the two haploid complements inherited from either parent. After haplotype-aware deduplication and corrections, complete assemblies for the two haplophases were obtained with very low haplotype switch-error rate (\u003c0.025). The haplophases alignment identified \u003e25% of polymorphic regions. Gene annotation including RNA-seq transcriptome assembly and ab initio prediction evidence resulted in similar gene model numbers for both haplophases. The annotated diploid assembly was exploited in the transcriptomic comparison of four clonal accessions of Malbec that exhibited variation in berry composition traits. Analysis of the ripening pericarp transcriptome using either haplophases as reference yielded similar results, although some differences were observed. Particularly, among the differentially expressed genes in the Magdeleine-inherited haplotype, we observed an over-representation of hypothetically hemizygous genes. The higher berry anthocyanin content of clonal accession 595 was associated with increased abscisic acid responses, leading to overexpression of secondary metabolism genes and deregulation of genes associated to abiotic stress response. Overall, the results highlight the importance of producing diploid assemblies to fully represent the genomic diversity of highly heterozygous woody crop cultivars and to unveil the molecular bases of clonal phenotypic variation.\nCharacterization of cortical neurodevelopment in vitro using gene expression and morphology profiles from single cells\nAuthors: Sundaresh, A.; Meistermann, D.; Lampela, R.; Yang, Z.; Woldegebriel, R.; Ganna, A.; Costa, P. P.; Kilpinen, H.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569583\nDifferentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) towards different neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. However, in vitro differentiation is a variable process that frequently leads to heterogeneous cell populations that may confound disease-relevant phenotypes. To characterize the baseline and diversity of cortical neurodevelopment in vitro, we differentiated iPSC lines from multiple healthy donors to cortical neurons and profiled the transcriptomes of 60,000 single cells across three timepoints spanning 70 days. We compared the cell types observed in vitro to those seen in vivo and in organoid cultures to assess how well iPSC-derived cells recapitulate neurodevelopment in vivo. We found that over 60% of the cells resembled those seen in the fetal brain with high confidence, while 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes observed in organoids. Further, we used high-content imaging to quantify morphological phenotypes of the differentiating neurons across the same time points using Cell Painting. By modeling the relationship between image-based features and gene expression, we compared cell type- and donor-specific effects across the two modalities at single cell resolution. We found that while morphological features capture broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, they enhance our ability to quantify the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Finally, we show that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive molecular atlas of human cortical neuron development in vitro that introduces a relevant framework for disease modeling.\nAn optimised protocol for quality control of gene therapy vectors using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing\nAuthors: Zeglinski, K.; Montellese, C.; Ritchie, M. E.; Alhamdoosh, M.; Vonarburg, C.; Bowden, R.; Jordi, M.; Gouil, Q.; Aeschimann, F.; Hsu, A.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569756\nDespite recent advances made towards improving the efficacy of lentiviral gene therapies, a sizeable proportion of produced vector contains an incomplete and thus potentially non-functional RNA genome. This can undermine gene delivery by the lentivirus as well as increase manufacturing costs and must be improved to facilitate the widespread clinical implementation of lentiviral gene therapies. Here, we compare three long-read sequencing technologies for their ability to detect issues in vector design and determine Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to be the most powerful. We show how this approach identifies and quantifies incomplete RNA caused by cryptic splicing and polyadenylation sites, including a potential cryptic polyadenylation site in the widely used Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE). Using artificial polyadenylation of the lentiviral RNA, we also identify multiple hairpin-associated truncations in the analysed lentiviral vectors, which account for most of the detected RNA fragments. Finally, we show that these insights can be used for optimization of lentiviral vector design. In summary, Nanopore direct RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for the quality control and optimisation of lentiviral vectors, which may help to improve lentivirus manufacturing and thus the development of higher quality lentiviral gene therapies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Apes possess two sex chromosomes--the male-specific Y and the X shared by males and females. The Y chromosome is crucial for male reproduction, with deletions linked to infertility. The X chromosome carries genes vital for reproduction and cognition. Variation in mating patterns and brain function among great apes suggests corresponding differences in their sex chromosome structure and evolution. However, due to their highly repetitive nature and incomplete reference assemblies, ape sex chromosomes have been challenging to study. Here, using the state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods developed for the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human genome, we produced gapless, complete assemblies of the X and Y chromosomes for five great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans) and a lesser ape, the siamang gibbon. These assemblies completely resolved ampliconic, palindromic, and satellite sequences, including the entire centromeres, allowing us to untangle the intricacies of ape sex chromosome evolution. We found that, compared to the X, ape Y chromosomes vary greatly in size and have low alignability and high levels of structural rearrangements. This divergence on the Y arises from the accumulation of lineage-specific ampliconic regions and palindromes (which are shared more broadly among species on the X) and from the abundance of transposable elements and satellites (which have a lower representation on the X). Our analysis of Y chromosome genes revealed lineage-specific expansions of multi-copy gene families and signatures of purifying selection. In summary, the Y exhibits dynamic evolution, while the X is more stable. Finally, mapping short-read sequencing data from &gt;100 great ape individuals revealed the patterns of diversity and selection on their sex chromosomes, demonstrating the utility of these reference assemblies for studies of great ape evolution. These complete sex chromosome assemblies are expected to further inform conservation genetics of nonhuman apes, all of which are endangered species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advancements of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (sST) have catalyzed significant advancements by facilitating transcriptome-scale spatial gene expression measurement. Despite this progress, efforts to comprehensively benchmark different platforms are currently lacking. The extant variability across technologies and datasets poses challenges in formulating standardized evaluation metrics. In this study, we established a collection of reference tissues and regions characterized by well-defined histological architectures, and used them to generate data to compare six sST methods. We highlighted molecular diffusion as a variable parameter across different methods and tissues, significantly impacting the effective resolutions. Furthermore, we observed that spatial transcriptomic data demonstrate unique attributes beyond merely adding a spatial axis to single-cell data, including an enhanced ability to capture patterned rare cell states along with specific markers, albeit being influenced by multiple factors including sequencing depth and resolution. Our study assists biologists in sST platform selection, and helps foster a consensus on evaluation standards and establish a framework for future benchmarking efforts that can be used as a gold standard for the development and benchmarking of computational tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive DNA that can create variability in genome structure and regulation. The genome of Rhizophagus irregularis, a widely studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), comprises approximately 50% repetitive sequences that include transposable elements (TE). Despite their abundance, two-thirds of TE remain unclassified, and their regulation among AMF life-stages remains unknown. Here, we aimed to improve our understanding of TE diversity and regulation in this model species by curating repeat datasets obtained from chromosome-level assemblies and by investigating their expression across multiple conditions. Our analyses uncovered new TE superfamilies and families in this model symbiont and revealed significant differences in how these sequences evolve both within and between R. irregularis genomes. With this curated TE annotation, we detected that the number of upregulated TE families in colonized roots is four times higher than extraradical mycelium, and their overall expression differs depending on their host. This work provides a fine-scale view of TE diversity and evolution in model plant symbionts and highlights their transcriptional dynamism and specificity during host-microbe interactions. We also provide Hidden Markov Model profiles of TE domains are now available for future manual curation of uncharacterized sequences (https://github.com/jordana-olive/TE-manual-curation/tree/main).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unravelling how gene regulatory networks are remodelled during evolution is crucial to understand how species adapt to environmental changes. We addressed this question for X-chromosome inactivation, a process essential to female development that is governed, in eutherians, by the XIST lncRNA and its cis-regulators. To reach high resolution, we studied closely related primate species, spanning 55 million years of evolution. We show that the XIST regulatory circuitry has diversified extensively over such evolutionary timeframe. The insertion of a HERVK transposon has reshuffled XIST 3D interaction network in macaque embryonic stem cells (ESC) and XIST expression is maintained by the additive effects of the JPX lncRNA gene and a macaque specific enhancer. In contrast, JPX is the main contributor to XIST expression in human ESCs but is not significantly involved in XIST regulation in marmoset ESCs. None of these entities are however under purifying selection, which suggests that neutrally evolving non-coding elements harbour high adaptive potentials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High throughput genotyping arrays have provided a cost effective, reliable and interoperable system for genotyping hexaploid wheat and its related germplasm pool. Existing, highly cited arrays including our 35K Axiom Wheat Breeders genotyping array and the Illumina 90K iSelect array were designed based on a limited amount of varietal sequence diversity and with imperfect knowledge of SNP positions. Recent progress in sequencing wheat varieties and landraces has given us access to a vast pool of SNP diversity, whilst technological improvements in array design has allowed us to fit significantly more probes onto a 384-well format Axiom array than was previously possible. Here we describe a novel High Density Axiom genotyping array, the Triticum aestivum Next Generation array (TaNG), largely derived from whole genome skim sequencing of 204 elite wheat lines and 111 wheat landraces taken from the Watkins &#34;Core Collection&#34;. We use a novel &#34;minimal marker&#34; optimisation approach to select up to six SNPs in each 1.5 MB region of the wheat genome with the highest combined varietal discrimination potential. A design iteration step allowed us to test and replace skim-sequence derived SNPs which failed to convert to reliable Axiom markers, resulting in a final design, designated TaNG1.1 with 43,372 SNPs derived from a haplotype-optimised combination of novel SNPs, DArTAG-derived and legacy wheat Axiom markers. We show that this design has an even distribution of SNPs across chromosomes and sub-genomes compared to previous arrays and can be used to generate genetic maps with a significantly higher number of distinct bins than our previous Axiom array. We also demonstrate the improved performance of TaNG1.1 for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and its utility for Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis. The array is commercially available, and the marker annotations, initial genotyping results and software used to generate the optimised marker sets are freely available.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Haplotype estimation, or phasing, has gained significant traction in large-scale projects due to its valuable contributions to population genetics, variant analysis, and the creation of reference panels for imputation and phasing of new samples. To scale with the growing number of samples, haplotype estimation methods designed for population scale rely on highly optimized statistical models to phase genotype data, and usually ignore read-level information. Statistical methods excel in resolving common variants, however, they still struggle at rare variants due to the lack of statistical information. In this study we introduce SAPPHIRE, a new method that leverages whole genome sequencing data to enhance the precision of haplotype calls produced by statistical phasing. SAPPHIRE achieves this by refining haplotype estimates through the realignment of sequencing reads, particularly targeting low-confidence phase calls. Our findings demonstrate that SAPPHIRE significantly enhances the accuracy of haplotypes obtained from state of the art methods and also provides the subset of phase calls that are validated by sequencing reads. Finally, we show that our method scales to large data sets by its successful application to the extensive 3.6 Petabytes of sequencing data of the last UK Biobank 200,031 sample release.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Central European forests have been shaped by complex human interactions throughout the Holocene, with significant changes following the introduction of domesticated animals in the Neolithic ([~]7.5 - 6.0 kyr BP). However, understanding early pastoral practices and their impact on forests is limited by methods for detecting animal movement across past landscapes. Here we examine ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) preserved at the Velky Mamu[t]ak rock shelter, in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic), which has been a forested enclave since the early Holocene. We find that domesticated animals, their associated microbiomes, and plants potentially gathered for fodder, have clear representation by the Late Neolithic, around 6.0 kyr BP, and persist throughout the Bronze Age into recent times. We identify a change in dominant grazing species from sheep to pigs in the Bronze Age ([~]4.1 - 3.0 kyr BP) and interpret the impact this had in the mid-Holocene retrogressions that still define the structure of Central European forests today. This study highlights the ability of ancient metagenomics to bridge archaeological and paleoecological methods and provide an enhanced perspective on the roots of the Anthropocene.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Grapevine cultivars (Vitis vinifera L. ssp. vinifera) must be clonally propagated because of their highly heterozygous genomes. Malbec, a France-originated cultivar appreciated for the production of high-quality wines, is the offspring of cultivars Prunelard and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes. Here, we have built a diploid genome assembly of Malbec, after trio binning of PacBio long reads into the two haploid complements inherited from either parent. After haplotype-aware deduplication and corrections, complete assemblies for the two haplophases were obtained with very low haplotype switch-error rate (&lt;0.025). The haplophases alignment identified &gt;25% of polymorphic regions. Gene annotation including RNA-seq transcriptome assembly and ab initio prediction evidence resulted in similar gene model numbers for both haplophases. The annotated diploid assembly was exploited in the transcriptomic comparison of four clonal accessions of Malbec that exhibited variation in berry composition traits. Analysis of the ripening pericarp transcriptome using either haplophases as reference yielded similar results, although some differences were observed. Particularly, among the differentially expressed genes in the Magdeleine-inherited haplotype, we observed an over-representation of hypothetically hemizygous genes. The higher berry anthocyanin content of clonal accession 595 was associated with increased abscisic acid responses, leading to overexpression of secondary metabolism genes and deregulation of genes associated to abiotic stress response. Overall, the results highlight the importance of producing diploid assemblies to fully represent the genomic diversity of highly heterozygous woody crop cultivars and to unveil the molecular bases of clonal phenotypic variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) towards different neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. However, in vitro differentiation is a variable process that frequently leads to heterogeneous cell populations that may confound disease-relevant phenotypes. To characterize the baseline and diversity of cortical neurodevelopment in vitro, we differentiated iPSC lines from multiple healthy donors to cortical neurons and profiled the transcriptomes of 60,000 single cells across three timepoints spanning 70 days. We compared the cell types observed in vitro to those seen in vivo and in organoid cultures to assess how well iPSC-derived cells recapitulate neurodevelopment in vivo. We found that over 60% of the cells resembled those seen in the fetal brain with high confidence, while 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes observed in organoids. Further, we used high-content imaging to quantify morphological phenotypes of the differentiating neurons across the same time points using Cell Painting. By modeling the relationship between image-based features and gene expression, we compared cell type- and donor-specific effects across the two modalities at single cell resolution. We found that while morphological features capture broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, they enhance our ability to quantify the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Finally, we show that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive molecular atlas of human cortical neuron development in vitro that introduces a relevant framework for disease modeling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite recent advances made towards improving the efficacy of lentiviral gene therapies, a sizeable proportion of produced vector contains an incomplete and thus potentially non-functional RNA genome. This can undermine gene delivery by the lentivirus as well as increase manufacturing costs and must be improved to facilitate the widespread clinical implementation of lentiviral gene therapies. Here, we compare three long-read sequencing technologies for their ability to detect issues in vector design and determine Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to be the most powerful. We show how this approach identifies and quantifies incomplete RNA caused by cryptic splicing and polyadenylation sites, including a potential cryptic polyadenylation site in the widely used Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE). Using artificial polyadenylation of the lentiviral RNA, we also identify multiple hairpin-associated truncations in the analysed lentiviral vectors, which account for most of the detected RNA fragments. Finally, we show that these insights can be used for optimization of lentiviral vector design. In summary, Nanopore direct RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for the quality control and optimisation of lentiviral vectors, which may help to improve lentivirus manufacturing and thus the development of higher quality lentiviral gene therapies.</p>
