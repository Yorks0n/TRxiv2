Yet, they must recombine, since they sometimes carry nearly identical accessory genes. Phage-plasmids are both plasmids and phages and we found they connect them by being at their interface in the network of gene repertoire relatedness. We searched for recombining genes in all three types of elements and found that phage-plasmid exchange rates are between those of plasmids (highest) and phages (lowest). Phage-plasmids drive gene flow between phages and plasmids, including that of antibiotic resistances and defense systems. Genetic exchanges and gene inactivation resulted in P1-like phage-plasmids turning into integrative prophages or just plasmids. The latter acquired conjugation-related functions thereby transitioning from viral to conjugation-driven horizontal transfer. Phage-plasmids have thus a key role in spreading traits across mobile genetic elements and their hosts, while facilitating conversions of one type of element into another.\nA genome-wide atlas of human cell morphology\nAuthors: Ramezani, M.; Bauman, J.; Singh, A.; Weisbart, E.; Yong, J.; Lozada, M.

T.\nScore: 51.1, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552164\nA key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing data-driven representations of gene function. Here, we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-scale genotype-phenotype maps comprising \u003e20,000 single-gene CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout experiments in \u003e30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling approach (PERISCOPE) combines a de-stainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting1,2) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This approach provides high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells, while simultaneously enabling interrogation of subcellular processes. Our atlas reconstructs known pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, identifies culture media-specific responses to gene knockout, and clusters thousands of human genes by phenotypic similarity. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly-characterized disease-associated transmembrane protein TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, showing the power of these representations. In sum, our atlas and screening technology represent a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale.\nA harmonized public resource of deeply sequenced diverse human genomes\nAuthors: Koenig, Z.; Yohannes, M.

The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) and Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), which have recently been sequenced to high coverage, are valuable genomic resources because of the global diversity they capture and their open data sharing policies. Here, we harmonized a high quality set of 4,096 whole genomes from HGDP and 1kGP with data from gnomAD and identified over 159 million high-quality SNVs, indels, and SVs. We performed a detailed ancestry analysis of this cohort, characterizing population structure and patterns of admixture across populations, analyzing site frequency spectra, and measuring variant counts at global and subcontinental levels. We also demonstrate substantial added value from this dataset compared to the prior versions of the component resources, typically combined via liftover and variant intersection; for example, we catalog millions of new genetic variants, mostly rare, compared to previous releases. In addition to unrestricted individual-level public release, we provide detailed tutorials for conducting many of the most common quality control steps and analyses with these data in a scalable cloud-computing environment and publicly release this new phased joint callset for use as a haplotype resource in phasing and imputation pipelines. This jointly called reference panel will serve as a key resource to support research of diverse ancestry populations.\nPhenotypic variation in maize can be largely explained by genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites\nAuthors: Engelhorn, J.; Snodgrass, S.

Here we report the construction of a pan-cistrome of the maize leaf under well-watered and drought conditions. We quantified haplotype-specific TF footprints across a pan-genome of 25 maize hybrids and mapped nearly two-hundred thousand genetic variants (termed binding-QTLs) linked to cis-element occupancy. The functional significance of binding-QTLs is supported by three lines of evidence: i) they coincide with known causative loci that regulate traits, including novel alleles of Upright Plant Architecture2, Trehalase1, and the MITE transposon near ZmNAC111 under drought; ii) their footprint bias is mirrored between inbred parents and by ChIP-seq; iii) partitioning genetic variation across genomic regions demonstrates that binding-QTLs capture the majority of heritable trait variation across [~]70% of 143 phenotypes. Our study provides a promising approach to make previously hidden cis-variation more accessible for genetic studies and multi-target engineering of complex traits.\nGenome-scale quantification and prediction of pathogenic stop codon readthrough by small molecules\nAuthors: Toledano, I.; Supek, F.; Lehner, B.\nScore: 22.5, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552350\nPremature termination codons (PTCs) cause [~]10-20% of Mendelian diseases and are the major mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer. A general strategy to alleviate the effects of PTCs would be to promote translational readthrough. Nonsense suppression by small molecules has proven effective in diverse disease models, but translation into the clinic is hampered by ineffective readthrough of many PTCs. Here we directly tackle the challenge of defining drug efficacy by quantifying readthrough of [~]5,800 human pathogenic stop codons by 8 drugs. We find that different drugs promote readthrough of complementary subsets of PTCs defined by local sequence context. This allows us to build interpretable models that accurately predict drug-induced readthrough genome-wide. Accurate readthrough quantification and prediction will empower clinical trial design and the development of personalized nonsense suppression therapies.\nUsing deep long-read RNAseq in Alzheimer's disease brain to assess clinical relevance of RNA isoform diversity\nAuthors: Aguzzoli Heberle, B.; Brandon, J.

W.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552162\nDue to alternative splicing, human protein-coding genes average over eight RNA isoforms, resulting in nearly four distinct protein coding sequences per gene. Long-read RNAseq (IsoSeq) enables more accurate quantification of isoforms, shedding light on their specific roles. To assess the clinical relevance of measuring RNA isoform expression, we sequenced 12 aged human frontal cortices (6 Alzheimers disease cases and 6 controls, 50% female) using one Oxford Nanopore PromethION flow cell per sample. Our study uncovered 53 new high-confidence RNA isoforms in clinically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. Specific examples include WDR4 (61%; microcephaly), MYL3 (44%; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and MTHFS (25%; major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Other notable genes with new high-confidence isoforms include CPLX2 (10%; schizophrenia, epilepsy) and MAOB (9%; targeted for Parkinsons disease treatment). We identified 1,917 clinically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in human frontal cortex, where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein coding sequences, demonstrating the need to better understand how individual isoforms from a \"single\" gene are involved in human health and disease. Exactly 98 of the 1,917 genes are implicated in brain-related diseases, including Alzheimers disease genes such as APP (A{beta} precursor protein; five), MAPT (tau protein; four), and BIN1 (eight). We also found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between Alzheimers cases and controls, despite the genes themselves not exhibiting differential expression. Our findings highlight the significant knowledge gaps in RNA isoform diversity and their clinical relevance. Deep long-read RNA sequencing will be necessary going forward to fully comprehend the clinical relevance of individual isoforms for a \"single\" gene.\nThe defensome of complex bacterial communities\nAuthors: Beavogui, A.; Lacroix, A.; Wiart, N.; Poulain, J.; Delmont, T. O.; Paoli, L.; Wincker, P.; Oliveira, P. H.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553040\nBacteria have developed various defense mechanisms to avoid infection and killing in response to the fast evolution and turnover of viruses and other genetic parasites. Such pan-immune system (or defensome) encompasses a growing number of defense lines that include well-studied innate and adaptive systems such as abortive infection, CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification, but also newly found ones whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. While the abundance and distribution of defense systems is well-known in complete and culturable genomes, there is a void in our understanding of their diversity and richness in complex microbial communities. Here we performed a large-scale in-depth analysis of the defensomes of 7,759 high-quality bacterial population genomes reconstructed from soil, marine, and human gut environments. We observed a wide variation in the frequency and nature of the defensome among large phyla, which correlated with lifestyle, genome size, habitat, and geographic background. The defensome genetic mobility, its clustering in defense islands, and genetic variability was found to be system-specific and shaped by the bacterial environment. Hence, our results provide a detailed picture of the multiple immune barriers present in environmentally distinct bacterial communities and set the stage for subsequent identification of novel and ingenious strategies of diversification among uncultivated microbes.\nThe effects of reference panel perturbations on the accuracy of genotype imputation\nAuthors: Li, J. H.; Liu, A.; Buerkle, C. A.; Palmer, W.; Belbin, G. M.; Ahangari, M.; Gibson, M. J.; Flagel, L.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552684\nReference-based genotype imputation is a standard technique that has become increasingly popular in large-scale studies involving genomic data. The two key elements involved in the process of genotype imputation are (1) the haplotype reference panel to which a target individual is being imputed, and (2) the imputation algorithm used to infer missing genotypes in the target individual. The imputation literature has historically focused mainly on (2), with a typical comparative study investigating the relative performance of various imputation algorithms while holding the reference panel constant. However, the role of the reference panel itself (1) on overall imputation performance is equally, if not more, important than the choice among many high-performing algorithms. Even though it is intuitive that the quality of a reference panel should play a role in the accuracy of imputation, it is nonetheless unclear to what extent common errors during panel creation (e.g., genotyping and phase error) lead to suboptimal imputation performance. In this study, we investigate the effects of applying three distinct modes of perturbations to a widely used haplotype reference panel in human genetics on the resulting imputation accuracy. Specifically, we perturb the reference panel by (1) randomly introducing phase errors, (2) randomly introducing genotype errors, and (3) randomly pruning variants from the panel (all at varying magnitudes). We then impute a set of diverse individuals at various sequencing coverages (0.5x, 1.0x, and 2.0x) to these various perturbed panels and evaluate imputation accuracy using the r2 metric for the entire cohort as well as ancestry-stratified subsets. We observe that both phase- and genotype-perturbations can dramatically affect imputation accuracy, particularly at very low allele frequencies, while pruning variants has a far smaller effect. We then empirically verified that our simulations reliably predict the impact of potential filtering techniques in a real-world dataset. In the context of haplotype reference panels, these results suggest that phasing and genotyping accuracy are far more important than the density of a reference panel used for imputation.\nThe human genome's vocabulary as proposed by the DNA language model GROVER\nAuthors: Sanabria, M.; Hirsch, J.; Poetsch, A. R.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549677\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) on natural language have achieved a level of performance that allows the generation of coherent and syntactically correct text. DNA sequence of genomes follows rules similar to natural language, but a distinguishing factor is the absence of a concept analogous to words. We established byte-pair tokenization on the human genome and trained a foundation language model called GROVER (\"Genome Rules Obtained Via Extracted Representations\") to select the optimal vocabulary with a custom fine-tuning task of next-k-mer prediction. We thus defined a dictionary of words/tokens in the human genome that best carries the information content for DNA language models. Analyzing GROVERs learned representations, we observed that token embeddings primarily encode information related to their frequency, sequence content, and length. Some tokens are almost exclusively localized in repeats, while the vast majority widely distributes over the genome. The model also learns context and lexical ambiguity. Average embeddings of genomic regions relate to functional genomics annotation and thus indicate that GROVER has learned these structures purely from the contextual relationships of tokens. That we can extract functional annotations from the genome, purely based on sequence representation to the trained model, highlights the extent of information content encoded by the sequence. This is supported by fine-tuning tasks on genome biology with questions of promoter identity and protein-DNA binding. GROVER learns sequence context, a sense for grammatical structures and language rules in the genome. This knowledge can be extracted and used to compose a grammar book for the code of life.\nA computational pipeline for spatial mechano-transcriptomics\nAuthors: Hallou, A.; He, R.; Simons, B. D.; Dumitrascu, B.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551894\nAdvances in spatial profiling technologies are providing insights into how molecular programs are influenced by local signaling and environmental cues. However, cell fate specification and tissue patterning involve the interplay of biochemical and mechanical feedback. Here, we develop a computational framework that enables the joint statistical analysis of transcriptional and mechanical signals in the context of spatial transcriptomics. To illustrate the application and utility of the approach, we use spatial transcriptomics data from the developing mouse embryo to infer the forces acting on individual cells, and use these results to identify mechanical, morphometric, and gene expression signatures that are predictive of tissue compartment boundaries. In addition, we use geoadditive structural equation modeling to identify gene modules that predict the mechanical behavior of cells in an unbiased manner. This computational framework is easily generalized to other spatial profiling contexts, providing a generic scheme for exploring the interplay of biomolecular and mechanical cues in tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Phages and plasmids have key roles in bacterial evolution and are usually very different. Yet, they must recombine, since they sometimes carry nearly identical accessory genes. Phage-plasmids are both plasmids and phages and we found they connect them by being at their interface in the network of gene repertoire relatedness. We searched for recombining genes in all three types of elements and found that phage-plasmid exchange rates are between those of plasmids (highest) and phages (lowest). Phage-plasmids drive gene flow between phages and plasmids, including that of antibiotic resistances and defense systems. Genetic exchanges and gene inactivation resulted in P1-like phage-plasmids turning into integrative prophages or just plasmids. The latter acquired conjugation-related functions thereby transitioning from viral to conjugation-driven horizontal transfer. Phage-plasmids have thus a key role in spreading traits across mobile genetic elements and their hosts, while facilitating conversions of one type of element into another.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing data-driven representations of gene function. Here, we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-scale genotype-phenotype maps comprising &gt;20,000 single-gene CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout experiments in &gt;30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling approach (PERISCOPE) combines a de-stainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting1,2) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This approach provides high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells, while simultaneously enabling interrogation of subcellular processes. Our atlas reconstructs known pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, identifies culture media-specific responses to gene knockout, and clusters thousands of human genes by phenotypic similarity. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly-characterized disease-associated transmembrane protein TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, showing the power of these representations. In sum, our atlas and screening technology represent a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Underrepresented populations are often excluded from genomic studies due in part to a lack of resources supporting their analyses. The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) and Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), which have recently been sequenced to high coverage, are valuable genomic resources because of the global diversity they capture and their open data sharing policies. Here, we harmonized a high quality set of 4,096 whole genomes from HGDP and 1kGP with data from gnomAD and identified over 159 million high-quality SNVs, indels, and SVs. We performed a detailed ancestry analysis of this cohort, characterizing population structure and patterns of admixture across populations, analyzing site frequency spectra, and measuring variant counts at global and subcontinental levels. We also demonstrate substantial added value from this dataset compared to the prior versions of the component resources, typically combined via liftover and variant intersection; for example, we catalog millions of new genetic variants, mostly rare, compared to previous releases. In addition to unrestricted individual-level public release, we provide detailed tutorials for conducting many of the most common quality control steps and analyses with these data in a scalable cloud-computing environment and publicly release this new phased joint callset for use as a haplotype resource in phasing and imputation pipelines. This jointly called reference panel will serve as a key resource to support research of diverse ancestry populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Comprehensive maps of functional variation at transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) are crucial for elucidating how genotype shapes phenotype. Here we report the construction of a pan-cistrome of the maize leaf under well-watered and drought conditions. We quantified haplotype-specific TF footprints across a pan-genome of 25 maize hybrids and mapped nearly two-hundred thousand genetic variants (termed binding-QTLs) linked to cis-element occupancy. The functional significance of binding-QTLs is supported by three lines of evidence: i) they coincide with known causative loci that regulate traits, including novel alleles of Upright Plant Architecture2, Trehalase1, and the MITE transposon near ZmNAC111 under drought; ii) their footprint bias is mirrored between inbred parents and by ChIP-seq; iii) partitioning genetic variation across genomic regions demonstrates that binding-QTLs capture the majority of heritable trait variation across [~]70% of 143 phenotypes. Our study provides a promising approach to make previously hidden cis-variation more accessible for genetic studies and multi-target engineering of complex traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Premature termination codons (PTCs) cause [~]10-20% of Mendelian diseases and are the major mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer. A general strategy to alleviate the effects of PTCs would be to promote translational readthrough. Nonsense suppression by small molecules has proven effective in diverse disease models, but translation into the clinic is hampered by ineffective readthrough of many PTCs. Here we directly tackle the challenge of defining drug efficacy by quantifying readthrough of [~]5,800 human pathogenic stop codons by 8 drugs. We find that different drugs promote readthrough of complementary subsets of PTCs defined by local sequence context. This allows us to build interpretable models that accurately predict drug-induced readthrough genome-wide. Accurate readthrough quantification and prediction will empower clinical trial design and the development of personalized nonsense suppression therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to alternative splicing, human protein-coding genes average over eight RNA isoforms, resulting in nearly four distinct protein coding sequences per gene. Long-read RNAseq (IsoSeq) enables more accurate quantification of isoforms, shedding light on their specific roles. To assess the clinical relevance of measuring RNA isoform expression, we sequenced 12 aged human frontal cortices (6 Alzheimers disease cases and 6 controls, 50% female) using one Oxford Nanopore PromethION flow cell per sample. Our study uncovered 53 new high-confidence RNA isoforms in clinically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. Specific examples include WDR4 (61%; microcephaly), MYL3 (44%; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and MTHFS (25%; major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Other notable genes with new high-confidence isoforms include CPLX2 (10%; schizophrenia, epilepsy) and MAOB (9%; targeted for Parkinsons disease treatment). We identified 1,917 clinically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in human frontal cortex, where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein coding sequences, demonstrating the need to better understand how individual isoforms from a &#34;single&#34; gene are involved in human health and disease. Exactly 98 of the 1,917 genes are implicated in brain-related diseases, including Alzheimers disease genes such as APP (A{beta} precursor protein; five), MAPT (tau protein; four), and BIN1 (eight). We also found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between Alzheimers cases and controls, despite the genes themselves not exhibiting differential expression. Our findings highlight the significant knowledge gaps in RNA isoform diversity and their clinical relevance. Deep long-read RNA sequencing will be necessary going forward to fully comprehend the clinical relevance of individual isoforms for a &#34;single&#34; gene.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms to avoid infection and killing in response to the fast evolution and turnover of viruses and other genetic parasites. Such pan-immune system (or defensome) encompasses a growing number of defense lines that include well-studied innate and adaptive systems such as abortive infection, CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification, but also newly found ones whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. While the abundance and distribution of defense systems is well-known in complete and culturable genomes, there is a void in our understanding of their diversity and richness in complex microbial communities. Here we performed a large-scale in-depth analysis of the defensomes of 7,759 high-quality bacterial population genomes reconstructed from soil, marine, and human gut environments. We observed a wide variation in the frequency and nature of the defensome among large phyla, which correlated with lifestyle, genome size, habitat, and geographic background. The defensome genetic mobility, its clustering in defense islands, and genetic variability was found to be system-specific and shaped by the bacterial environment. Hence, our results provide a detailed picture of the multiple immune barriers present in environmentally distinct bacterial communities and set the stage for subsequent identification of novel and ingenious strategies of diversification among uncultivated microbes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reference-based genotype imputation is a standard technique that has become increasingly popular in large-scale studies involving genomic data. The two key elements involved in the process of genotype imputation are (1) the haplotype reference panel to which a target individual is being imputed, and (2) the imputation algorithm used to infer missing genotypes in the target individual. The imputation literature has historically focused mainly on (2), with a typical comparative study investigating the relative performance of various imputation algorithms while holding the reference panel constant. However, the role of the reference panel itself (1) on overall imputation performance is equally, if not more, important than the choice among many high-performing algorithms. Even though it is intuitive that the quality of a reference panel should play a role in the accuracy of imputation, it is nonetheless unclear to what extent common errors during panel creation (e.g., genotyping and phase error) lead to suboptimal imputation performance. In this study, we investigate the effects of applying three distinct modes of perturbations to a widely used haplotype reference panel in human genetics on the resulting imputation accuracy. Specifically, we perturb the reference panel by (1) randomly introducing phase errors, (2) randomly introducing genotype errors, and (3) randomly pruning variants from the panel (all at varying magnitudes). We then impute a set of diverse individuals at various sequencing coverages (0.5x, 1.0x, and 2.0x) to these various perturbed panels and evaluate imputation accuracy using the r2 metric for the entire cohort as well as ancestry-stratified subsets. We observe that both phase- and genotype-perturbations can dramatically affect imputation accuracy, particularly at very low allele frequencies, while pruning variants has a far smaller effect. We then empirically verified that our simulations reliably predict the impact of potential filtering techniques in a real-world dataset. In the context of haplotype reference panels, these results suggest that phasing and genotyping accuracy are far more important than the density of a reference panel used for imputation.</p>

DNA sequence of genomes follows rules similar to natural language, but a distinguishing factor is the absence of a concept analogous to words. We established byte-pair tokenization on the human genome and trained a foundation language model called GROVER (&#34;Genome Rules Obtained Via Extracted Representations&#34;) to select the optimal vocabulary with a custom fine-tuning task of next-k-mer prediction. We thus defined a dictionary of words/tokens in the human genome that best carries the information content for DNA language models. Analyzing GROVERs learned representations, we observed that token embeddings primarily encode information related to their frequency, sequence content, and length. Some tokens are almost exclusively localized in repeats, while the vast majority widely distributes over the genome. The model also learns context and lexical ambiguity. Average embeddings of genomic regions relate to functional genomics annotation and thus indicate that GROVER has learned these structures purely from the contextual relationships of tokens. That we can extract functional annotations from the genome, purely based on sequence representation to the trained model, highlights the extent of information content encoded by the sequence. This is supported by fine-tuning tasks on genome biology with questions of promoter identity and protein-DNA binding. GROVER learns sequence context, a sense for grammatical structures and language rules in the genome. This knowledge can be extracted and used to compose a grammar book for the code of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advances in spatial profiling technologies are providing insights into how molecular programs are influenced by local signaling and environmental cues. However, cell fate specification and tissue patterning involve the interplay of biochemical and mechanical feedback. Here, we develop a computational framework that enables the joint statistical analysis of transcriptional and mechanical signals in the context of spatial transcriptomics. To illustrate the application and utility of the approach, we use spatial transcriptomics data from the developing mouse embryo to infer the forces acting on individual cells, and use these results to identify mechanical, morphometric, and gene expression signatures that are predictive of tissue compartment boundaries. In addition, we use geoadditive structural equation modeling to identify gene modules that predict the mechanical behavior of cells in an unbiased manner. This computational framework is easily generalized to other spatial profiling contexts, providing a generic scheme for exploring the interplay of biomolecular and mechanical cues in tissues.</p>
