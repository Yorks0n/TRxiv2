In 2022 and 2023, two HKU4-related CoV strains were discovered in Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) metagenomic datasets derived from organ samples: HKU4-P251T and MjHKU4r-CoV-1. Together with the Tylonycteris robustula bat CoV 162275, which was discovered in 2022, pangolin CoVs HKU4-P251T and MjHKU4r-CoV-1 form a novel phylogenetic clade distinct from all previously documented HKU4-related CoVs. In this study, we identified a novel HKU4-related CoV in a pangolin single-cell sequencing dataset generated by BGI-Shenzhen in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2020. The CoV phylogenetically belongs to the same newly identified clade. The single cell datasets were reported as generated from organ samples of a single pangolin that died of natural causes. 98% of the HKU4-related CoV reads were found in only one of the seven single cell datasets -- a large intestine cell dataset, cells of which exhibit low expression of DPP4. Bacterial contamination was found to be moderately correlated with HKU4-related CoV presence. We further identified with high confidence that the RNA-Seq dataset supporting one of four near identical variants of MjHKU4r-CoV-1 is a Sus scrofa (wild pig) metagenomic dataset, with only a trace level of Manis javanica genomic content. The presence of HKU4-related CoV reads in the dataset are almost certainly laboratory research-related and not from a premortal pangolin or pig infection. Our findings raise concerns about the provenance of the novel HKU4-related CoV we identify here, MjHKU4r-CoV-1 and its four near-identical variants.\nDark side of the honeymoon: reconstructing the Asian x European rose breeding history through the lens of genomics\nAuthors: Leroy, T.; Albert, E.; Thouroude, T.; Baudino, S.; Caissard, J.-C.; Chastellier, A.; Chameau, J.; Jeauffre, J.; Loubert, T.; Paramita, S.

H.-S.; Clotault, J.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546162\nRoses have a specific symbolic charge in Western cultural heritage, often used as a metaphor for love and romance. Despite its ancient cultivation, the passion for the phenotypic diversity of roses is relatively recent, dating back to the early 19th century. During that century, the number of rose varieties has increased exponentially from roughly 100 to 8,000, in such a way that this period can be considered as the golden age for rose breeding. To retrace the history of rose breeding in Europe and shed new light on genetic changes during this period, we collected large phenotypic and genetic data from 204 accessions, including botanical roses and varieties bred between 1800 and 1910. We also used whole-genome sequences from 32 accessions as an extra resource. The genetic makeup of roses is remarkably consistent with a temporal shift from a historical European to a near-Asian genetic background within a few generations. Our analyses are consistent with a substantial erosion of the genetic diversity during this period, both because of the greater contribution of the Asian genepool - a less genetically diverse group - and of specific genomic footprints of selection, in particular regarding the extension of the blooming period. Thanks to this study, we have generated the largest GWAS catalog for roses to date, which can be used as a tool for future rose breeding programs. We particularly discuss the crucial importance of preserving ancient rose collections to safeguard genetic diversity and ensure a sustainable breeding for the long-term.\nAccounting for statistical non-additive interactions enables the recovery of missing heritability from GWAS summary statistics\nAuthors: Smith, S. P.; Darnell, G.; Udwin, D.; Harpak, A.; Ramachandran, S.; Crawford, L.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.21.501001\nLD score regression (LDSC) is a method to estimate narrow-sense heritability from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone, making it a fast and popular approach. The key concept underlying the LDSC framework is that there is a positive linear relationship between the magnitude of GWAS allelic effect estimates and linkage disequilibrium (LD) when complex traits are generated under the infinitesimal model -- that is, causal variants are uniformly distributed along the genome and each have the same expected contribution to phenotypic variation. We present interaction-LD score (i-LDSC) regression: an extension of the original LDSC framework that accounts for non-additive genetic effects. By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a cis-interaction score (i.e., interactions between a focal variant and nearby variants) significantly recovers substantial non-additive heritability that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and 23 of the 25 traits analyzed in BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects a significant amount of variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.\nA Risk-reward Examination of Sample Multiplexing Reagents for Single Cell RNA-Seq\nAuthors: Brown, D.

However the choice of sample multiplexing reagents can impact data quality and experimental outcomes. In this study, we compared various multiplexing reagents, including MULTI-Seq, Hashtag antibody, and CellPlex, across diverse sample types such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mouse embryonic brain and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We found that all multiplexing reagents worked well in cell types robust to ex vivo manipulation but suffered from signal-to-noise issues in more delicate sample types. We compared multiple demultiplexing algorithms which differed in performance depending on data quality. We find that minor improvements to laboratory workflows such as titration and rapid processing are critical to optimal performance. We also compared the performance of fixed scRNA-Seq kits and highlight the advantages of the Parse Biosciences kit for fragile samples. Highly multiplexed scRNA-Seq experiments require more sequencing resources, therefore we evaluated CRISPR-based destruction of non-informative genes to enhance sequencing value. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the selection of appropriate sample multiplexing reagents and protocols for scRNASeq experiments, facilitating more accurate and cost-effective studies.\nCapTrap-Seq: A platform-agnostic and quantitative approach for high-fidelity full-length RNA transcript sequencing\nAuthors: Carbonell-Sala, S.; Lagarde, J.; Nishiyori, H.; Palumbo, E.; Arnan, C.; Takahashi, H.; Carninci, P.; Uszczynska-Ratajczak, B.; Guigo, R.\nScore: 25.6, Published: 2023-06-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.543444\nLong-read RNA sequencing is essential to produce accurate and exhaustive annotation of eukaryotic genomes. Despite advancements in throughput and accuracy, achieving reliable end-to-end identification of RNA transcripts remains a challenge for long-read sequencing methods. To address this limitation, we developed CapTrap-seq, a cDNA library preparation method, which combines the Cap-trapping strategy with oligo(dT) priming to detect 5capped, full-length transcripts, together with the data processing pipeline LyRic. We benchmarked CapTrap-seq and other popular RNA-seq library preparation protocols in a number of human tissues using both ONT and PacBio sequencing. To assess the accuracy of the transcript models produced, we introduced a capping strategy for synthetic RNA spike-in sequences that mimics the natural 5cap formation in RNA spike-in molecules. We found that the vast majority (up to 90%) of transcript models that LyRic derives from CapTrap-seq reads are full-length. This makes it possible to produce highly accurate annotations with minimal human intervention.\nComparative 3D genome analysis between neural retina and RPE reveals differential cis-regulatory interactions at retinal disease loci\nAuthors: D'haene, E.; Soriano, V. L.; Martinez-Garcia, P. M.; Kalayanamontri, S.; Rey, A. D.; Sousa-Ortega, A.; Naranjo, S.; Van de Sompele, S.; Vantomme, L.; Mahieu, Q.; Vergult, S.; Neto, A. B.; Gomez-Skarmeta, J. L.; Martinez-Morales, J. R.; Bauwens, M.; Tena, J. J.; De Baere, E.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.543842\nVision depends on the functional interplay between the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina and the supporting cells of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Most genes involved in inherited retinal diseases (IRD) display highly specific spatiotemporal expression within these interconnected retinal components through the local recruitment of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in 3D nuclear space. To understand the role of differential chromatin architecture in establishing tissue-specific expression patterns at IRD loci in the human neural retina and the RPE, we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions by applying in situ Hi-C and H3K4me3 HiChIP to human adult post-mortem donor retinas. A comparative 3D genome analysis between neural retina and RPE/choroid revealed that almost 60% of 290 known IRD genes were marked by differential 3D genome structure and/or cis-regulatory interactions. One of these genes was ABCA4, which is implicated in the most common autosomal recessive IRD. We zoomed in on tissue-specific chromatin interactions at the ABCA4 locus using high-resolution UMI-4C assays. Upon integration with bulk and single-cell epigenomic datasets and in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, we revealed tissue-specific CREs interacting with ABCA4. In summary, through extensive comparative 3D genome mapping, based on genome-wide (Hi-C), promoter-centric (HiChIP) and locus-specific (UMI-4C) assays of human neural retina and RPE, we have shown that gene regulation at key IRD loci is likely mediated by tissue-specific chromatin interactions. These findings do not only provide insight into tissue-specific regulatory landscapes of IRD genes, but also delineate the search space for non-coding genomic variation underlying unsolved IRD.

        <p class="abstract">HKU4-related coronaviruses (CoVs) are merbecoviruses related to Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In 2022 and 2023, two HKU4-related CoV strains were discovered in Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) metagenomic datasets derived from organ samples: HKU4-P251T and MjHKU4r-CoV-1. Together with the Tylonycteris robustula bat CoV 162275, which was discovered in 2022, pangolin CoVs HKU4-P251T and MjHKU4r-CoV-1 form a novel phylogenetic clade distinct from all previously documented HKU4-related CoVs. In this study, we identified a novel HKU4-related CoV in a pangolin single-cell sequencing dataset generated by BGI-Shenzhen in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2020. The CoV phylogenetically belongs to the same newly identified clade. The single cell datasets were reported as generated from organ samples of a single pangolin that died of natural causes. 98% of the HKU4-related CoV reads were found in only one of the seven single cell datasets -- a large intestine cell dataset, cells of which exhibit low expression of DPP4. Bacterial contamination was found to be moderately correlated with HKU4-related CoV presence. We further identified with high confidence that the RNA-Seq dataset supporting one of four near identical variants of MjHKU4r-CoV-1 is a Sus scrofa (wild pig) metagenomic dataset, with only a trace level of Manis javanica genomic content. The presence of HKU4-related CoV reads in the dataset are almost certainly laboratory research-related and not from a premortal pangolin or pig infection. Our findings raise concerns about the provenance of the novel HKU4-related CoV we identify here, MjHKU4r-CoV-1 and its four near-identical variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Roses have a specific symbolic charge in Western cultural heritage, often used as a metaphor for love and romance. Despite its ancient cultivation, the passion for the phenotypic diversity of roses is relatively recent, dating back to the early 19th century. During that century, the number of rose varieties has increased exponentially from roughly 100 to 8,000, in such a way that this period can be considered as the golden age for rose breeding. To retrace the history of rose breeding in Europe and shed new light on genetic changes during this period, we collected large phenotypic and genetic data from 204 accessions, including botanical roses and varieties bred between 1800 and 1910. We also used whole-genome sequences from 32 accessions as an extra resource. The genetic makeup of roses is remarkably consistent with a temporal shift from a historical European to a near-Asian genetic background within a few generations. Our analyses are consistent with a substantial erosion of the genetic diversity during this period, both because of the greater contribution of the Asian genepool - a less genetically diverse group - and of specific genomic footprints of selection, in particular regarding the extension of the blooming period. Thanks to this study, we have generated the largest GWAS catalog for roses to date, which can be used as a tool for future rose breeding programs. We particularly discuss the crucial importance of preserving ancient rose collections to safeguard genetic diversity and ensure a sustainable breeding for the long-term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">LD score regression (LDSC) is a method to estimate narrow-sense heritability from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone, making it a fast and popular approach. The key concept underlying the LDSC framework is that there is a positive linear relationship between the magnitude of GWAS allelic effect estimates and linkage disequilibrium (LD) when complex traits are generated under the infinitesimal model -- that is, causal variants are uniformly distributed along the genome and each have the same expected contribution to phenotypic variation. We present interaction-LD score (i-LDSC) regression: an extension of the original LDSC framework that accounts for non-additive genetic effects. By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a cis-interaction score (i.e., interactions between a focal variant and nearby variants) significantly recovers substantial non-additive heritability that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and 23 of the 25 traits analyzed in BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects a significant amount of variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. However the choice of sample multiplexing reagents can impact data quality and experimental outcomes. In this study, we compared various multiplexing reagents, including MULTI-Seq, Hashtag antibody, and CellPlex, across diverse sample types such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mouse embryonic brain and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We found that all multiplexing reagents worked well in cell types robust to ex vivo manipulation but suffered from signal-to-noise issues in more delicate sample types. We compared multiple demultiplexing algorithms which differed in performance depending on data quality. We find that minor improvements to laboratory workflows such as titration and rapid processing are critical to optimal performance. We also compared the performance of fixed scRNA-Seq kits and highlight the advantages of the Parse Biosciences kit for fragile samples. Highly multiplexed scRNA-Seq experiments require more sequencing resources, therefore we evaluated CRISPR-based destruction of non-informative genes to enhance sequencing value. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the selection of appropriate sample multiplexing reagents and protocols for scRNASeq experiments, facilitating more accurate and cost-effective studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long-read RNA sequencing is essential to produce accurate and exhaustive annotation of eukaryotic genomes. Despite advancements in throughput and accuracy, achieving reliable end-to-end identification of RNA transcripts remains a challenge for long-read sequencing methods. To address this limitation, we developed CapTrap-seq, a cDNA library preparation method, which combines the Cap-trapping strategy with oligo(dT) priming to detect 5capped, full-length transcripts, together with the data processing pipeline LyRic. We benchmarked CapTrap-seq and other popular RNA-seq library preparation protocols in a number of human tissues using both ONT and PacBio sequencing. To assess the accuracy of the transcript models produced, we introduced a capping strategy for synthetic RNA spike-in sequences that mimics the natural 5cap formation in RNA spike-in molecules. We found that the vast majority (up to 90%) of transcript models that LyRic derives from CapTrap-seq reads are full-length. This makes it possible to produce highly accurate annotations with minimal human intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vision depends on the functional interplay between the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina and the supporting cells of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Most genes involved in inherited retinal diseases (IRD) display highly specific spatiotemporal expression within these interconnected retinal components through the local recruitment of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in 3D nuclear space.

To understand the role of differential chromatin architecture in establishing tissue-specific expression patterns at IRD loci in the human neural retina and the RPE, we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions by applying in situ Hi-C and H3K4me3 HiChIP to human adult post-mortem donor retinas. A comparative 3D genome analysis between neural retina and RPE/choroid revealed that almost 60% of 290 known IRD genes were marked by differential 3D genome structure and/or cis-regulatory interactions. One of these genes was ABCA4, which is implicated in the most common autosomal recessive IRD. We zoomed in on tissue-specific chromatin interactions at the ABCA4 locus using high-resolution UMI-4C assays. Upon integration with bulk and single-cell epigenomic datasets and in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, we revealed tissue-specific CREs interacting with ABCA4.

In summary, through extensive comparative 3D genome mapping, based on genome-wide (Hi-C), promoter-centric (HiChIP) and locus-specific (UMI-4C) assays of human neural retina and RPE, we have shown that gene regulation at key IRD loci is likely mediated by tissue-specific chromatin interactions. These findings do not only provide insight into tissue-specific regulatory landscapes of IRD genes, but also delineate the search space for non-coding genomic variation underlying unsolved IRD.
