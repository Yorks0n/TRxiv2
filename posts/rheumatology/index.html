MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study investigating breakthrough COVID-19 among RA patients at Mass General Brigham in Boston, MA, USA. Patients were followed from the date of 3rd vaccine dose until breakthrough COVID-19, death, or end of follow-up (18/Jan/2023). Covariates included demographics, lifestyle, comorbidities, and prior COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate breakthrough COVID-19 risk by immunomodulator drug class. We used propensity score (PS) overlap-weighting to compare users of CD20i vs. TNFi. ResultsWe analyzed 5781 patients with RA that received 3 mRNA vaccine doses (78.8% female, mean age 64.2 years). During mean follow-up of 12.8 months, 1173 (20.2%) had breakthrough COVID_19. Use of CD20i (adjusted HR 1.74, 95%CI 1.30-2.33) and glucocorticoid monotherapy (adjusted HR 1.47, 95%CI 1.09-1.98) were each associated with breakthrough COVID-19 compared to TNFi use. In the PS overlap-weighted analysis, CD20i users also had higher breakthrough COVID-19 risk than TNFi users (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.02-2.56). A sensitivity analysis excluding patients with cancer or interstitial lung disease yielded similar findings. ConclusionsWe identified CD20i and glucocorticoid monotherapy as risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19 among patients with RA after a 3rd vaccine dose.

R.; Nieto-Caballero, V. E.; Lefton, M.; Nigrovic, P. A.; Ermann, J.; Gutierrez-Arcelus, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295912\nObjectiveMultiple lines of evidence indicate that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a lymphocyte-driven disease. However, which lymphocyte populations are critical in AS pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we aimed to identify the key cell types mediating the genetic risk in AS using an unbiased integrative functional genomics approach. MethodsWe integrated GWAS data with epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets of immune cells in healthy humans. To quantify enrichment of cell type-specific open chromatin regions or gene expression in AS risk loci, we used three published methods which have identified cell types for other diseases. Additionally, we performed co-localization analyses between GWAS risk loci and genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTL) to find putative target genes of AS risk variants. ResultsNatural killer (NK) cell-specific open chromatin regions are significantly enriched in heritability for AS, compared to other immune cell types such as T cells, B cells, and monocytes. This finding was consistent between two AS GWAS. Using RNA-seq data, we validated that genes in AS risk loci are enriched in NK cell-specific gene expression. Expression levels of AS-associated genes, such as RUNX3, TBX21, TNFRSF1A, and NPEPPS, were found to be highest in NK cells compared to five T cell subsets. Using the human Space-Time Gut Cell Atlas we found significant upregulation of AS-associated genes predominantly in NK cells. Co-localization analysis revealed four AS risk loci affecting regulation of candidate target genes in NK cells: two known loci, ERAP1 and TNFRSF1A, and two under-studied loci, ENTR1 (aka SDCCAG3) and B3GNT2. ConclusionOur results point to NK cells as potential key drivers in the development of AS and highlight four putative target genes for functional follow-up in NK cells.\n",

ResultsNatural killer (NK) cell-specific open chromatin regions are significantly enriched in heritability for AS, compared to other immune cell types such as T cells, B cells, and monocytes. This finding was consistent between two AS GWAS. Using RNA-seq data, we validated that genes in AS risk loci are enriched in NK cell-specific gene expression. Expression levels of AS-associated genes, such as RUNX3, TBX21, TNFRSF1A, and NPEPPS, were found to be highest in NK cells compared to five T cell subsets. Using the human Space-Time Gut Cell Atlas we found significant upregulation of AS-associated genes predominantly in NK cells. Co-localization analysis revealed four AS risk loci affecting regulation of candidate target genes in NK cells: two known loci, ERAP1 and TNFRSF1A, and two under-studied loci, ENTR1 (aka SDCCAG3) and B3GNT2.

ConclusionOur results point to NK cells as potential key drivers in the development of AS and highlight four putative target genes for functional follow-up in NK cells.</p>
