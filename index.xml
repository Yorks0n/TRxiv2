      <description>Effects of Buprenorphine, Methadone and Substance-Use on COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality
Authors: CHRISTIAN, N.; ZHOU, X.; RADHAKRISHNAN, R.
Score: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298995
ObjectivesSubstance use disorder has been associated with increased morbidity in COVID-19 infection. However, less is known about the impact of active substance use and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) on COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of substance use, namely cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, sedative and opioid use as well as buprenorphine or methadone = on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.</description>

Score: 19.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452
Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability.</description>

Cas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments.

The design of regulatory elements is pivotal in numerous therapeutic interventions, including gene and cell therapy, wherein the typical objective is to engineer DNA sequences exhibiting specific attributes like cell-type specificity and elevated expression levels. However, the systematic assessment of these constructed DNA sequences remains challenging due to the absence of robust metrics and an integrated software framework.</description>

Score: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568594
Tissue development occurs through a complex interplay between many individual cells. Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development.</description>

O_LIUnderstanding how competition varies with environmental stress is critical to anticipating species and community responses to rapid environmental change. While the stress-gradient hypothesis predicts the strength of competition to decrease with increasing stress, our understanding of how competition varies with stress is limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding of how resource-use traits underlying competitive dynamics respond to stress.</description>

Worldwide, the majority of antibiotics are prescribed for upper respiratory infections, much of which could be avoided with highly accurate methods of diagnosing or excluding pneumonia at the bedside.

      <description>Development and Outcomes of an International Certificate Program in Science Policy and Advocacy for STEM PhD Students and Postdocs
Authors: Bankston, A.; Ralston, A.; Ly, J.; Singh, H.
Score: 6.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568726
Scientists must play a significant role in enacting societal change by educating and advising policymakers on relevant policy topics. To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy &amp;amp; Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020.</description>

      <description>Extreme miniaturization in plasmid design: generation of the 903 bp cloning vector pICOt2
Authors: Staal, J.; Beyaert, R.
Score: 37.5, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569326
Inspired by the size optimizations in the recently published pUdO series of plasmids, we set out to break our previous world record (pICOz, 1185 bp) in designing the smallest possible self-replicating high copy cloning vector. By replacing the zeocin resistance marker with trimethoprim resistance, deleting the parts upstream of -35 in the ampicilin resistance promoter and replacing the extended multiple cloning site with a single SpeI site, we managed to reduce the plasmid size to 903 bp, almost a 24% reduction in size compared to our previous world record.</description>

      <description>A Spatial Comparison of Molecular Features Associated with Resistance to Pembrolizumab in BCG Unresponsive Bladder Cancer
Authors: Meghani, K.; Frydenlund, N.; Yu, Y.; Choy, B.; Meeks, J. J.
Score: 11.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299093
BackgroundIntravenous immune checkpoint inhibition achieves a 40% three-month response in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS). Yet only half of early responders will continue to be disease free by 12 months, and resistance mechanisms are poorly defined.</description>

      <description>Hydrothermal vent fauna of the Galapagos Rift: Updated species list with new records
Authors: Chen, C.; Jamieson, J. W.; Tunnicliffe, V.
Score: 28.9, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568903
The sighting of giant bivalves and tubeworms at the Rose Garden vent field on the Galapagos Rift in 1977 marked the discovery of hydrothermal vents, a turning point for modern biology. The following decade saw a flurry of taxonomic descriptions of vent endemic species from the first vents.</description>
